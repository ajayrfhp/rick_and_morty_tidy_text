00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,557
You're a horse surgeon,
not a deer surgeon.

158
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,762
So...?

159
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,314
Well,
don't different animals...

160
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,857
require different levels
of skill to keep alive?

161
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,525
- Oh, god.
Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

162
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,897
Yes, Beth.

163
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,900
This is why you
don't freeze time, you guys.

164
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,572
It's incredibly
irresponsible.

165
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,866
And you did it so we could clean
the house after a party?

166
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,535
Look, there's no time
to hold me accountable, Morty.

167
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,362
Like, literally no time.
Look around.

168
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,698
Uncertainty
is inherently unsustainable.

169
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,875
Eventually, everything
either is or isn't.

170
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,373
And we've got about
four hours to be "ls."

171
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,500
- Or...?
- We isn't.

172
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,173
All right, since this time
crystal exists in both

173
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,249
possibilities,

174
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,589
and since it's impossible
that I didn't nail this,

175
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,466
I'm probably about
to press this button

176
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,639
in both possibilities
at exactly the same time.

177

- How do you know --
- How do you know that --

178
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,887
Whatever your asking me,
the answer is I'm amazing.

179
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,890
And away we go.

00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,604
Huh, what do you know.
It's working.

00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,311
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh shit.

183
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,488
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

184
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,735
I-I-I-I mean you four!

185
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,691
BOTH:
That hurt! That was painful.

186
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,742
Good, I'm glad it was painful.
You deserve it.

187
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,537
I saw you. Y-you're both [burps]
all over the damn place.

188
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,707
We've been split for
20 minutes and your lives

189
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,034
are already scattered
to the quantum fucking wind?

190
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,744
What the hell do
either of you two

191
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,296
have to be so uncertain about?
Your brand of zit cream?

192
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,373
Which chair to sit in
while I do everything?

193
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,629
Come on, spit it out!

194
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,630
Well, you don't exactly
make it easy, Rick.

195
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,052
You make fun of me
all the time...

196
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,629
You're always picking on me...
...and now Summer's doing it.

197
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,554
...and now you got Summer
to kiss your ass.

198
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,052
Me?! What about you'?

199
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,132
You're just as mean to me
because you're jealous...

200
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,182
could you get more excited
to see me fail?

201
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,760
Because you want grandpa
all to yourself!

202
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,641
All right, all right, cool it.
I see what's happening here.

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,347
You're both young,
you're both unsure

204
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,727
about your place
in the universe,

205
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,604
and you both want
to be Grandpa's favorite.

206
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,401
I can fix this.
Morty, sit here.

207
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,979
Summer, you sit here.
Now, listen.

208
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,655
I know the two of you
are very different

209
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,947
from each other
in a lot of ways,

210
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,400
but you have to understand

211
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,905
that as far
as Grandpa's concerned,

212
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,611
you're both pieces
of shit. Yeah.

213
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,946
I can prove it
mathematically.

214
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,656
Actually, l-l-let me
grab my white board.

215
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,412
This has been
a long time coming, anyway.

216
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,334
[tires screech ]

217
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,036
Emergency!
Wounded deer coming in.

218
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,746
[air hissing]
- Three.

219
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,581
Excuse me,
you can't be back here.

220
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,258
I'm a certified
horse surgeon,

221
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,006
and this deer
needs medical attention.

222
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,554
- Nurse, please move that snake.
- That's <i>my</i> nurse.

223
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,506
And as a horse surgeon,
I'm sure that you know

224
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,684
that deer have much smaller,
much more intricate organs.

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,761
As a vet, I'm sure you know
that a deer

226
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,267
is closer to a horse
than you are to a doctor.

227
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,725
So let's save the measuring
for when our dicks are out.

228
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,481
- It's time to save a life!
- Geez.

229
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,902
[ Grunts, sighs]

230
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,652
That's odd.
This deer's wounded.

231
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,732
Uh, yeah, I was there.
You don't have to rub it in.

232
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,944
I mean it's been shot
with a gun.

233
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,994
MAN:
My gun.

234
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,822
May I help <i>you,</i> sir?

235
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,533
No, but you can stop
helping this deer.

236
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,584
I shot it before these two
hit it with their car,

237
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,253
and I followed them
when they hauled it off.

238
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,705
This deer belongs
to me.

239
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,711
[ Sighs ] We don't have
time for this, okay?

240
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,588
I need anaesthetic
and deer saline.

241
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,715
Look, I don't know what
the law says about this,

242
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,968
but I took an oath that I would
let no animal come to harm.

243
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,765
Except when sterilizing,
aborting, or euthanizing them,

244
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,139
or also when eating them
at also any meal.

245
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,765
I'm calling my lawyer.

246
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,392
I hope for all our sakes
you're as bad a surgeon

247
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,438
as I am a hunter.

248
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,391
In your dreams, bitch.
Scalpel.

249
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,819
So, in conclusion,
you're both equally mercurial,

250
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,646
overly sensitive, clingy,

251

hysterical,
bird-brained homunculi.

252
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,362
And I honestly can't even tell
the two of you apart

253
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,534
half the time

254
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,781
because I don't go
by height or age,

255
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,613
I go by amount
of pain in my ass,

256
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,073
which makes you
both identical.

to merge us anymore.

he can save his own skin

it's [belches] easier

to eliminate one
of the possibilities

is that hunter's property
regardless of how far it runs

before it dies.

you're performing it on venison.

Actually,
I've decided not to eat it.

316

All this fear and conflict --
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

- Right.
- Okay.

[groans]
What did you guys do?

We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

341
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,233
and you caused
another time fracture.

Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

346
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,324
but time breaking twice
means our problem is

347
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,324
two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

348

Well, actually, I do expect
you to understand that.

349
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,912
It's basic math. C-can somebody
just let me out of here?

350
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,334
If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

351

Well, is there some way
you can prove

352

you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore'?

Oh, for god's sake.
All right, here.

Fine.
I'll just do it myself.

If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

it was what I wanted
to do, Morty.

between you and me.

Hey, guys, we're home.

TOGETHER:
Mom! Dad!

621
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,711
Uh, hold the phone.

622
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,293
Where did you guys
get those necklaces from?

623
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,674
Uh, Lady Gaga,
table for three. Am I right?

624
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,882
Are you guys
Power Rangers,

625
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,466
but only on one small part
of your necks?

Hey, do those things
need batteries?

627
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,803
Were they included?
Cleanup in the fruit aisle.

628
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,230
Not in a homophobic way,
though.

629
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,023
They're just fruity necklaces
is what I was saying.

630
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,065
I'm gonna pee my pants!

631

Somebody call
the planet of "Tron"!

632
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,189
Doesn't feel so
good, does it?

633
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,110
We have three "Tron"
people over here.

634
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,904
No, it doesn't.
It hurts.

635
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,107
Seriously, are these
halloween costumes?

636
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,407
Are you going
as motorcycles

637
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,235
with green headlights
instead of normal ones?

638
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,320
Are you dogs?
Robot dogs? [laughs]

639
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,781
Gosh,
you guys are lame.

640
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,741
Are those chokers
from the '90s?

641
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,498
What is this,
a '90s nostalgia thing?

642
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,047
Are you guys in that movie
"The Craft" with Fairuza Balk?

Hey, man,
when the hell were you?

Looking for you,
asshole.

647
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,209
I told you
past the dinosaurs.

648
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,541
You know how much time
is past the dinosaurs?

649
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,750
Half of all time!

650
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,801
Come on, man.
It's this way.

651
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,968
- Come on.
- Give me that thing.

Speed it up.
He can't be this far back.

653
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,592
No, no, there he is.
There he is. There he is.

654

There he is.
Stop, stop.

- So, that's the guy, huh?
- Yeah, that's him.

Hey, man.
Remember me?

I got something for your ass.
