Dumb [coughs] Name.

158
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,213
- Excuse me?
- [ clears throat] Nothing.

159
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,387
I mean, it's hard
for us to comprehend all this.

160
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,384
Would it be possible
for us to get some kind of tour

161
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,261
of your miniverse
from the inside?

162
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,887
This isn't a fucking
chocolate factory.

163
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,435
I don't have time.

164
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,888
Didn't you say time goes
more slowly in the miniverse

165
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,894
relative to the real world?

166
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,271
Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

167
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,773
Great President.
All right, let's go.

168
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,355
Whoa-Oh!

169
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,532
Hold on to something.

170
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,735
I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

171
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,364
until a world developed.

172
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,321
I then introduced
the people of this world

173
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,624
to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

174
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,542
I call
a flooble crank.

175
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,497
What they don't know is that 80%
of every crank's energy output

176
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,422
gets channeled
out of the miniverse

177
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,499
to be used by us.

178
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,176
No more gooble boxes.

179
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,003
RICK: I gotta tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

180
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,464
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

181
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,924
It's not cool.
- What?!

182
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,931
Y-Y-You got the people
on this world slaving away

183
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,637
making your power.

184
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,222
I mean, that's
what I call slavery.

185
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,057
No, no, no,
they work for each other

186
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,268
in exchange for money,
which they then --

187
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,571
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

188
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,401
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

189
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,700
Rick, a word?

190
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,823
What the hell was that?

191
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,654
I know.
"eek barba dirkle"?

192
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,205
That's a pretty
fucked up "ooh la la."

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,907
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

194
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,788
that his miniverse is
unethical?

195
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,915
D-Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

196
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,089
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy!

197
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,962
Somewhere on this planet,
there's gotta be an arrogant...

198
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,510
scientist prick on the verge
of microverse technology,

199
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,713
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

200
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,969
forcing Zeep
to say microverses are bad,

201
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,847
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being.

202
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,349
His people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

203
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,977
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

204
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,979
Eating that motherfucking
ice cream!

205
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,901
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

206
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,196
Wh-Wh-Why are you making
that face?

207
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,692
Holy shit!

208
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,866
It's me. I've convinced
the people of this planet

209
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,818
that I'm a traveler
from another world.

210
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,869
You don't think that's over-
[burps]... doing it a little?

211
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,073
I mean, you can achieve the same
effect with a pair of --

212
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,249
Never mind. You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,576

- A long time ago...

I implanted you with

call upon dormant nanobots
in your bloodstream

and turn you into a car.

- Oh, my god!
- Concentrate, Morty.

We will stop bombing them,
