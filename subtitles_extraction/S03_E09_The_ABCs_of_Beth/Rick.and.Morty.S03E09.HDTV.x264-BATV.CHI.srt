We're in the middle
of an adventure.

288
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,180
Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

289
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,280
Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

290
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,780
and, clearly, Morty.

291
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,350
But Tommy's
still in there,

292
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,120
raping Muppets
and eating babies.

293
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,650
Yep. Luckily,
that's not our problem.

294
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,750
Time to pull the plug.

295
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,190
Pull the plug?

296
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,890
We have to get Tommy
out of there, okay?

297
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
We -- We need to do
the right thing.

298
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,530
Do what you never did
as a dad --

299
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,730
Put in a little effort.

300
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,460
All right,
cut the high-road routine.

301

We both saw
Tommy's shitty play.

302

You pushed him
in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

303

His very happy life
is in your hands.

304
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
You go save him
from it.

my own daughter.

It won't kill you.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

312

You know why all Ricks
made a Froopyland

for all their
little girls?

314
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,920
Same reason
I wasn't surprised

315
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,690

badly structured,

I didn't make Froopyland

you know, cloning a replacement

that might cross
your socio-path.

326

You would rather believe
I'm evil

327
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,510
than admit that
you were a bad father?

Oh, dude, no.

No, bad father all the way

to make you as a kid.

334
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,350
Ray guns.

335

A whip that forces people
to like you.

336
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,990
Invisibility cuffs,
a parent trap, a lightning gun,

a teddy bear with
anatomically correct innards,

night-vision googly-eye glasses,

false fingerprints,

a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

a pink,

Hi, Beth,

Shall we resume
stabbing?

347

Has it occurred to you

348
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,260
that I asked you
to make those things

349
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,020
because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

350

Has it occurred to you that
<i>if</i> I did try killing Tommy,

351
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,760
it might be because
I was jealous of his family?

Wait, what?
Why?

Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

to believe I pushed you.

432
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Oh, do I get
to have that?

433
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,050
Is my reality like
a little side of fries --

434
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,790
a little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

435
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,460
Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

436
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,290
because I'm not
a petty piece of [bleep]

437
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,390
So, then,
it should be pretty easy

438
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,700
to say,
"Sorry I pushed you."

439
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,160
Real easy
and not necessary,

440
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,770
since you coming home
will save your dad's life

441
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,130

Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,260
I feel like
I've spent my life

524
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,940
pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

525
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,470
And the ugly truth
has always been --

526
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,440
That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

527
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,540
Am I evil?

528
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,240
Worse.
You're smart.

529
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,480
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

530
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,580
And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

531
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,320
The universe is
basically an animal.

532
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,620
It grazes
on the ordinary.

533
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,920
It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

534
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
not unlike
your friend Timmy.
Tommy.

535
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
Yeah, it hardly matters now,
sweetie.

536
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,490
You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

537
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,790
take reality for a ride,

538
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,500
but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

539
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,700
And, eventually,
it will.

540
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,560
There's no
other way off.

541
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,930
Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

542
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,940
So who am I?
What do I do?

543
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,740
My advice --
Take off.

544
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,110
Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

545
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,310
I can't do that.

546
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,080
The kids,
Jerry, my job,

547
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,080
and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

548
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,180
I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

549
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
with all your memories.

550
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,720
An exact copy
in every way.

551
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,890
It'll love and provide
for the kids,

552
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,890
do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

553
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,390
on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

554
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,590
You could be gone a day,
a week,

555
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,000
or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

556
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,330
The moment you decide
to come back,

557
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,770
I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

558
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,540
It feels no pain,
it regrets nothing,

559
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,110
and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

560
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,770
If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

561
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,680
I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

562
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,410
Or maybe
it makes you matter.

563
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,650
Maybe I love you.

564
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,710
Maybe something about
your mother.

565
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,420
Don't jump a gift shark
in the mouth.

566
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,690
I don't know
if I can do it.

567
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,650
Then stay,
and luxuriate in a life

568
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,590
you can finally know
you've chosen.

569
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,030
My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

570
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,760
you're finally gonna
chill the [bleep] out.

571

Look, I got someone pregnant

None of this is on purpose.

it has nothing to do
with us?

Hold on a second.
