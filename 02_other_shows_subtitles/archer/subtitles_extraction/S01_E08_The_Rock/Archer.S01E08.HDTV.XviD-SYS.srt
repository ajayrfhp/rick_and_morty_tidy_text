1
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,323
Ohh, why the hell is your phone on?

2
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,989
Because I have a social life!

3
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:34,787
Yello?

4
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:36,264
Why the hell is your phone on?

5
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:38,116
Because I have -- why did you call?

6
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:39,474
Because this is important.

7
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:40,402
Micromanagitis.

8
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:44,153
If we show san marino the flaws
in their palace Security,

9
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:47,335
they've agreed to hire us
as security consultants.

10
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:49,925
And I'm sure I don't need to
remind you that we haven't

11
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,592
Gotten one of these jobs
since your uffizi fiasco.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,879
And yet, you always do.

13
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,732
Because you learned
nothing from it.

14
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:01,611
I learned that "Flammable"
And "Inflammable"

15
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:02,707
Mean the same thing.

16
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:03,286
Wait, what?

17
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:05,125
Well, this time make sure you --

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,344
Mother! Oh, my god!

19
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:07,825
We've been spotted,
and they're shooting at us!

20
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,007
Oh, my! Oh, god!

21
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,461
Bet she's freaking out right now.

22
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,851
Oh, my god!

23
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,697
What shade is that --

24
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,389
Crack-whore red?

25
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,358
You said they were
tranquilizer darts!

26
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,284
Ah, I merely implied that.

27
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:20,989
Damn it!

28
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:23,133
So I poisoned like five
innocent security guards?

29
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,141
Would you relax?

30
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,697
I'm pretty sure san marino
has universal healthcare.

31
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:28,644
So? So, that's good for Them

32
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,705
cause there's gonna be
some neurological damage.

33
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,467
Oh, my. Lana.

34
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:37,059
That is one serious diamond.

35
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,212
but is it supposed to be brown?

36
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,454
It's not brown, pam.

37
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,909
That color is called "Champagne."

38
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,103
Mm-hmm, and why do you have it?

39
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:50,201
Because I...Am gonna
ask lana to marry me.

40
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,383
And you're gonna give
her that if she says no?

41
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,800
Like a big "Screw you and your
big lincoln log-y fingers"?

42
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:32,679
So, the last thing you hear
me say is, "Oh, my god!

43
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:35,430
They're shooting at us!
" And you don't even call me back?

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,257
Well, I knew you weren't
in any real danger --

45
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,821
You know, with lana there.

46
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,119
And let's just knock
off the giggling.

47
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,551
I want game faces on those heads

48
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,897
For our conference
call with the prince.

49
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:49,819
I thought he was a captain regent.

50
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,957
Oh, whatever.

51
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,580
All of san marino could
fit in the south bronx.

52
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,881
The important thing is,
they're loaded.

53
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,133
just

54
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,279
Shitfaced!

55
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:01,677
About 15 freakin' beers,
all that schuetzie, and --

56
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:04,661
holy Shit! -- Did I honk
down a bunch of absinthe?

57
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,351
I don't know, pam,
but could you lower your voice?

58
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,854
I must have, 'cause I hallucinated

59
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,563
you had an engagement ri--

60
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,293
Not...Another...Word!

61
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,716
and just what is this, I ask you?

62
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:19,517
Hello, cheryl. What the --

63
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,525
cyril, are you cheating on me?

64
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,933
No, just trying to
get my muffin back.

65
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,591
uh, no, you're not! I'm not?

66
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,529
not like that.

67
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,209
You got to slug her in the
diaphragm with a forearm shiver!

68
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,635
That's good to know.

69
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:32,398
do it!

70
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,584
and no muffin. See?

71
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,857
Time lost is muffin lost, along

72
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:47,585
With my appetite -
for food, that is.

73
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,367
come see me.

74
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,797
Wow, I am incredibly sorry.

75
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,426
But that is my decision,
ms. Archer.

76
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:57,158
And as captain regent of san --

77
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,864
I don't care if you're captain...

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,981
Crunch! No, wait, beefheart.

79
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,270
Claudio, we had a deal.

80
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,387
No, wait -- kangaroo.

81
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,761
And we pointed out every
single flaw in your

82
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,335
Cut-rate security system.

83
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,859
And now not only are you
hiring another agency...

84
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:09,489
There was a captain kangaroo.

85
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,718
...You won't even pay isis
for that security probe!

86
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,430
Which means no bonuses for us.

87
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,917
Wait, what? malory: Oh,
now he cares.

88
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,855
Those monies will
go to medical care

89
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,504
for the palace
guards they poisoned.

90
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:20,483
What? Lana did that!

91
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,672
I -- claudio:
And as for hiring odin --

92
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:23,559
Odin?!

93
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,832
Uh, skipper,
if I could jump in here...

94
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,119
Trexler!

95
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,043
Oh, malory.

96
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:33,351
Even on -- what is this,
1080p? -- You look just as

97
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:36,852
Supple and sexy as the day
I first laid eyes on you.

98
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,126
Where -- in a wax museum?

99
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,120
Sterling, that's no way
to talk to your mother.

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,494
And just who in the hell
do you think you are?

101
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:44,805
Getting isis blacklisted
at the u.N.?

102
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:46,045
Had nothing to do with that.

103
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,481
Embarrassing me in berlin?

104
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,296
The entire hotel was embarrassed.

105
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,856
Stealing all my
prospective clients?

106
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,190
N-- yeah.

107
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,139
And no matter which way I turn,
you're butting in

108
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,023
That big, fat, strong,
aquiline nose of yours.

109
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:02,247
Wait. What? trexler:
You said it was the nose of a caesar.

110
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,077
Well, perhaps a lesser caesar.

111
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:05,894
No, no.

112
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,269
Now, I clearly remember
you said "Augustus"

113
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,814
And "In vino Veritas."

114
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,536
And the chianti was
definitely flowing...

115
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,987
Among other things. Mother!

116
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,461
Hmm? Oh, uh, this is

117
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,536
The last time you make me
out a fool, len trexler!

118
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,476
You want to play me hard? Phrasing.

119
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,128
You have no idea. Well, then, you

120
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:25,736
Better nut up... Phrasing.

121
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,670
...Because I've swallowed
just about as much as

122
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,832
I can take from you!

123
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,065
Hey! Phrasing!

124
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,019
...And we'll see who's
smirking when isis steals

125
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,370
That diamond for real!

126
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,936
Ooh, you're a naughty girl.

127
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,725
Right, then!

128
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:42,259
Commence operation "Rub len
trexler's big fat nose in it!"

129
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,694
Sounds like you already have.

130
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:45,657
Wait. You want us to break
back into the palace,

131
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,052
Which now has the insane amount

132
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:48,880
Of security we recommended, plus

133
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,877
God knows how many odin guys...

134
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,499
Yes, so take more of that poison.

135
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,728
...And on top of that suck salad,
you want to sprinkle

136
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,009
On the bacon bits of, "Oh, hey,

137
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,546
Let's tell them we're coming"?!

138
00:05:58,495 --> 00:05:59,929
Well? Well, there's this new

139
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,810
Thing called the
element of surprise?

140
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,938
I'm so sorry I slammed
you in the gut.

141
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,655
Geez, that's how houdini died.

142
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,703
Houdini died of aids. No!

143
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,359
Why do you always say that?

144
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,969
And that's the thing -
I want to surprise lana.

145
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, you nailed it.

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,571
So, this time, I need you
to not be your normal,

147
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:17,423
Compulsively blabby self.

148
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,639
W-when have I ever been blabby?

149
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,808
guess who has breast cancer.

150
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,280
Just one of like two

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,457
Dozen equally appalling
videos on your website.

152
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,719
They're not all equally

153
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,553
App-- ohh, and have I blabbed

154
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:33,545
About you and cheryl?

155
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,972
She keeps seducing me!

156
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:37,052
And you think you can make
that unhappen if you give

157
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,221
Lana a tiny flake of brown mica?

158
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,563
Cyril, look at it!

159
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,141
But I spent two months' salary.

160
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,975
I know, but you make shit.

161
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,757
Hey, I'm doing pretty well,
thank you.

162
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,923
Save the speech for the father
you continually disappoint.

163
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,305
I'm head of h.R., cyril.

164
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,305
I know your take-home.

165
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah, and I -- I --

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,296
I take home shit!

167
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,392
Well, we all do.

168
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:59,925
But what's my father ever
done that's so great --

169
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,534
School superintendent?!

170
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:02,437
Big whoop!

171
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:03,913
There's only like 800 kids in

172
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:05,983
The entire county, "K" Through

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,993
12!

174
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,382
I'm sorry. Uh, you were saying?

175
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,841
I were saying, we all

176
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,949
Make shit, so what we
should do is unionize!

177
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,185
Yeah! I'll get the raise I deserve.

178
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,179
Then you can buy
lana a big-boy ring.

179
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,777
She'll promptly agree to marry me.

180
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:23,086
Then you can take her home
to meet your dick dad.

181
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:25,573
And then I shove his hawk
face right into her big

182
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,045
Brown boobs and scream,
"Look at these babies, old man!

183
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,788
Didn't need a varsity
letter to get those, did I?!

184
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,689
So now who's a disappointment?!"

185
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,806
Oh, jesus h. Jones, pam.

186
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,744
What?Pwpw

187
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,027
Carol? Carol?

188
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,242
Oh, wait.

189
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:46,715
Cheryl? Cheryl?

190
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:47,956
Hello?

191
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,095
Cheryl, I swear to god, if I

192
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,792
Have to open my own salad again,
i will freak out!

193
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,537
W-where the hell is everybody?

194
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,734
So, let's assume we

195
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,161
Can't access the palace
through that same skylight.

196
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:01,499
Okay. But maybe we overlooked

197
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,913
An air shaft, or maybe even some

198
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,043
Access below grade.

199
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,860
So let's pull up the
palace schematics.

200
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,636
Um, okay.

201
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:08,937
Maybe today... Hang on.

202
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,842
...If that works for you.

203
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,373
Um, let me see.

204
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,731
How about now? Anything?

205
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,225
No. Uh, how about now?

206
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,505
No. How about now?

207
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,019
No. What are you doing

208
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,211
Back there? I don't know!

209
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,945
What are you -
just hitting random keys?

210
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,037
Well, obviously!

211
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,529
Ohh, damn it, we --

212
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:23,966
Where's the hobbit guy?

213
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,794
A frickin' hobbit works here? No,
he's just a --

214
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:29,115
Lana, they're called "Little people,
" Not "Hobbits."

215
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:31,346
Will you --
he's a hobbit enthusiast.

216
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,157
Well, yeah, but he also
knows how to work all the

217
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:34,989
Computers and satellites and shit.

218
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,224
But even though I do

219
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,848
All that, I got to live with a

220
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,303
Roommate in queens.

221
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,100
Another example of how

222
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,667
Underpaid the isis
support staff really is.

223
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,059
And I, for one, am fed up!

224
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,457
yeah, fed full of
muffins and denial.

225
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,132
What's your problem, neck bones?

226
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,522
my problem is, I remember

227
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:55,052
What ms. Archer did to
the cleaning ladies!

228
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:56,801
you sure, missus?

229
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,205
Is plenty of space.

230
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,231
No, gracias.

231
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,690
okay.

232
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,429
Ha! How's that for bread and roses?

233
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:11,941
oh, my goodness.

234
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,243
Yeah, that was pretty sad.

235
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,575
what's sad is now nobody

236
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,993
Restocks the stupid machine in

237
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,438
The bathroom, so I have
to make my own tampons.

238
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:19,550
tampons?

239
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,646
Well, I don't know what that is.

240
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,993
exactly, and so I say no union!

241
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,053
yeah!

242
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,318
No, no, no, wait.

243
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,677
Hunh-unh. Don't listen to the

244
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,227
"Makes her own tampons" Person!

245
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,852
Listen to your hearts

246
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,464
Because deep down you know

247
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:34,777
They're exploiting us.

248
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,875
But if we unite,
we can put a stop to it.

249
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,640
And that supply closet is just

250
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,537
Packed with poster board and

251
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,273
Markers and maybe
even some glitter!

252
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:46,681
So, who's with me
on the picket line?!

253
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,520
and me!

254
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,480
Really?

255
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,388
you had me at "Put."

256
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:55,331
Yes, we need a sound sensor.

257
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:56,051
Duh!

258
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,909
God, where is that equipment guy?

259
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,797
And where the hell are the jumars?

260
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,872
Yeah, I don't know.
This was all I could find.

261
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,521
I'm thinking goggles -- yes.

262
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,911
Shovels -- I don't know
how or why we'd use 'em.

263
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,917
Cheryl!

264
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,205
She's not in here!

265
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,783
Well, why are you in here?

266
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,144
Is the san marino
diamond in here now?

267
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,701
It might be, for all we know.

268
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,705
We can't find any of

269
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,257
The gear we need, we've got no

270
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,539
Satcoms, no new intel, and so,

271
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,053
Basically, we are totally

272
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,505
Unprepared for this mission!

273
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,703
Unless it involves night-shoveling.

274
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,235
Well, I want that diamond,
not to mention my

275
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,754
"Rapidly approaching room

276
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,121
Temperature" Cobb salad, so --

277
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,625
Damn it. Where the hell
are all the drones?

278
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,857
what do we want? Unfair!

279
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,963
when do we want it? Change!

280
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:40,527
Okay, so they're bad chanters,
but overall, this

281
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:41,719
Strike's shaping up.

282
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,095
How? Nobody knows
why we're striking.

283
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,264
Well, we can't say, "Hey,
right upstairs is a

284
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:47,899
Top secret intelligence agency."

285
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,786
But it looks like we're

286
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,301
Picketing the cleaners!

287
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,207
No, it doesn't. Jesus!

288
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,674
stop picketing the cleaners!

289
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:56,069
You were saying?

290
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,848
Why are people
picketing the cleaners?

291
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,018
I predicted this.

292
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,082
It's curry fury.

293
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,815
Holy shit. Is that cyril?

294
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:03,667
And pam, krieger,

295
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,007
Carol, all the...

296
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,116
Drones!

297
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:07,032
They're not picketing the

298
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,982
Cleaners -- they're picketing isis!

299
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:09,829
What's their beef?

300
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,355
Oh, the same entitled

301
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,261
Crap as always -
"I can't make ends meet."

302
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,449
"I'm on food stamps."

303
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:16,781
"My child died because I

304
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,149
Couldn't afford new bone

305
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,362
Marrow" -- just, "Me,
me, me, me, me!"

306
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:21,710
Jesus, whose kid died?

307
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,877
Oh, who remembers?

308
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,130
Check pam's blog.

309
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,445
And done, but if you

310
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,525
Still want us to steal you
that gigantic diamond...

311
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,774
Well, obviously.

312
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:30,891
...We're gonna have to
cross their picket line.

313
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,695
Well, screw that.
Yeah, what's with all the bottles?

314
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,759
It's like a trailer-park easter.

315
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:38,582
lousy commies!

316
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:39,679
Go back to quebec!

317
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,575
Jesus!

318
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,717
Okay, strike's over, everybody.

319
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:44,454
No, hold that line.

320
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,245
We deserve a raise, and lana

321
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:48,085
Deserves a real ring, so --

322
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:49,975
Okay, so, let's go

323
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,024
Out the back.

324
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,351
Oh, my god!

325
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:55,457
Happy easter, cyril. Lana.

326
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:57,923
Oh, baby, what happened to you?

327
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,767
Well, see, I wanted to buy you a --

328
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,036
Cyril, this is not that moment.

329
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,081
And we don't talk to management.

330
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,811
or ham-fisted whores.

331
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,533
What?

332
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,116
Yeah, no, they're right.

333
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:08,633
What?!

334
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,629
No, not the whore part -
management.

335
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,433
But we're not
technically management.

336
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,684
But you make shitloads
more than we do.

337
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,665
Even though you
totally depend on us.

338
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:17,515
On you?

339
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,150
Hey, we're out there risking our

340
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,451
Lives every -- many of the days!

341
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,396
And so, yes,
we get paid a little more.

342
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:25,633
How much a little more?

343
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,010
Well, it's complicated...

344
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,194
No, it isn't. Don't answer that!

345
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:29,265
...What with salary and

346
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,616
Performance incentives
and all the bonuses.

347
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:32,677
Bonuses?!

348
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,702
dump her, cyril! Hey, crazy,
go macrame some tampons!

349
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:37,531
oh, you want to hear
something crazy?

350
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,436
Cyril -- thank you, pam.

351
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,719
Now look, lana -- baby,

352
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,157
"Take charge cyril" Is
totally doing it for me.

353
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,632
It really is, but we're
on a vital mission here.

354
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,514
Vital mission?
Not on the master clipboard.

355
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,349
So, just how vital is it?

356
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:51,620
It's incredibly vital

357
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,081
Because if they don't steal me

358
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,654
That huge diamond,
I will literally die.

359
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,486
A diamond? In this economy?

360
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,833
You're stealing a diamond for her?

361
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,171
Oh, irony.

362
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,980
And the rest of you, back to work!

363
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,907
If that salad isn't
open in the next --

364
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:09,804
get 'em! Stop surging!

365
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,153
Archer, do something!

366
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:12,681
I am doing something!

367
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:13,804
What are you doing?!

368
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:17,031
Lana, out the back!

369
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,711
Move! Hey, cyril!

370
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,923
Cyril! Cyril!!

371
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:22,517
What?!

372
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:24,766
I'm saving lana, as usual!

373
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:25,945
Hey, shut up!

374
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:32,645
Frickin' odin.

375
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,862
I can't believe this.

376
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:35,337
How many are there?
About a jillion.

377
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:38,003
Damn it. A jillion
gay little copycats.

378
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,652
What? I mean, I didn't invent
the turtleneck, lana, but

379
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,854
I was the first to recognize its

380
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,443
Potential as a tactical garment.

381
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,903
The tactical turtleneck, lana.

382
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,999
Archer. The "Tactleneck."

383
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,423
Can you please focus? Not really.

384
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:52,579
I don't think these goggles
were properly calibrated.

385
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,947
Ditto the sound sensor and
the stupid code cloner --

386
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,404
All the gear those sweaty
tech dweebs normally --

387
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,329
Do we take the drones for granted?

388
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:02,674
No, no, no, lana.

389
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,355
Do not make this about them.

390
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,239
No, no, no.

391
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,067
That is utterly unacceptable.

392
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,053
It's just a
cost-of-living adjustment.

393
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,713
It's strong-arm robbery!

394
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,044
Come on, ms. Archer.

395
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,928
You've been in there 10 hours.

396
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,345
Meet us halfway, and krieger
will let you out of there.

397
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:19,665
Or else he'll crank
up the heat again!

398
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:22,561
I love that you
know how to do that.

399
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,396
And I love that I

400
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,201
Have an erection that didn't

401
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:26,512
Involve homeless people.

402
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:30,135
And you're cool with krieger
shuckin' your side corn?

403
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,251
Yeah, that is a
huge win-win for me.

404
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,851
You hear that, ms. Archer?

405
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,781
We're all on board for
the big win-win out here!

406
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:39,375
Well, I'm not!
Do your worst, krieger!

407
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,081
Okay. oh, my god, yes!

408
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,403
Yes, go ahead! Crank up the heat!

409
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,659
I'm as naked as the day I was born!

410
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,892
Naked or not... Well,
don't keep saying it.

411
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,917
...You can't stay in there forever.

412
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,049
Ha! I'll outlast you!

413
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,766
I'm naked, and I've got
half a lime and almost...

414
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,805
Nearly 2/3 of a half-gallon of --

415
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:05,927
Shit.

416
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:07,251
Now we got her!

417
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,513
Ha! I'll suck it straight
off this grimy linoleum

418
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:12,546
Before I give in
to you bellyachers!

419
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,039
You've got nothing!

420
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,467
No code cloner, no gps.

421
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,839
Ugh! We've got no thermal imaging!

422
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,484
Lana, we don't need gadgets.

423
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,585
Oh, really?
Machines are gonna fail.

424
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,501
Then the system's gonna fail.

425
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,245
And then it's "Who has
the ability to survive?"

426
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,759
And that's the game,
lana -- survival.

427
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,250
Just watched
"Deliverance" Again, huh?

428
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,860
I mean, is burt reynolds
not the man in that?

429
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,369
On the raft...

430
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,856
With the vest, huh?

431
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,239
You know, he did his own stunts.

432
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,086
I know!

433
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:45,151
He did his own stunts!

434
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,479
Keep your frickin' voice --

435
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,119
Aah! God!

436
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,096
Sweet jesus, the goggles!

437
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,755
intruders! get them!

438
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,505
Aah, lana! Lana, I'm blind!

439
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:56,525
Yeah? I'm blind!

440
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,597
Should I go on without you?

441
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:00,432
What? No, carry me, monster-hands!

442
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,973
Jesus! Quit bouncing my eyes!

443
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:11,074
Shut up! I'm trying
to get us an evac,

444
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,939
But nobody's answer-- oh, holy

445
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,618
Shit, are they still on strike?

446
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey, eugene debs, it's only
been about 10 hours, all right?

447
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,513
So you'd rather die in
there than give us a

448
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,407
Cost-of-living adjustment?

449
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,019
Yes! oh, no.

450
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,582
I can arrange that. Crunch!

451
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:30,119
I love that you
know how to do that.

452
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,564
Well, now you're trapped.

453
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,949
Happy? Yes!

454
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,263
Laundry. Oh, wait, are we open?

455
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:39,053
What? Sir, you have to slow --

456
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,191
Geezy petes,
get a load of this guy.

457
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:43,188
We're taking heavy fire,
and we need a frickin'

458
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:44,742
Extraction, you dumbass!

459
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,690
Lana!

460
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,395
She thought you were a man.
Shut up!

461
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,560
Cyril, baby,
we're pinned down, okay?

462
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,235
We need a -- aah! Lana!

463
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,749
What's going on? We need evac -
a helo, a jump jet --

464
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,615
Uh, at this point, really anything.

465
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,345
Well, don't just
stand there, idiots!

466
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,987
Yeah, come on!
Get 'em out of there!

467
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,568
Uh, you'd need the
satcom link to do that.

468
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,608
So? So it's upstairs.

469
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,999
And, uh...

470
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:08,971
Someone broke the elevator.

471
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,263
And miss fire hazard in

472
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,524
There bricked up
the only stairwell!

473
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:14,813
Don't talk to me
about fire hazards.

474
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,877
All you people did
in there was smoke!

475
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,143
Aah, god, I'm hit! Lana!

476
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:21,333
Will somebody please do something?!

477
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,383
Like what, cyril?

478
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:24,769
I'm blind! No, us! Here!

479
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,391
Krieger, bilbo, come

480
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,151
On -- can't you guys do something?

481
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,596
Wh-- no!

482
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,527
Oh, wait, I meant "Yes."

483
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,688
Roger that, zebra two. Stand by.

484
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,474
Helo's 10-4.

485
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,599
He just needs you to upload your

486
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,713
Gps coordinates into his h.U.D.

487
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,919
Which I will do with
these cellphones.

488
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,651
Holy shit. You geeks are badass.

489
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,945
Well, we couldn't have
done it without an

490
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,722
Electrical insulator, so thank

491
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:52,276
Cyril for the tiny brown diamond.

492
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:54,368
What? Oh, wait.
Lana, did we get the diamond?

493
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:57,455
What? No. But, cyril,
why did you have a diamond?

494
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:01,166
Oh, uh, just my ear stud,
you know, from college.

495
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,287
Really? Called it.

496
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:05,614
And, again, you do
realize it'll be totally

497
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:06,585
Destroyed in the process?

498
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,568
Yes, just hurry up, please!

499
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:13,564
Okay, uploading gps coordinate-
wait a second.

500
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,283
Damn it! We don't have a second!

501
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,465
Lana, I'm sure we have one second.

502
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:18,719
But, seriously, it does sound

503
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,080
Like we're about to be overrun,

504
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,873
So... Get my son out of there!

505
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,730
What the hell are you
people waiting for?!

506
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,983
A goddamn cost-of-living
adjustment!

507
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,909
What?! Hey, yeah.

508
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,885
No, krieger, this is
not the time for this.

509
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,510
It is exactly the time!

510
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,457
So, what's it gonna be, you harpy?

511
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,697
You ever want to
see your son again?

512
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,015
Not at the number you quoted me.

513
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:43,208
Mother! That number is pegged
to the consumer price index!

514
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,839
Where -- the people's
republic of canada?

515
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:48,043
Jesus, take it out of our bonuses!

516
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,344
What? Mother, no, listen to me.

517
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:53,178
Aah! I'm hit! I'm hit,
and I'm blind.

518
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:56,519
Jesus, ms. Archer,
your child is dying.

519
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,098
Oh, all right.

520
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:00,386
If they'll give up their
bonuses... Mother!

521
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:03,391
...You can have your lousy
cost-of-living adjustment.

522
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,577
Something good's happening!

523
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,107
And you can have
your dick son back.

524
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,079
What's going on?
I hear a helicopter!

525
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,157
Oh, yeah!

526
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,212
Holy shit!

527
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:19,178
My other senses are
already heightened!

528
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,142
Hey, this time I saved lana.

529
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:24,297
But, oh, god, pam,
two months' salary.

530
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,695
Cyril, you can't put a
price on good pussy.

531
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,441
Roger that, zebra two.

532
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:31,677
Hey, the helo's got 'em!
They're safe!

533
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,587
hooray. way to go.

534
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,797
Then get me out of this sweatbox...

535
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:43,212
Because I am officially out of gin.

536
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,631
Oh, come on, archer.

537
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,008
Not now. I'm serious.

538
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,798
Hey, I'm serious.

539
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:51,769
Look at me, seriously, lana.

540
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,335
And forget the eye bandage, but

541
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:55,389
The hair, the strong jawline --

542
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:56,363
Who do I remind you of?

543
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,575
Nobody. Say it.

544
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:58,493
Please don't make me do this.

545
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,716
Say it. Say it!

00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,652
No, not in "Deliverance"...

548
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,488
In "Gator"! Right?
