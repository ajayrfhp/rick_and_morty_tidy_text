1
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:06,028
LANA: Archer, do something!

2
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:09,965
ARCHER: Sure thing, Lana...
Oh wait, I can't, because I left my lightsaber

3
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:12,034
in my other space-pants!

4
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,366
LANA: Don't yell at me,
this was your idea!

5
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:16,872
ARCHER: What?! Remind me, when was it that
I said "Guys, great idea!

6
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:20,342
Let's get shangaied to go
live on frickin Mars!"

7
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,143
KELLOGG: Keep moving.

8
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,045
ARCHER: Make meowwwww!

9
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,080
HORIZON DRONE 1: (chuckling)

10
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,984
He said meow... ARCHER: Moving, yes,
and how can I help you not ever

11
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:29,285
do that again please?

12
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:30,119
KELLOGG: Get in there.

13
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:33,488
ARCHER: In here sounds great.

14
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:35,190
DRAKE: are the cuffs really necessary?

15
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,460
KELLOGG: Archer broke
both of Wu's arms.

16
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:37,961
DRAKE: He what?!

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,097
KELLOGG: While shouting "woo."

18
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,332
ARCHER: Happy coincidence.

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,967
DRAKE: Mr. Archer, do I
have to sedate you?!

20
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,471
ARCHER: Well, I wouldn't say no to a drink...
LANA: Archer?

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,439
ARCHER: What, you want one?

22
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:52,645
Okay, can we get two -- my tongue says
sangria, but my heart says-- LANA: Archer.

23
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:55,116
ARCHER: Michelada.
LANA: You realize this is kidnapping.

24
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:55,817
DRAKE: I do, yes.

25
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,452
LANA: And do you realize
you're insane?!

26
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,288
ARCHER: Well he wouldn't, by definition--
DRAKE: What's more insane?

27
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:04,259
Suffering through famine, war,
and disease on a dying Earth?

28
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:07,096
Or creating a utopia on Mars?

29
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:09,732
LANA: Using me as your,
your brood sow?!

30
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:14,204
DRAKE: No, not -- well okay yes, technically,
but we searched for so long to

31
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,473
find the perfect human female specimen!

32
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:17,670
GILLETTE: Well that's flattering.

33
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:18,785
Ish.

34
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:22,414
DRAKE: And with your morphology,
your IQ, your medical history...

35
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,382
LANA: How'd you get
my medical records?!

36
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,587
KRIEGER: Don't judge me on the how...
Until you see the why.

37
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,623
HOLOGRAM: Oh, Kareega-san!

38
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,226
I nevah jooja you.
KRIEGER: Well your mother sure as hell does!

39
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,928
DRAKE: How isn't important.

40
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,730
What is important --
ARCHER: Is you hired ISIS just

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,566
so Lana could pump out a
bunch of Martian babies?!

42
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,569
DRAKE: Only if by "Martian"
you mean "born on Mars,"

43
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,804
not actual alien life-forms.

44
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:47,972
ARCHER: Oh.

45
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,208
Whatever, either way, my point is
this whole thing is Lana's fault --

46
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:51,642
LANA: What?!

47
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,779
ARCHER: -- and since you obviously
don't need any more dudes on Mars --

48
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,346
LANA: Archer!

49
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,117
ARCHER: Lana, the penis-to-your-vagina ratio
around here is creepy enough already.

50
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,556
So why not let us three go, and --
DRAKE: I'm afraid that's impossible --

51
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,090
ARCHER: Or just me.

52
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,726
DRAKE: -- because even if we didn't
need all the manpower we can get,

53
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,761
there's no ship to take
you back to Earth.

54
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,598
ARCHER: Yeah no, the shuttle, it's --
DRAKE: It's going to

55
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,168
push the Horizon into orbit above
Mars, to serve as our base while we

56
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:17,237
begin the terraforming.

57
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:18,238
Which reminds me.

58
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:22,108
Captain Kellogg, there are
three women on the intrepid.

59
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:25,845
Take a boarding party, and bring
them back here to join their friends.

60
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,413
PAM: Holy shitspace!

61
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,448
Hey guys, we got a problem!

62
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:29,982
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh!

63
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,152
The party's starting and this
dress makes me look like a whore!

64
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,622
MALORY: Oh, you don't look like an whore...
An idiot, maybe.

65
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,323
CHERYL/CAROL: Wh-?!

66
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,458
MALORY: Or both.

67
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,750
Yes, a... whordiot.

68
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:53,591

69
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,104
DRAKE: Agent Kane, I --
may I call you Lana?

70
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,154
LANA: You absolutely may not.

71
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,807
DRAKE: Fair enough, but I
wish you'd reconsider.

72
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,989
You'd be much more
comfortable in my quarters.

73
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,711
LANA: Ha!
You'll have to sedate me.

74
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,580
DRAKE: Oh, we wouldn't do that.

75
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:36,917
We need you in peak physical condition
for this great undertaking of ours.

76
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:37,852
All of you.

77
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:40,421
ARCHER: So wait, are
we not doing drinks?

78
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,890
GILLETTE: Ha!
I'm not helping you terraform Mars!

79
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,926
I won't move a cup of dirt!

80
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,327
ARCHER: Can we at least have beers?

81
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:51,098
DRAKE: Then you can join the um...
we're calling them involuntary laborers."

82
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,301
ARCHER: Involun -- wait,
you mean slaves?!

83
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,537
LANA: Oh now he's indignant...
ARCHER: Oh please, all you have to do is sit

84
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:57,705
around all day getting laid!

85
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:00,775
DRAKE: Involuntary labor is
just a temporary measure!

86
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:05,446
In a few generations, after the colony
is established, we'll revisit the issue.

87
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,549
In the meantime --
ARCHER: You can kiss three-fifths of my ass!

88
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:12,686
KELLOGG: Uh, Tony, we've got a problem...
DRAKE: Ugh, what now?

89
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,588
I'm on my way.

90
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,389
ARCHER: And the black
guy's okay with this?!

91
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,457
LANA: [sound of weary disgust]

92
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:18,458
ARCHER: What!

93
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,160
Oh for -- how was that racist?!

94
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,928
KELLOGG: It's just a temporary measure!

95
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:23,463
HORIZON DRONE 1: I didn't say anything.

96
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,797
KELLOGG: Hello, uh, miss?

97
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,432
This is Commander Kellogg.

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,769
I need you to move the locking
lever from "manual" to "auto".

99
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,805
PAM: "Auto," got it, moving the lever!

100
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,340
Uh... clunk.

101
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,207
Did that do it?

102
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,611
KELLOGG: Did you move the --?
PAM: Boring conversation anyway.

103
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,012
MALORY: What the hell are you doing?

104
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,616
PAM: These nutsacks wanna take
us to Mars to be baby-factories!

105
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,584
CHERYL/CAROL: Reeally...
MALORY: Wh-?

106
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,585
I can't go live on Mars!

107
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,487
I just rented a summer house!

108
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,022
PAM: Reeally...
MALORY: No.

109
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:55,627
PAM: You just -- oh whatever, c'mon,
we gotta figure a way out of this!

110
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,230
CHERYL/CAROL: Or do we...
ARCHER: Yes.

111
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:58,830
LANA: No!

112
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,466
And why is nobody else wearing a
t-shirt under their flight suit?

113
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,102
GILLETTE: Because this
thing feels amazing.

114
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,940
CYRIL: I know, right? Like a vagina with a zipper...
GILLETTE: Ew.

115
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,375
ARCHER: Lana, trust me,
this is the only way.

116
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,242
LANA: Ugh, alright.

117
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,210
But turn around.

118
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,178
ARCHER: "Turn around."

119
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,215
It's not like we haven't
all seen them before.

120
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,583
LANA: Don't remind me.

121
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,485
Okay, there.

122
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:23,023
ARCHER: Although, I guess it has been
a long time... LANA: Meaning...?

123
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:27,395
ARCHER: Nothing, just...
bet you're glad we're in reduced gravity.

124
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:28,229
LANA: [horrified gasp]

125
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:28,897
ARCHER: Well?

126
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,832
I didn't invent the ravages of time.

127
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,701
Okay Ray, Cyril, get ready.

128
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,470
Lana... pretend it's five years ago.

129
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,975
LANA: wish it was, so I could
murder you before we ever dated.

130
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,043
Uh, excuse me?

131
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,211
Could I borrow you?

132
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,980
HORIZON DRONE 2: No, you
cannot borroh oh my God!

133
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,383
LANA: Yeah, right?

134
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:50,887
HORIZON DRONE 2: Okay, what
seems to be the -- Oh my eye!

135
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,955
ARCHER: Somebody get his goddamn gun!

136
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:56,459
LANA: Oh for the love of--
ARCHER: Oww! Dick!

137
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,460
HORIZON DRONE 2: Gaargh!

138
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,261
My other eye!

139
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,197
I'm almost certainly blind...
ARCHER: Serves you right.

140
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,132
Anybody else hit?

141
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,034
GILLETTE: No, I'm good.
CYRIL: Yeah, me too.

142
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,835
ARCHER: That's because you hid Cyril.

143
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,405
Otherwise, I think that
all went pretty great.

144
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:09,039
Right?

145
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,140
LANA: Really.

146
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,074
ARCHER: (chuckling)

147
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:11,842
Do you not?

148
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,676
LANA: "Do you not?"

149
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:15,478
Just gimme the damn -- T-shirt.

150
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:16,946
ARCHER: Sorry, it's been commandeered.

151
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,814
NA: What the hell am I
supposed to wear?!

152
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:22,585
ARCHER: Uh... maybe this will work.

153
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:24,253
Ah, I think that totally works.

154
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:25,554
Stole them from the gift shop.

155
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:30,292
LANA: If you're done being an asshole,
help me strip this guy so I can --

156
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:32,461
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
Security breach, pod six.

157
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,529
ARCHER: We gotta move!

158
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:34,797
C'mon!

159
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,099
GILLETTE: Lana, let's go!

160
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:36,566
LANA: Wait!

161
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:40,169
Lemme just get -- damn it.

162
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:44,807
LANA: Rrrrr... owww!

163
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,243
Well now they're droopier.

164
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,078
HORIZON DRONE 2: Aww...

165
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,258
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
Security breach, pod six.

166
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,093
DRAKE: No no no, now what?!

167
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:56,762
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
Security breach, pod six.

168
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,662
DRAKE: I heard you!

169
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:01,900
I don't care if you have to use a
plasma torch, get this door open!

170
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,501
Security team, this is Commander Drake!

171
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,869
Converge on pod six!

172
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:06,871
KELLOGG: You heard him,
get this door open.

173
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,373
HORIZON DRONE 1: Sure thing... bossman.

174
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:13,444
KELLOGG: Oh my God, for the last time --
MALORY: We can't!

175
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:14,345
Fit them off!

176
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:18,882
PAM: That's what Dad said, when the bank
man came out to foreclose on the farm.

177
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,451
And guess how that turned out.

178
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,152
MALORY: You murdered a banker?!

179
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,088
PAM: No, we got a loan modification.

180
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:26,757
You think a bank wants to
own a failing dairy farm?

181
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,625
With obsolete milkers?

182
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:31,328
Oh my God, speaking of...
LANA: They're right!

183
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:33,431
Where they've always been!

184
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,499
MALORY: Wait, can she hear us?!

185
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,702
PAM: Man, I hope not...
MALORY: Lana?!

186
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:38,436
PAM: Guess not.

187
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:39,671
ARCHER: Will you come on?!

188
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,939
LANA: Rrgh!

189
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,474
PAM: Don't get me wrong,
I'd still do her.

190
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:46,045
MALORY: Oh please, you'd do...
name a noun.

191
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,513
LANA: No, you look!

192
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:50,349
You look at these, and tell
me they're not perfect!

193
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,618
ARCHER: Now?! Really?!

194
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:54,354
GILLETTE: Jesus God, are
you that insecure?!

195
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:55,522
LANA: No! I'm not!

196
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,659
Because I'm --
HORIZON DRONE 3: Readyyyyy!

197
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,927
ARCHER: Uh, thoughts?

198
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,762
LANA: Through there! Go!

199
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:03,897
ARCHER: Uh, newp.

200
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:05,131
HORIZON DRONE 3: Aaaiiim!

201
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,965
LANA: Why not?!

202
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,801
GILLETTE: It's full of,
ugh, garbage an' shit!

203
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,469
LANA: You got a better idea?!

204
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:13,039
ARCHER: Well, we could eat a big
bowl of Hepatitises A through E...

205
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:13,839
CYRIL: Or just run away.

206
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:17,176
LANA: Just because it was
my idea, you -- guys?!

207
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,978
HORIZON DRONE: Fiiiiire!

208
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:22,215
LANA: Oh shit.

209
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,983
KELLOGG: What is taking so long?!

210
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:26,920
HORIZON DRONE 1: Couple things...
One, I didn't invent whatever

211
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:31,257
this door is made of, which is apparently
some alloy of adamantium and mithril!

212
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:33,326
And two, not really liking your tone!

213
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,128
DRAKE: You idiots!

214
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:39,031
Firing an ion cannon at the
future Mother of Mars?

215
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,499
Whose idea was that?!

216
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,135
HORIZON DRONE 3: Dave's.
HORIZON DRONE 4 Wh-?!

217
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:45,438
DRAKE: Well that's great, Dave.

218
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:50,276
So tell me, if you kill her, who's
going to bear our Martian children?

219
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,111
Trish?!

220
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,112
HORIZON DRONE 3: Ew.

221
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,079
ARCHER: Ew!

222
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:53,847
LANA: Archer!

223
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:54,981
Sorry, go on, Trish.

224
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,486
TRISH: We've been locked in here ever
since they you idiots took over Horizon.

225
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:02,321
ARCHER: Tone...
LANA: Yeah, sorry.

226
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,058
Butt Drake wants to use the Intrepid
to push Horizon to Mars!

227
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,127
So tell us how we can stop him!

228
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:12,398
ARCHER: Yeah, can Cyril die after
shutting down the tractor beam, or...?

229
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:17,303
TRISH: Ugh! The Intrepid is the key to Drake's
plan, and he and Kellogg are the only

230
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,105
ones who can fly it!

231
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:22,675
So why aren't you a-holes down there?!

232
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,644
CYRIL: Burn. ARCHER: Cyril!

233
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:26,012
Although, good point Trish.

234
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,847
Okay, to the Intrepid!

235
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:31,416
Let's go!

236
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,251
LANA: Oh, and Trish?

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,655
With your looks, maybe
bitchy's not the way to go.

238
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,590
GILLETTE: Okay, you're the prettiest!

239
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,490
Come on!

240
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,092
DRAKE: I thought I made
myself very clear.

241
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,261
KELLOGG: You did, but--
DRAKE: Then why!

242
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,897
Isn't this airlock open?!

243
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:47,597
HORIZON DRONE 1:

244
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,898
Dwarven technology.

245
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,133
DRAKE: What was that?!

246
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:50,833
What'd you say?!

247
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:51,834
KELLOGG: Tony, stop!

248
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:52,235
PAM: See?

249
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:56,172
Now we just wait for Mr. Archer to
save the day, like he always does.

250
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,542
MALORY: I don't know about "always" but--
Are you sure they can't get in?

251
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,844
PAM: Didn't you hear him?

252
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:05,082
He said --
DRAKE: Say "dwarven technology" to me again!

253
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:05,882
PAM: What the...?

254
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,518
CHERYL/CAROL: Stop this at once!

255
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,253
We command you!

256
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:10,121
DRAKE: I'm sorry?

257
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,723
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh wait, we're
sorry -- aren't you guys

258
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,392
looking for a new Martian queen?

259
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:17,730
PAM: God damn it... DRAKE: Why, yes, and
you're -- CHERYL/CAROL: Your majesty.

260
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:23,101
DRAKE: Your majesty, and you are just, so...
What's the word I'm looking for?

261
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,537
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't say
whordiot, we hate that.

262
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,305
DRAKE: Majestic!
CHERYL/CAROL: Right?

263
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:32,143
Now follow me, we got a big list of
must-haves for the royal palace.

264
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,712
DRAKE: Uh, your wish is my command!

265
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,546
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh.

266
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,782
DRAKE: Seal the door behind me
and prepare Horizon for launch.

267
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,418
Next stop, Mars!

268
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:42,819
KELLOGG: Okay, you heard him.

269
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,421
HORIZON DRONE 1: Uh, I heard
him tell you to do it.

270
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,256
KELLOGG: And I'm telling you to do it!

271
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:49,693
HORIZON DRONE 1: And I'm telling you that I
didn't sign up for Animal Farm in space!

272
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,194
ARCHER: Wait, there's animals?

273
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,229
LANA: Wh-? No.

274
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:53,130
Animal Farm?

275
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,932
CYRIL: How do you not get that?

276
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:58,436
ARCHER: Cyril, I know what an animal farm is --
CYRIL: Not an animal farm!

277
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:01,172
ARCHER: -- and maybe we can, I dunno,
stampede a flock of goats down

278
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,775
the hall...
LANA: Animal Farm! Is a book!

279
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,177
ARCHER: No, it isn't Lana!

280
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:07,045
It's an allegorical novella!

281
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,347
About Stalinism!

282
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,582
By George Orwell!

283
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,685
And spoiler alert, it sucks!

284
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:17,255
Although I was talking about
an actual animal farm.

285
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,690
So never mind.

286
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,729
DRAKE: Oh don't mind me, ma'am, just uh...
adjusting the climate control.

287
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:25,663
CHERYL/CAROL: Ooh! Yes!

288
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,498
Another palace must-have!

289
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,368
Now, we heard some mention of babies?

290
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:34,405
DRAKE: Uh-huh...
CHERYL/CAROL: But just to be clear, we don't do babies?

291
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:35,873
DRAKE: "Do" as in...?

292
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,008
CHERYL/CAROL: "Do" as in
tolerate, be around, touch,

293
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,411
and definitely as in let them claw
their monstery way out of our vagina.

294
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,347
DRAKE: Well, let's put a pin in that.

295
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:44,915
CHERYL/CAROL: Eww!

296
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,350
Wait, put a pin in what?

297
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,150
DRAKE: What?

298
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,452
What is wrong with you?!

299
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,088
And where are the other two --
PAM: Right here, spacenuts.

300
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,523
CHERYL/CAROL: Pamela, stop!

301
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,690
Your queen commands you!

302
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,193
MALORY: Oh please, you're not fit
to be queen of... name a place.

303
00:11:58,262 --> 00:11:59,061
CHERYL/CAROL: Lidsville.

304
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,898
MALORY: And Drake, you can forget
all about your crazy little...

305
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,567
Martian sex-cult!

306
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:08,071
DRAKE: It's not -- don't
you people get it?!

307
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,872
Earth is doomed!

308
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:14,944
Mankind's only hope for survival
is to find a new home on Mars,

309
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:18,181
and I'm the only man alive
who can lead us there!

310
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,352
I'm like, like --
MALORY: Oh, Jesus Christ... DRAKE: Well,

311
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,688
I think a more apt analogy would be Moses, but --
KELLOGG: Drop your weapon!

312
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:26,322
PAM: Make me!

313
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,725
ARCHER: No, don't make her, c'mon...
Pam?!

314
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,526
MALORY: Pam, shoot.
ARCHER: Mother!

315
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,327
LANA: Malory!

316
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:31,828
MALORY: Pam.

317
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,063
And she'll do it, too...
CHERYL/CAROL: She'll do anything

318
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:37,500
to keep us from the throne
which is our birthright!

319
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,337
Ew, birth.

320
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:42,371
KELLOGG: Alright!

321
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,306
DRAKE: Wh-? No no no!
What're you doing?!

322
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,207
DRAKE: No, no!

323
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:50,312
Even if they kill me, they
can never kill our dream!

324
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,316
Mars --
ARCHER: Hang on, sorry, one sec.

325
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,319
Drones? You wanna...?

326
00:12:56,387 --> 00:13:00,456
Thank you, thank you, thanks a lot.

327
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:02,859
KELLOGG: There is no
Mars without you, Tony.

328
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:03,927
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:05,929
DRAKE: Sorry?!

330
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,197
You're sorry?!

331
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:11,068
You just singlehandedly doomed mankind!

332
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:14,472
ARCHER: Hey, even so, black astronaut,
that's still pretty huge.

333
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,239
LANA: It actually is.

334
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:18,810
ARCHER: And at least your own mother
didn't just play chicken with your life!

335
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,911
CYRIL: Self-burn.

336
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,345
ARCHER: Cyril! Okay, Drake.

337
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,349
You are going to fly us back to
Earth, to stand trial for...

338
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,951
whatever, space-piracy.

339
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,487
DRAKE: No man can judge me.

340
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:33,092
ARCHER: Well, you say that...
DRAKE: Mars foreverrrrrr!

341
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:33,993
CHERYL/CAROL: Aaaaaaaaghhhh!

342
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:41,501
CYRIL: Suppressing fiiiiiiire!

343
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:42,935
CYRIL: I think I got 'em!

344
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:43,669
Did I get 'em?!

345
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:44,237
LANA: You did.

346
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,240
You got those two guys, who were
just minding their own business...

347
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:51,544
Ooh! And also the one remaining person
who could fly us back to Earth!

348
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,546
ARCHER: A black astronaut, Cyril!

349
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,381
That's like killing a unicorn!

350
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,983
PAM: Aw, crapsnacks!

351
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,452
How could this get --
ARCHER: Don't! Say it!

352
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,154
Do not say it!

353
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:09,329
BARRY: Gone to outer spaaaace, to
shoot that dickbag in his faaaace!

354
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,197
BARRY: Hang on, Other Barry.

355
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,198
This is Barry.

356
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,733
Hey, punkin pie!

357
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:15,368
I -- whatsat?

358
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:20,307
No, I'm in... London, for -- whaaat?

359
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:25,279
Katya, punkin, I promised I'd
stop trying to kill Archer.

360
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:28,615
Yes, both Barrys promised!

361
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:34,254
What? Wait, what's wrong with the
sofa we already -- ooh, hey, hon?

362
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,123
You're breaking up.

363
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:41,127
Doo doo doo doo dooooo...
PAM: Any worse.

364
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,762
Is what I was gonna say.

365
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:44,932
ARCHER: Really?

366
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,600
PAM: Yes.

367
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:54,164
ARCHER: Oh my God, are
you kidding me?!

368
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:54,865
Brrring!

369
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,599
Hello, is this airboats?

370
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:59,302
Yeah hi, it's me, Spacebot.

371
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,303
What?

372
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:04,606
Oh, just lifting a thousand pounds
like it's an apple, no big deal...

373
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:05,307
LANA: Archer!

374
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,577
Quit screwing around with the robot
and shut the damn airlock already!

375
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,311
ARCHER: Five more minutes!

376
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,613
God...
MALORY: What's the hurry?

377
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:17,552
We're all going to die up here anyway...
CHERYL/CAROL: We're gonna diiiiiie!

378
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:18,687
GILLETTE: We're not gonna die!

379
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,056
Stop crying!

380
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,226
And for what it's worth, I think you
would've made a great Martian queen.

381
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,028
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh!

382
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,031
GILLETTE: Okay...
LANA: Uh, so Trish?

383
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,765
TRISH: What.

384
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:32,569
LANA: Still with the tone...
ARCHER: Okay, the airlock's closed! Happy?!

385
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:33,903
LANA: So, seriously?

386
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,738
None of you guys know
how to fly this thing?

387
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,206
TRISH: No! We're scientists!

388
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,675
We never even trained on the simulator!

389
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:41,177
CYRIL: The simulator!

390
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,646
Guys, I can fly us home!

391
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:44,813
I will fly us home!

392
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:47,549
ARCHER: Wait, what is this?!

393
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:48,650
And that?!

394
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,885
But right now this?!

395
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:53,221
LANA: He was really good in the simulator...
ARCHER: Yeah, right up until he crashed it!

396
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,190
CYRIL: Thanks to you and your
stupid fire extinguisher!

397
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:58,259
ARCHER: Right?
LANA: Okay, then it's settled.

398
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:01,596
So Trish, Horizon is
self-sustaining, right?

399
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,432
TRISH: Duh.
LANA: Well then have fun.

400
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,000
ARCHER: Wait wait wait!

401
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:10,373
Nevermind, I'm sure somebody's
gonna feed the farm animals.

402
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:13,109
LANA: Cyril, you're in
command, try not to kill us.

403
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:14,811
Everybody else, strap in.

404
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,446
PAM: Reeeally...
LANA: I said in!

405
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:18,347
Not on!

406
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,181
PAM: Oh.

407
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,982
LANA: And ew.

408
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,884
And -- Malory.

409
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:24,486
MALORY: I'm going into stasis.

410
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:28,523
Wake me up when we're on the ground.

411
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,492
Preferably above seventy-second street.

412
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,859
[ BOTTLES CLINKING ]

413
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,995
ARCHER: What is that, who's got beer?

414
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,597
BARRY: Arrcherrr!

415
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:36,197
ARCHER: Wh-?

416
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,632
BARRY: Come out to plaay-yaaay!

417
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:39,633
EVERYBODY: Barry?!

418
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,968
BARRY: C'mon out, Archer!

419
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:45,473
I'd come in, but...
Who built this door, space-dwarves?

420
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,374
ARCHER: Okay, Barry!

421
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:52,080
Forgetting, for the moment,
how you found me here...!

422
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,748
You wanna finish this?!

423
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,016
BARRY: I do, yeah.

424
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:56,317
That's why I'm here.

425
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:57,886
ARCHER: Not for long, you're not!

426
00:16:57,988 --> 00:16:59,421
LANA: Where do you
think you're going?!

427
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,857
ARCHER: Uh, this place
called to kill Barry?

428
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,892
GILLETTE: Are you -- every time
y'all fight he beats you like

429
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,228
the redheaded stepchild
of a rented mule!

430
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:08,764
ARCHER: No he doesn't.

431
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,600
EVERYBODY: yes, yes he does.

432
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,267
BARRY: No no, wait!

433
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:13,502
Look look look!

434
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:15,938
Hang on!

435
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:20,476
Here, look, check it out!

436
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:21,844
You can wear this!

437
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:23,880
ARCHER: Oh my God...
BARRY: Right?

438
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,317
Evil cyborg versus Spacebot. Love it.

439
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:32,290
ARCHER: This is gonna be -- and I hate
this word, but -- this is gonna be epic!

440
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,325
Hang on I'll be right --
LANA: He can't get in here.

441
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,427
So the only reason to go
out there, is your ego.

442
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:38,662
ARCHER: Not just my ego, Lana!

443
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:40,297
Spacebot's ego!

444
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,432
GILLETTE: And a giant ass-whippin...
ARCHER: I can take him!

445
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,102
MALORY: Please!
We just want to go home!

446
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,906
ARCHER: But, Spacebot...
CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus, think about somebody else for

447
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,708
once in your life!

448
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,276
LANA: And that's her saying that.

449
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,678
CHERYL/CAROL: Exactly.

450
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:59,082
BARRY: Domo arigato, Archer Robot-o...
ARCHER: Uh, Barry?

451
00:17:59,151 --> 00:17:59,816
BARRY: Yo!

452
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,017
Let's get it on, brotha!

453
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:04,153
ARCHER: I, uh... can't.

454
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,088
Get it on.

455
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,323
BARRY: What?!
ARCHER: Maybe next time, sorry.

456
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:11,260
BARRY: Hey, don't do that, don't apologize...
I mean, if you're having

457
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:16,065
a legitimate problem with your vagina...
that you have between your legs

458
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:19,969
in lieu a penis, I completely understand
and you need to deal with that.

459
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,105
Honestly, we can do this again.

460
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:28,011
ARCHER: Grrrggrrk...
LANA: Archer?

461
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,846
