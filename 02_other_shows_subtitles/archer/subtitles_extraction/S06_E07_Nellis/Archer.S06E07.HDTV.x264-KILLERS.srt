Hello?

00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,956
<i>[Archer] Carol, hey, shut up.
I need your help.</i>

<i>Wait, Pam? Is that you?</i>

00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,163
- Yes. - <i> Great, shut up, because</i>

let me guess. You're all butt-hurt

13
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,802
because Lana hired some
Pakistani dude to shoot you,

14
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,738
so you went to Vegas, and now you're
drunk and broke outside a casino,

15
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:48,740
and you want me to wire
a thousand dollars

16
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,177
to buy you a plane ticket
and a pre-flight whore.

No. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
C'mon, I really need your help.

Okay, where do I send the--

[Chuckling]
Hang on! Make him beg!

23

<i>Pam, goddamn it, I said shut up!</i>

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,966
You shut up! Jesus, I'm sending you the
money for your stupid plane ticket!

25
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>Which would be great...</i>

Uh...

29
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,944
[Grunting, straining]
Help! Get it off!

30
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:29,047
[Grunts] I wanna fly the plane!

31
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:32,016
You know, who knows? It's the government.
That's not important--

32
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,919
What is important
is getting me home.

33
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:38,123
Ugh, fine, then I'll send money
for a stupid train ticket.

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,992

Wow, I had no idea there
was a "no-train" list.

<i>Well, neither did I,</i>

40

you ask, the answer is no, Carol.

41
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,373
A thousand times no.

42

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,803
Oh, thank you!
Thank you, God!

Yeah, even me, and I didn't even know
they made shoes out of cornbread.

Oh, so you believe
the United States government

00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,777

dick around with the air force.

00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:30,956
Hello dear, drink?
Uh, no?

153
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,676
Well, you're not missing much.

154
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,080
No ice.
Not a cube.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,514
And I can't wait to hear
her flimsy excuse this time.

156
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,462
<i>[Soldiers] Get out the plane!
Put your hands up!</i>

157
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,619
Get out of the plane now!
Let's go, let's move!

158
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,621
[Moans and groans]

159
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,758
Wow, those guys
look... furious.

160
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,460
Yeah, no shit!
So thank you, Ray!

161
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:53,562
For what, safely
landing the plane?

162
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,941
What, like that cancels out getting
it shot down in the first place?

163
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,023
You were the one yapping your damn
head off about my damn teacup pig!

164
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,141
Who I hope to see
on my next BLT!

165
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,978
Well too bad, because he...
went to... live on a...

166
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,980
A farm! Exactly!

167
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,897
So unless that farm had
a magical talking spider--

168
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,084
[huge gasp]

169
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,954
Yeah, they don't keep 'em
around for their milk.

170
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:16,982
And I don't know that we're accomplishing
as much as we could be right now.

171
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,291
[Banging, rattling]

172
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,128
Hmm. How about now?

173
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,130
Oh my God, I bet it's nerve gas!

174
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:26,233
Just like they sprayed on Duddy Kravitz
in "Close Encounters"!

175
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,236
Wait, what?
It's not nerve gas, you idiots, it's--

176
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,972
You think the CIA's
above nerve gas?

177
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,942
I-- holy shit, that's right, it's the CIA!
I've got Q-clearance!

178
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,145
Wait, what?
What does that even mean?

179
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,980
It means get naked.

180
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,282
C'mon, let's go.
Gun's out, buns out.

181
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,418
Don't shoot!
Hands up, everybody!

182
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:46,253
[Archer]
We're coming out! Don't shoot!

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,022
[Cursing and muttering]

184
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,257
[Archer] Do not shoot!

185
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,059
Guys, it's okay, I--

186
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,260
He's got a weapon!
He's got a weapon! Gun!

187
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,162
Q-clearance!
I've got Q-clearance!

188
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,130
Seriously, is that
even a real thing?

189
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,594
[Colonel] Q-clearance?
We'll see about that.

190
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,234
What's your
authentication phrase?

191
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:05,972
Sweet dash forty-four, tender dash
nine, hot dash juicy pork chops!

192
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,974
I didn't pick it.

193
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:11,737
Authentication checks out, sir.
Says here he's Agent Slater.

194
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:14,014
Hmph! Well, Agent Slater!

195
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,248
What? Who?
Agent Slater.

196
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,918
Shut up.
How'd you get Slater's codeword?

197
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:21,636
You mind telling me why in God's
green dick you were in my airspace?

198
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,625
Well, our airspace,
for starters, right?

199
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,261
Since I have
CIA clearance and all.

200
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:30,364
And not that it's any of
your business, lieutenant...

201
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:34,368
Colonel. Lieutenant Colonel, but
during transport of these prisoners--

202
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:36,437
black site, pretty icky stuff.

203
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:40,607
They attempted to overpower me, forcing
my pilot to make an emergency landing,

204
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:44,611
but before he could radio your tower
for permission to land, boom!

205
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,480
And then-- well,
you know the rest.

206
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,815
Is this true?

207
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:51,385
Uh--
He's Israeli! So, just Hebrew. Unless...

208
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:52,856
<i>Reds Yiddish? Nisht?</i>

209
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,655
So no, just Hebrew.

210
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,623
Then how was he gonna
radio the tower?

211
00:09:56,691 --> 00:10:01,105
Which, I mean-- yeah, exactly, and
if I spoke Hebrew I would ask him.

212
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,465
- Well-- - R-right after I ask your
wife and kids about you,

213
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,700
but they don't know, they
haven't seen you in a year.

214
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,469
They think you ran off
with a stripper,

215
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,637
when in reality you are
literally climbing the walls

216
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:14,508
of a farmhouse in Virginia
somewhere, out of your mind on LSD,

Jesus Christ...

218

So while you're finding me
a new airplane, Air Force guy,

219
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:23,818
we're gonna need some sort
of shuttle to...

220
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,677
I assume you have an officer's club?
Yep.

221
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:30,283
Jeeps! Gimme two jeeps up here, on the
double! Jeeps, goddamn it, jeeps!

[Lana] I'm sorry?

224
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,880
You're sure you
don't want a drink?

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,898
Yeah, in the...
low nineties on that.

226
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:42,214
Suit yourself. So. And how
is our little Abbiejean?

227
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,904
Oh, yeah she's good,
great actually,

228
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,574
and I'm really liking her nanny.

229
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,075
Mm. Hispanic?

230
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,396
[Sighs] She's actually Polish.

231
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,034
Is that supposed to be better?

232
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,615
What? No. They're both--

233
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:57,584
Abbiejean. That's
from where, again?

234
00:10:57,652 --> 00:10:59,753
Again, it was
my grandmother's name.

235
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:03,281
Hmm. You know what I think
would be wonderful?

236
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:07,248
A border moat?
...Is if she had her grandmother's name.

237
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:11,139
Well yeah, and obviously I talked
to my mother of god, you mean you.

238
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:12,910
Thoughts?

239
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,218
Because they don't have my brands, I
don't even recognize most of these.

240
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:19,373
Well, maybe instead of worrying
about what cocktails to make--

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,709
That's what I'm saying, Cyril. I don't
even know if I can make cocktails!

What the hell's the air force spending
all those kajillions of dollars on?

O'Dublin tequila?
I mean vodka, maybe.

244
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,684
They obviously know their
way around a potato, but--

245
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,883
My point... is maybe you should worry
about what's gonna happen to us

246
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,854
when they find out
you're not Slater!

247
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:38,156
Cyril, I should worry
about all kinds of shit.

248
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:40,561
But you know what
they say about stress.

can afford it and--

304
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,170
I'm not selling you
the naming rights, Malory!

305
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,172
She's not a frickin' bowl game!

306
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:19,415
[Crying hysterically]
Oh... now...

307
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,797
[Sighs] I mean, if it
means that much to you--

308
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:32,557
I guess maybe Malory
could be her... middle name?

309
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:37,228
Really?
Yes.

310
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:40,650
Well, obviously that's not worth a
hundred thousand dollars, but--

311
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,133
Fifty?
Pff!

312
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,171
22.5, and I want a notarized copy
of the revised birth certificate

313
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:48,273
on my desk by Friday.

314
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,542
I--
Oh, and christen her in a white church,

315
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:55,380
and I'll kick in five more.
Wow.

316
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:59,450
Real life E.T.'s! My God, I hope we
find them. I have so many questions!

317
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,749
Pff, like what, how to
build a better anal probe?

318
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,684
Right? I bet their anal technology
is light-years ahead of mine.

319
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:08,520
A light-year's
a unit of length, dipshit.

320
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,522
Well, whatever then...
Parsecs.

321
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,458
Length.
I-- hey ya know what?

322
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,261
[Chuckling] I know how far light
travels in vacuum in a Julian year.

323
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:17,629
[Alien] Ooooh!

324
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,332
Very good, Pamela.

325
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,603
I, that, my, I--
you know my name?

326
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,573
Yes, Pamela.
And yours, Algernop.

327
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,342
But, but, but-but
but-but-- English?

328
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, head. Head.

329
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,674
Pam! I think
he means telepathy.

330
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,932
Holy shit, like in scanners?

331
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,040
[Krieger, aliens] No.

332
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,103
No no no, wait!
I have Q-clearance!

333
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,863
Bullshit. Firing in three! Two!

334
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,390
No! Stop it! Look, I'm serious.
Just radio Lieutenant Colonel.

335
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,030
He can straighten
this whole thing out!

336
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,995
Lieutenant Colonel who?
What?

337
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,839
Lieutenant Colonel who.

338
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:58,603
Oh, my God!

339
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:02,295
[Chuckling] Wow, all right,
this is pretty embarrassing.

340
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,714
I thought that guy
was a lieutenant,

341
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:06,957
and that his
last name was Colonel.

342
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,252
In three! Two!
Wait!

343
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:13,073
Goddamn it, look, I was just
trying to get home from Vegas.

344
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:17,342
[Sighs] So okay, here,
you can have my weapon.

345
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:19,089
But I do have some conditions.

346
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,963
Uh, what conditions?

347
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,599
Well... you're
not gonna like 'em.

348
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,935
[Yelling, grunting]

349
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,982
[Out of breath] Whew!

350
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,658
And not to knock
the air force, but...

351
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:44,214
[Chuckling] good thing you guys
have airplanes.

352
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:46,272
I got a cousin in the Air Force.

353
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,783
Brian. I should give him a call.

354
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,070
Should we, uh...

355
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,911
Guys, I really feel like
we should be doing something.

356
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,380
[Carol] Ugh, we are...
[Gillette] C'mon, nothing by the drifters?

357
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,084
The tams? The dominoes?
The embers? They call this "Classic Rock."

358
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:03,053
Pff, what is this, Myrtle Beach?

359
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:06,223
Ray. Is this Myrtle Beach?
No.

360
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,060
[Both crying]
And that, my dear earthlings,

361
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:14,098
is the key to understanding
the entire universe.

362
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,201
Well, at least
as we understand it.

363
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,969
Yes.

364
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:23,941
[Choking sobs]
[Stuttering] Ta-take us... with you!

365
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,243
[Archer] I will, if you shut up!

366
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,283
[Babbling]

367
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,185
What the hell, Krieger, did you
shove your dick in a socket?

368
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:38,222
[Stuttering]
Did-did-- ow!

369
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,391
Krieger, I am in no mood.
Now, get dressed.

370
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,326
[Carol] Ugh, seriously?

371
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,396
Yes, seriously. We're gonna
walk out of this building,

372
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:48,432
into a hangar, and steal
an Air Force plane!

373
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,928
And while we're doing that, I could do
with a whole lot less shit from you,

374
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,364
Since all I wanted was a ride home!

375
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:58,001
On my private jet.
Wh--? Yes!

376
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:00,937
Can, can-can we talk for a second?
About what happened?

377
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:05,108
Uh, is that before or after Krieger
sexually assaulted a two-twenty outlet?

378
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,110
[Laughing] "Area 51".

379
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,946
No! You guys!
I swear, they were--

380
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,948
Pam! Seriously, get
your shit together.

381
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:15,085
We have to go steal a plane from
the United States Air Force.

382
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,087
[Motors droning]

383
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,288
<i>Which...</i>

384
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,924
not as hard
as I would've thought.

385
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:22,359
Ray! <i> Wie geht's?</i>

386
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,961
<i>Pff, darf min gehn in kolledj?</i>

387
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:29,199
Yeah? You guys good?
If you want a drink, just-- wh--?

388
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,732
Because it's just
de-icing fluid and Tang.

389
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:35,005
Tell me!
Tell me you saw them!

390
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:39,209
I-- Pam, I saw a blinding
white flash, that's it. No E.T., no Alf...

391
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:42,012
B-but you believe me,
don't you?

392
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,006
You believe
I'm telling the truth!

393
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:48,985
Pam, the truth is out there.

394
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,354
[Gasp] So you do believe me?

395
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,958
[Laughing]
No! You stupid idiot!

396
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,803
Alrighty then! I think I'm
sufficiently drunk enough, so...

397
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,981
so who's up for Branson?

398
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:03,316
<i>(Voices cheering)</i> [Carol] Realsies, realsies?
<i>Yeah!</i>

399
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:06,190
<i>[Archer]</i>
<i>This thing have bombs on it?</i>

400
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:19,727
