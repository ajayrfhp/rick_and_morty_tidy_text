00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,834
...Toast.

162
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,904
[sighs]
you ruined it.

163
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,076
Agh, son of a--

164
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,879
God, is one last
non-malarial hurrah

165
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,847
Before I go home
too much to ask?

166
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,883
Agh, thanks jungle.

167
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,918
Eat a buffet of dicks.

168
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,387
Okay, the plane should be
just about a half click

169
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,655
Down this trail, and--

170
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,756
[man screaming]

171
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,824
[startled yelp]

172
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,340
Stop!

173
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,876
Stop! Jesus, kato,
will you stop?

174
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,378
I mean, is this
a mugging, or...?

175
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,579
You are american.

176
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,347
Hey, english, good.

177
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,116
Yes, I'm american.

178
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,617
Then we are at war!

179
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,553
We... We as in who,
exactly?

180
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,089
America,
and the empire of japan.

181
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,091
The-- wait a minute,
do you mean, like,

182
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,694
Cool honda scrambler japan,
or--

183
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,363
Super uncool
pearl harbor japan?

184
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,564
What?

185
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,866
How long have you
been on this island?

186
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,901
Since the tenth of may...

187
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,403
1942.

188
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,704
Oh, boy.

189
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,873
Uh, well, kato--

190
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,041
Sato!

191
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,610
First lieutenant sato kentaro.

192
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,813
Well ken,
I've got some bad news.

193
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,617
Oh, and also
some worse news.

194
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,491
Liar.
Why would I lie
about the war being over?

195
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,127
Since 1945, I might add.

196
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,896
To trick me
into surrendering

197
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,965
Um...
I do not surrender,

198
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,667
Nor consent
to be your prisoner,

199
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,969
So just kill me.

200
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,136
What? No.

201
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,172
Ken, will you relax

202
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,807
Or is your entire generation

203
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,809
Physically incapable
of doing that?

204
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,311
How can I relax
while we are at war?

205
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,147
We're not!
Here, shut up, look.

206
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,817
Here's you guys
signing the surrender
on the uss missouri.

207
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,785
Here's all the vj day
parades in america.

208
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,321
Here's  <i>the bad news bears</i>
<i>go to japan.</i>

209
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,657
That's lupus and tanner.

210
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,758
Oh, and here's a link
to an episode

211
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,326
Of  <i>the six million man</i>

212
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,662
About this exact thing
we're doing right now.

213
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,330
The six million who?

214
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,966
Oh, god, you've got
so much to catch up on.

215
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,534
Okay, so there's this guy,
steve austin,

216
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,003
And he was an astronaut,

217
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,338
But-- damn, wait. Okay.
So, an astronaut--

218
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,341
What is this thing?
This device?

219
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,478
It's a telephone, kinda,
that talks to outer space,

220
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,279
And also-- shit!

221
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,815
What?
I'm supposed to go find
a computer.

222
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,117
[chuckling]
here?

223
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,852
There are no building
in the jungle

224
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,054
Big enough to hold a computer!

225
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,489
No,
they're really small, now.

226
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,624
I think you guys
actually did that.

227
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,359
Anyway, I need to go
get one out of a plane

228
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,894
That crashed near here, so...

229
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,330
Yes, I know where
this airplane is.

230
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,865
Duh. Me, too.

231
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,701
So, if I just kinda leave,
are you gonna be cool,

232
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,570
Or try to sneak up on me
and slit my throat?

233
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,074
[sighs]
well, I hope you're happy...

234
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,343
Because I feel like
a total dick.

235
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,245
And also kinda racist.

236
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,781
And I resent you making me
feel like that, so...

237
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,517
[scoffs]

238
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,419
I'm not a racist.

239
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,589
I just wanted it
to be all white.

240
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,758
Jeezy petes,
this drawer squeaks

241
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,827
Exactly like the old one did!

242
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,095
And is this...

243
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,563
Is this brett's blood?

244
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,366
Ugh, no,
just the same type.

245
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,334
We had to fudge it
a little on the stains,

246
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,070
Some of which
actually were fudge.

247
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,172
And some of which
merely resembled it.

248
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,840
[sobs]

249
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,443
But why would
you do this?

250
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,578
[snickers]

251
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,547
Okay, it should be
right up here,

252
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,282
And if you try
any funny stuff--

253
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,350
Please, be more quiet.

254
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,053
Many enemy soldiers
patrol the jungle.

255
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,457
Guerillas, I think,
chinese and malays.

256
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,859
Oh, that must be the insurgency
they were talking about,

257
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,227
The communists.

258
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,963
They are communists?
So, america's allies?

259
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,266
What? No.
Communists hate america.

260
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,069
No, american
and russian and chinese

261
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,904
Are fighting together
for communism.

262
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,739
No, against fascism!
And that was--

263
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,807
[startled yelp]

264
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,777
Ow!

265
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,312
[sucks teeth]
ouch.

266
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,614
Ya think?!
Ya think ouch, do ya?

267
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,282
[shouting in foreign language]

268
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,450
The guerillas!

269
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,219
They will kill me,
let me go!

270
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,589
They'll kill me!
Pull me up, or I will kill you!

271
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,556
[guerillas approaching]

272
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,891
[sato mutters]

273
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,327
At least give me the gun.

274
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,795
I'll give you the bullets!

275
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,164
You would rather
we both die?!

276
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,467
I'm honestly
kind of on the fence!

277
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,103
[archer groans]

278
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,104
Oh, shut up.

279
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,772
[offended]
hey.

280
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,943
[cheryl]
and here's your office,
ms. Archer...

281
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,580
[malory sobs]

282
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,682
And if the rest of you
will follow me,

283
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,418
We've still got
a lot to cover.

284
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,621
[lana]
but it's all just
the same as it was.

285
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,289
Exactly.
That's the whole point.

286
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,590
But it almost would've
been cheaper

287
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,359
To build a time machine
and go back

288
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,294
To before the office
got blown up.

289
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,496
[gasps]
we looked into that!

290
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,465
But that technology
doesn't exist!

291
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,866
I'll catch up, I gotta
run in here real quick

292
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,768
And grab some urinal cakes.

293
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,504
Why the hell do you
need urinal cakes?

294
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,839
For my shower at home.

295
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,374
Oh, lord.
Gross.

296
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,286
Ms. Archer looks like a mule
kicked her in the face.

297
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,555
How's the water?

298
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,791
Sweet baby james,
it is perfect.

299
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,359
Um... Uh...

300
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,694
Pam.
Pam.

301
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,130
Yes, of course,
I know you're--

302
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,233
So I gained the weight back.
Sue me.

303
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,367
No, I was--

304
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,802
Look, my therapist says

305
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,804
Everybody's got a hole
that needs to be filled.

306
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,339
Some people
fill it with drugs,

307
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,707
Some fill it with work,

308
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,409
Some fill it with
between-meal snacks

309
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,311
And liquor
and their therapist's cock.

310
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:57,048
Um, I was actually
looking at your pubic hair.

311
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,050
Oh, yeah.
It's a lightning bolt,

312
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,219
But I guess the letters
could use a touch-up.

313
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,154
It's supposed to say "tcb."

314
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,523
"takin' care of beaveness."

315
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,724
Super.

316
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,192
Kampai.

317
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,327
[archer and sato]
kampai.

318
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,763
Is that medicine?

319
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,066
Painkillers.
Mixed with candy.

320
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,567
I call 'em "mike and vikes."

321
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,035

00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,088
You archer?

482
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,456
Duh!

483
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,358
So, ready to go home?

484
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,793
I think no.

485
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,629
I have been gone far too long.

486
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,799
My family, even if
they are still alive,

487
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,735
Surely by now
they have moved on.

488
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,304
Uh-huh.
It would not
be fair to them,

489
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,207
If I were to return
after so many years.

490
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,976
Yeah, return to, uh...

491
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,145
Where did you and hatsumi
and keiko used to live?

492
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,448
Hm? Oh, takamori.

493
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,617
A very small town,
in nagano prefecture, but--

494

495

00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,225
Hatsumi?

498
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,228
Sato hatsumi?
<i>Hai.</i>

499
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,998
Hatsumi...

[hatsumai sobbing]
<i>kentaro-san?</i>

00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,837

[man]
hey, there's
this new thing we have

505
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,718
Called a schedule.

506
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,323
We need a minute!

507
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,658
Captain shit-nuts!

508
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,260
Tell her I said hi.

509
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,295
[lana]
nope.

510
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,198
No, no, huh-uh, no.

511
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,100
You don't disappear
for six weeks,

512
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,102
And then just waltz
in here like you never left,

513
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,537
And casually say, "hi"!

514
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,040
First of all, lana,
I didn't waltz in here,

515
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,609
Not with nine broken ribs,
a punctured lung,

516
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,611
Severe penetration trauma
to my foot,

517
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,347
And poop-related septicemia!

518
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,049
And also crabs.
[both] ugh!

519
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,051
I assume from the jungle.

520
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,285
Oh please, if--

521
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,120
Not to mention
that stupid computer,

522
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,522
Which is why you're upset,

523
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,691
I mean jealous,
because I aced the mission!

524
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,725
What?

525
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,493
And you did
blow up the plane?

526
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,629
The plane blew up!
Yes! I don't--

527
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,797
Jealous?

528
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,231
[crying]
oh, shut up.

529
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,533
[both]
hey!

530
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,201
I'm not jealous
about the mission.

531
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,370
I'm upset because no one
knew where you were.

532
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,506
And if, huge if,
you're gonna be involved,

533
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,409
Oh my god, in any sort
of parental role for abbiejean.

534
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,579
No, yeah, and I, ya know,
I want to.

535
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,015
But are we married
to abbiejean, or...?

536
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,550
Believe me, I tried.

537
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,552
Zip it, gee-baw!
[gasps]

538
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,021
No! I will not
be called gee-baw.

539
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,090
It's grandmother archer
or nothing!

540
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,357
Then hush.

541
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,726
Because we,
you and I,

542
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,761
Are gonna have to
establish some ground rules.

543
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,496
Lana, they're just
gonna get broken.

544
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,731
[weary sigh]

545
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,265
I am now going
to feed our child.

546
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,034
If you'd like to talk
while I do so,

547
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,235
Follow me.

548
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,672
I would!
I would love to talk, lana.

549
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,073
Just don't wanna
have to listen.

550
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,408
[weary sigh]

551
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,911
And how about
this renovation, huh?

552
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,346
I can't believe
they pulled it off.

553
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,415
What?
You knew about this?!

554
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,183
Yeah, I was on
the planning committee.

555
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm not a huge fan of change.

556
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,387
[archer laughs]

557
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,057
Except for you, milton!

558
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,525
