00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,563
ISIS accounts, we're broke.

176
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,698
MALORY: Hopefully not for long.

177
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,999
And when that drug money

178
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,100
starts pouring in,

179
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,001
you'll be in charge of

180
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,170
laundering.

181
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:40,770
CYRIL: I'll start looking

182
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:41,671
for a laundromat.

183
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:42,339
MALORY: Wh-?

184
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,342
Money laundering, you ass!

185
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:46,910
Oh, you mean as a front,

186
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,877
because a laundromat

187
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,780
is a cash-based business.

188
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:52,249
Why don't I just leave that

189
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,216
whole side of the organization

190
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,517
to you?

191
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,885
CYRIL: Only if you promise

192
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:57,721
to periodically micromanage it.

193
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,289
And emasculate me.

194
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,457
MALORY: Cyril,

195
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,291
I would have thought

196
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:04,394
that goes without saying.

197
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,195
ARCHER: Ugh!

198
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,763
It smells like a skunk ape!

199
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,597
LANA: Yeah,

200
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,298
I'm hoping the mattresses

201
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,799
are just mildewy, and not...

202
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,202
Mildewy and dead-hookery.

203
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,103
ARCHER: No, not the room.

204
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:13,937
These.

205
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,238
PAM: Casts smell bad when

206
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,374
thing people know about!

207
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,441
ARCHER: Yeah after six weeks,

208
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,876
not six hours!

209
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:21,211
LANA: So listen,

210
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:21,978
about this deal...

211
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,746
ARCHER: Hang on.

212
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:25,448
Pam, chop chop, torso!

213
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,417
Ugh, this smells like a kennel,

214
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,085
but for dogs that are poor.

215
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:29,719
LANA: Archer!

216
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,654
ARCHER: What, smell it.

217
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:31,888
LANA: Shut up, look

218
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,922
your mother's got the time

219
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,224
in here, the place,

220
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:34,991
price per kilo...

221
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:35,992
But there's nothing

222
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,060
about her contact,

223
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:37,661
no picture,

224
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,762
not even a name?

225
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,096
What if this "person" is

226
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,431
really a biker gang?

227
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,132
ARCHER: Who gives a shit?

228
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,066
Hang on.

229
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,134
Legs!

230
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,468
Lana, you and I, more me,

231
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,770
were two of the best

232
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:47,671
secret agents in the

233
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:48,405
world...

234
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,272
LANA: We were rogues.

235
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,073
ARCHER: Potato, puh-treason,

236
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:51,107
whatever, but we've been

237
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,575
up against terrorists,

238
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,177
assassins, the KGB,

239
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,279
the IRA remember, North Korea,

240
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:59,015
cyborgs, help me out...

241
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,784
LANA: Space pirates...

242
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,319
ARCHER: Oh my God, I forgot

243
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,253
about the space pirates!

244
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:04,487
But the point is,

245
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,588
we are highly trained

246
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,656
covert operatives with an

247
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,691
extremely dangerous set

248
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:08,958
of skills --

249
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,827
Pam, legs!

250
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,594
-- and since the government

251
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,696
has unjustly accused us

252
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:13,763
of treason,

253
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:14,597
we are now forced to transfer

254
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,167
those skills from espionage

255
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,535
to criminal activity,

256
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:19,969
kind of like the A-Team,

257
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,338
but we sell drugs.

258
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,172
LANA: And you're okay

259
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:22,806
with that.

260
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:23,840
ARCHER: Are you not? !

261
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,308
Lana, it's the A-Team

262

263
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,778
That makes me...

264
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,879
LANA: Hannibal Montana?

00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,548

RAMON: Pff, como siempre.

348
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,456
Y la tuya?

349
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,791
CHERYL/CAROL: Do, re --

350
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,859
[ BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM! ]

351
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,626
CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus!

352
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,194
Alright already!

353
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,662
MALORY: Thank you.

354
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,697
ARCHER: Como siempre.

355
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,432
RAMON: So, she telephone me,

356
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,000
ask if I know some maybe people,

357
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,001
I say yes,

358
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,169
I know some maybe people,

359
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,437
and here we are.

360
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,171
LANA: And, sorry,

361
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,172
you're getting out of this

362
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:09,939
maybe what?

363
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:10,707
ARCHER: Lana!

364
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,609
He's helping a dear friend!

365
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,210
RAMON: Sí, claro.

366
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,678
And also how you say,

367
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,380
a finder's fee?

368
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,648
Five thousand a kilo.

369
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,649
ARCHER: Oh.

370
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,884
RAMON: Because I want to buy

371
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,018
that place...

372
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,520
EVERYBODY: [ Gasps ]

373
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,854
RAMON: Nice, eh?

374
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,855
Is the best club in Miami.

375
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,557
ARCHER: Uh, duh!

376
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,359
LANA: Archer, what're you --

377
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,326
ARCHER: Lana, we're gonna need

378
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:31,160
an office in Miami,

379
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,462
and that office is gonna need

380
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,163
to be a red leather banquette!

381
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,198
RAMON: Dios mío,

382
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,833
that would be increíble!

383
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:39,002
You and me, together at last...

384
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:40,003
LANA: Implying that you two

385
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,971
haven't ever, cough,

386
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,740
been together, or...?

387
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,174
ARCHER: It was a mission, Lana!

388
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,309
Ramón's Latino,

389
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:47,210
so he's comfortable

390
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,378
expressing affection!

391
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,812
It doesn't make him gay!

392
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:50,480
RAMON: Although I am.

393
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,581
ARCHER: So go ahead, Lana,

394
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,715
judge away!

395
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,583
PAM: Right?

396
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:54,584
LANA: I -- Pam shut up,

397
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:55,652
and Archer you know better,

398
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,053
I don't care about that.

399
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,488
What I do care about are

400
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,522
these buyers of yours, Ramón.

401
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,823
Who are they?

402
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:02,225
RAMON: Just some guys.

403
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,760
We'll go see them, they're cool,

404
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:04,761
dun't worry about it.

405
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:06,095
LANA: Kinda feel like I should.

406
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,330
ARCHER: Lana, Ramón vouches

407
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,198
for them, I vouch for him,

408
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,567
and you're embarrassing me!

409
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,367
LANA: I am.

410
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,904
PAM: Kachoooo!

411
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,606
LANA: That's flour, by the way.

412
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,341
PAM: I know.

413
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:19,075
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't you think

414
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,877
I know that? !

415
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,278
I know it's bad,

416
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,947
I'm not ear-crippled!

417
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,181
GILLETTE: Well,

418
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,416
then maybe being a c --

419
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,784
CHERYL/CAROL: Not a,

420
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,018
the number one country music

421
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,286
singer in all of America,

422
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:31,354
and some of Canada!

423
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:32,922
what if maybe that goal's

424
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,591
not realistic?

425
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,727
Or even unlaughable?

426
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,096
CHERYL/CAROL: Get out!

427
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:40,897
ARCHER: Wait, seriously?

428
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:41,564
RAMON: Yes,

429
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,532
they were very clear,

430
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:43,366
no guns.

431
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:44,033
ARCHER: But --

432
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,101
RAMON: I gave mi palabra.

433
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,069
ARCHER: Right, sorry, I --

434
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:46,936
LANA: Archer.

435
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:47,470
ARCHER: Lana he gave

436
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,806
his palabra!

437
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,607
LANA: If anything goes wrong

438
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,642
I'm holding you responsible.

439
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:59,082
ARCHER: Yeah, that'll teach me.

440
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,083
CYRIL: Tough day, huh?

441
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:00,984
GILLETTE: The high point

442
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,218
was getting shot at.

443
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,586
CYRIL: It's so weird, I mean,

444
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,754
she's a billionaire,

445
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:05,955
she could be anything,

446
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,990
a world traveler,

447
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:07,924
an art collector...

448
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:08,725
GILLETTE: A transatlantic

449
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,259
goddamn balloonist!

450
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,794
CYRIL: So, why does she want

451
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,730
to be a country singer so badly?

452
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,331
Besides being clinically insane.

453
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,466
GILLETTE: Yeah.

454
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,303
Here's to the crazy ones.

455
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,641
CYRIL: Um...

456
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,642
RAMON: Ugh, díos mio,

457
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,643
that stinks!

458
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,178
PAM: It's not that bad!

459
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,782
I mean it's not great, but...

460
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,283
This is still some primo shit.

461
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:35,618
ARCHER: Pam! Quit eating

462
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,286
all the goddamn cocaine!

463
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:37,920
CHARLES: Yeah,

464
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,989
save some for us, bitches!

465
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,357
ARCHER: Charles and Rudi? !

466
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,659
LANA: Wait, the hitmen? !

467
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,260
RAMON: Tranquilo, tranquilo!

468
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:45,161
It's okay!

469
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:45,828
CHARLES: Yeah,

470
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,629
we're like BFF's now.

471
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:47,263
ARCHER: What? !

472
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:48,097
RAMON: Well...

473
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,133
here's your fondue set, and...

474
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,634
was there only one blue fork?

475
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,602
ARCHER: What the hell? !

476
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:53,770
CHARLES: And how is

477
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:54,537
that tone necessary?

478
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,538
RUDI: Thank you.

479
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,372
CHARLES: It's a fork.

480
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:57,306
RAMON: And there were two

481
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,641
of each color and you know this

482
00:11:58,643 --> 00:11:59,942
as well as me because we stood

483
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:01,678
in my kitchen and counted.

484
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,146
CHARLES: Well then I apologize,

485
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,013
and I'll be happy

486
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,381
to throw in another...

487
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,116
five dollars?

488
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:07,850
RAMON: Eighty dollars.

489
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,885
CHARLES: For a fork? !

490
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:10,353
RAMON: You can't buy only one

491
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,821
you have to buy the whole set!

492
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:13,222
CHARLES: Oh, that is such --

493
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:15,058
okay okay, ya know what?

494
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,892
Fine.

495
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:16,726
We'll call it one million

496
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:17,994
and eighty dollars!

497
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:18,561
RAMON: Well, there is a small

498
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,296
problem there.

499
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,364
CHARLES: What, we agreed

500
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,231
on fifty grand a kilo!

501
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,700
LANA: I think we're probably

502
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,400
a little closer to

503
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,402
nineteen and a half?

504
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:27,503
CHARLES: Okay, couple Q's,

505
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:28,471
I'd love some A's.

506
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:29,839
One, what the hell

507
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:30,807
is that thing?

508
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,341
ARCHER: We made a body cast

509
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:33,209
out of the coke.

510
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:33,976
RAMON: But I tested it,

511
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:35,211
it's very pure.

512
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,379
CHARLES: Mmkay, two,

513
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,047
how can you eat a pound of

514
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,048
cocaine and not be dead?

515
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,982
PAM: I've actually

516
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,251
never felt better!

517
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,219
I hope that lasts.

518
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:43,920
CHARLES: I'm sure it will,

519
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:45,021
okay here's the dilly

520
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:45,888
and the sweets.

521
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,156
We're gonna round that down

522
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,057
to nineteen kilos even,

523
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:48,991
so I'll just take back

524
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:49,592
fifty grand...

525
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,359
ARCHER: Way to go, Pam.

526
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,027
CHARLES: And since the coke's

527
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:51,894
in the shape of

528
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,729
a Poppin' Fresh costume,

529
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,663
and taintsweaty,

530
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:55,098
I'm taking off another fifty...

531
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,698
ARCHER: The hell you are!

532
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,432
CHARLES: Can I finish?

533
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,834
Can I finish?

534
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:58,868
Since Ramón gave his word

535
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,602
that you people

536
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,603
wouldn't bring any guns...

537
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,704
ARCHER: We didn't,

538
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,172
not even my underwear gun.

539
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,674
RAMON: I gave mi palabra.

540
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,908
CHARLES: Well that's just

541
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,509
terrific.

542
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:09,078
Because...

543
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,379
we're gonna go ahead and take

544
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,248
the cocaine and the money.

545
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,549
ARCHER: Goddammit.

546
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:15,051
LANA: And so, right about here

547
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,052
is the part where I hold

548
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,887
you responsible.

549
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,956
ARCHER: Oh my God the burden.

550
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,124
you take the fondue set

551
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,425
CHARLES: Can I finish? !

552
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,392
And I'll take the fondue set.

553
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:24,093
Because you were a total

554
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,062
b-hole about the fork.

555
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,198
It's not even real Le Creuset!

556
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,399
LANA: Ugh!

557
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,300
RAMON: Right?

558
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:31,768
Of course it is real.

559
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,070
the outlet store doesn't mean --

560
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:34,771
ARCHER: Ramón!

561
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,571
RAMON: What?

562
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:38,574
Sterling, are you angry with me?

563
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,642
Wait, you don't think this is

564
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:44,013
my fault? !

565
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,452
RAMON: Sterling, please!

566
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,820
This is loco!

567
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:51,888
ARCHER: No, Ramón,

568
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,122
getting my stolen money back

569
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,558
isn't loco, it's --

570
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,292
Wait, what's the word

571
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,326
for rational?

572
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,327
RAMON: Racional.

573
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,162
ARCHER: Goddammit.

574
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:00,296
LANA: What was loco

575
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,998
was trusting you!

576
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,966
RAMON: How can you say that? !

577
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,768
ARCHER: To Ramón, Of all people!

578
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,669
LANA: Look, I don't know

579
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,004
what kind of "history"

580
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,105
you two have together, but --

581
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,006
ARCHER: History? !

582
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,307
What're you trying to --

583
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,842
that's crazy,

584
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:14,310
we didn't even kiss!

585
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,779
PAM: Zip!

586
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:17,747
ARCHER: Do you even hear

587
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,148
how crazy you sound?

588
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,949
LANA: Do you? !

589
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,151
ARCHER: I dunno, yes, shut up.

590
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,152
Ramón, I'm sorry but this whole

591
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,021
thing is kinda your fault,

592
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,988
so you're taking us to

593
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,156
wherever Charles and Rudi

594
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,491
are having a money fight

595
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,627
with our million bucks.

596
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,162
RAMON: A million and eighty.

597
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,198
ARCHER: Alright, uno rampageeo!

598
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,965
Okay, Lana,

599
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,266
LANA: Votes we cut our

600
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,367
losses and go home.

601
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:39,502
While reminding you,

602
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,304
seemingly unnecessarily,

603
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:42,872
that she is pregnant.

604
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:43,840
ARCHER: Oh my God,

605
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,774
how long are you gonna use that

606
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,008
for an excuse?

607
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,943
LANA: Probably at least

608
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:48,110
through childbirth.

609
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:52,949
ARCHER: Oh, you were serious?

610
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,650
MALORY: Alright, I'm going home,

611
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,852
but --

612
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,019
What's her problem?

613
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,788
CYRIL: Scotch.

614
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,523
And also maybe

615
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,991
post-traumatic stress disorder,

616
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:02,992
from listening to --

617
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:03,826
CHERYL/CAROL: 40 miles

618
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:04,961
of mountain road...

619
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,663
MALORY: Carol?

620
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,664
KRIEGER: Yep yep yep!

621
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,832
MALORY: But...

622
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:10,833
how is that possible?

623
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:11,534
KRIEGER: I've got the whole

624
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,368
house wired up.

625
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,204
Bedrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms,

626
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,340
other bathrooms,

627
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:19,876
the swimming pool...

628
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,377
MALORY: I meant! Ass!

629
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,211
KRIEGER: Ow!

630
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,980
MALORY: How is she singing so...

631
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,014
well?

632
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:25,882
KRIEGER: Probably because

633
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:26,549
she doesn't know anyone's

634
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,550
watching.

635
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,251
You'd be amazed

636
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,051
what you people do

637
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,153
when you think you're alone.

638
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,188
Cyril.

639
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,257
Dammit Krieger, you -- ow!

640
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,324
MALORY: Turn it up!

641
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,325
CHERYL/CAROL: 40 miles

642
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:36,893
of Gerogia clay...

643
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,927
ARCHER: Oh my God.

644
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:38,895
This is exactly

645
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,429
how I pictured their house.

646
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:41,230
RAMON: Oh, wait until you see

647
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,332
inside, díos mio,

648
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,368
they just redid the kitchen.

649
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,068
LANA: Ahem.

650
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,936
ARCHER: What,

651
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:48,905
just because you have no taste.

652
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,705
LANA: Or patience,

653
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:50,573
so if you could hurry up

654
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,540
and get our money --

655
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:52,241
PAM: And cocaine and cocaine

656
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,276
get the cocai --

657
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,213
[ BLOOP. ]

658
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,014
PAM: Oh my God Lana, Lana,

659
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,081
you know what I could

660
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,017
totally go for right now? !

661
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,018
LANA: Some cocaine?

662
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,718
PAM: Right? !

663
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,587
PAM: Popety, pop pop pop, pow.

664
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,589
RAMON: Did I tell you?

665
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,858
Here, give me your gun.

666
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,792
Now push that button,

667
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,862
right there.

668
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:13,562
ARCHER: This is the

669
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:15,231
best kitchen ever!

670
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,099
CHARLES: Aww mercy, thank you...

671
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,067
Ya know, if we could go back in

672
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,734
time there's a few things

673
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:19,635
we'd change...

674
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:20,403
ARCHER: Goddammit...

675
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:21,103
CHARLES: But overall

676
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,771
we're pretty happy.

677
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,738
Even though it's gonna be a

678
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,540
bitch to scrub your brains

679
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,408
out of the grout.

680
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,076
RAMON: Charles, por favor!

681
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,110
You have your cocaine,

682
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,378
just give them their money!

683
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,613
CHARLES: Oh okay sure,

684
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,081
we've got it right here.

685
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,449
ARCHER: Oh! Great, yes,

686
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,418
and we've got about a five hour

687
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,586
flight home, with Pam...

688
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:40,756
PAM: Poppety pop pop, cocaine.

689
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,124
ARCHER: So can you

690
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,125
throw in a pound of coke?

691
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,327
CHARLES: Can I? !

692
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,828
I only totally insist!

693
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,829
ARCHER: Oh. So,

694
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,097
you're being facetious.

695
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:51,100
CHARLES: Extra-eemly, yes.

696
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,335
A, the coke is gone...

697
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:53,135
RAMON: What? !

698
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,803
What do you mean, gone? !

699
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,770
CHARLES: Not gone gone,

700
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:55,805

701

ARCHER: Wh-? ! Ramón? !

Who is you-know-who? !

703
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,608
RAMON: I, uh --

704
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,743
CHARLES: You still get your cut,

705
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:01,911

00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,080
ARCHER: What? !

00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,848
RAMON: Por qué no te callas? !

709
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,985
ARCHER: Ramón!

710
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:14,123
[ GUNFIRE ]

711
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,458
ARCHER: Ramón!

712
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,993
RAMON: Sterling...

713
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,294

714
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:20,663
I'm... sorry.

715
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,131
LANA: Sorry baby

716
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,500
sorry baby sorry baby...

717
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,537
PAM: Lanaaa! get cocaaaaaaine!

718
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,705
RAMON: Oh, Sterling,

719
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:31,774
I'm s-so c-cold...

720
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,275
ARCHER: What, like hearted?

721
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:34,276
Ramón, what the hell,

722
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:35,845
was this all a scam, or --

723
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,879
RAMON: No, I swear,

724
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,648
is just muy complicado.

725
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,983
Sorry,

726
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,651
I cannot explain right now.

727
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:43,486
ARCHER: Oh really? !

728
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:46,155
Why, because you're --

729
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,691
Dying, right, sorry.

730
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,859
RAMON: Take the money,

731
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,660
God knows you've earned it.

732
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:52,728
All I ask,

733
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,233
is one small favor...

734
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,734
Before I die.

735
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:00,569
ARCHER: Yes, Ramón,

736
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:02,038
I'll do anything!

737
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,205
LANA: You name it kid,

738
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,306
savings bond, a puppy,

739
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:05,207
breastfeed you senseless...

740
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,709
just forgive me

741
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,045
for what's about to happen.

742
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:20,022
LANA: So, um, quick question...

743
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:20,923
MALORY: Why the hell

744
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,191
were you kissing him? !

745
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:22,892
LANA: With what appeared

746
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:23,559
to be tongue...

747
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,360
ARCHER: Because, I --

748
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,196
it was muy complicado Lana!

749
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,097
And the last wish

750
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:29,532
of a dying man!

751
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:30,566
LANA: Who you had a crush on.

752
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,068
ARCHER: I -- no, I --

753
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,869
go smoke some menthols!

754
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,703
MALORY: Alright, Sterling,

755
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:35,871
calm down.

756
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:37,706
My God, it's not as if I care.

757
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,407
As long --

758
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,241
ARCHER: As long as I brought

759
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,076
back the money!

760
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:40,676
Is that what you were

761
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:41,210
going to say? !

762
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,244
MALORY: Yes.

763
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,212
And I don't have time for this,

764
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:44,447
I have a country music star

765
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:45,748
to manage.

766
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,882
CHERYL/CAROL: Says you!

767
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:47,883
MALORY: Says your contract,

768
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:48,617
missy!

769
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:49,552
Read it!

770
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:52,354
CHERYL/CAROL: You read it!

771
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:54,890
Goddammit.

772
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:55,691
CYRIL: And, I'm sorry,

773
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,927
the money is where, exactly?

774
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:58,761
ARCHER: Uh, in your

775
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,396
masturbators, you idiot.

776
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,098
CYRIL: Oh, I'm the idiot?

777
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,265
ARCHER: I mean, historically...

778
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,100
CYRIL: Well I'm not the one

779
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,401
who sold twenty kilos of coke

780
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,303
for... Monopoly money!

781
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,871
EVERYBODY: Huh? What?

782
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:09,972
CYRIL: It's counterfeit!

783
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,707
Every last bill!

784
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,909
MALORY: Son of a...!

785
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,578
Sterling, you fool,

786
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,779
was this was all just a huge

787
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,446
set up!

788
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,314
ARCHER: For what mother,

789
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,315
a funeral? !

790
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,983
They're all dead!

791
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,418
LANA: Yeah, but...

792
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,253
are they?

793
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,054
LANA: We got out of there

794
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,089
in a hurry...

795
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:28,457
ARCHER: Ramóoooon!

796
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,127
LANA: Will you come on? !

797
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,828
ARCHER: But the gunshots...

798
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,597
all the blood.

799
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,799
LANA: Blood packs and blanks.

800
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,167
ARCHER: Even Ramón?

801
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,302
LANA: Especially Ramón.

802
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,303
I bet the whole thing

803
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,805
was his idea.

804
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,806
ARCHER: Aha!

805
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,840
You're forgetting a key

806
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,242
piece of the puzzle, Lana!

807
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:47,676
They'd already stolen our coke,

808
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,411
and they had the money!

809
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,279
Why go to the trouble

810
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,982
of a fake shootout? !

811
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,250
CHARLES: See what I'm saying?

812
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,284
RAMON: But this way,

813
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,485
we have twenty kilos of pure,

814
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,787
uncut, Colombian cocaine.

815
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:59,588
CHARLES: Holy shit, yes!

816
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,490
Which we had already stolen,

817
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,925
so we still would've had it!

818
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:03,926
Plus the counterfeit

819
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:04,760
million dollars,

820
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:05,995
which now we don't have!

821
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,629
RAMON: Ohhhhh...

822
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:07,363
CHARLES: Like, fifty times

823
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,964
I tried to explain this!

824
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:09,965
RAMON: I see now,

825
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,200
what you were saying.

826
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:12,134
CHARLES: Ta-daaaaa!

827
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,169
Jesus, it's like trying to

828
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,638
explain particle physics to...

829
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,272
a particle.

830
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,640
RAMON: Aha! But this way,

831
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,108
my way, Archer thinks

832
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,109
we are dead,

833
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,011
so he will never think to come

834
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,447
looking for us again!

835
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,883
CHARLES: It was still a stupid,

836
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:32,688
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,

837
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,591
stupid, stupid, stupid plan.
