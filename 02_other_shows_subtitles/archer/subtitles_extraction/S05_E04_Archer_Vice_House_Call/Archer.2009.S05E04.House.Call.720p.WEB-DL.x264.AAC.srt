1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,559
>> CYRIL: And so, if I could

2
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:03,560
direct your attention to these

3
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:04,761
visual aids...

4
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:06,229
you will see that from our

5
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:08,565
initial supply of 1,000 kilos of

6
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,733
cocaine, we...

7
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:10,734
>> ARCHER: Hang on, dummy, we

8
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:11,935
had a ton of cocaine.

9
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:13,570
>> CYRIL: No, we... Well, we had

10
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,439
a tonne, T-O-N-N-E, also known

11
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,074
as a metric ton, but...

12
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,141
>> MALORY: (scoffs) Metric.

13
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,142
Who uses metric?

14
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,143
>> LANA: Every single country on

15
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,144
the planet except for us,

16
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,145
Liberia and Burma.

17
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:22,980
>> ARCHER: Wow, really?

18
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,614
>> ARCHER: 'Cause you never

19
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:25,615
think of those other two as

20
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:26,616
having their shit together.

21
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,617
>> CYRIL: Anyway, as you can

22
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,251
see...

23
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:28,986
>> MALORY: Why are they

24
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:29,619
thermometers?

25
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:31,254
>> PAM: I thought they were

26
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,956
>> ARCHER: Wait, they're not?

27
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,491
>> CYRIL: No... they... are...

28
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,592
not... cocks!

29
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:37,761
>> RON: Okay! Jesus, you people.

30
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:38,762
Next time, remind me to get shot

31
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:39,763
in the head.

32
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,764
>> ARCHER: Uh, Ron, next time,

33
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:41,765
get shot in the head.

34
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:42,766
>> MALORY: Sterling, shut up.

35
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:44,101
Cyril, continue.

36
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,469
>> CYRIL (sighs): So, as you can

37
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,437
see, we are already down to 125

38
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,606
kilos of cocaine, which was

39
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,675
worth about $6 million, so...

40
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,676
>> ARCHER: And, wait, how much

41
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,677
is that in pounds?

42
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,678
>> CYRIL: Forget pounds!

43
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,846
We're doing kilos!

44
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:56,847
>> ARCHER: No, I meant pounds...

45
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,514
>> MALORY: Sterling!

46
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,515
>> ARCHER: Exactly.

47
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,017
As in <i>Doctor Who</i> money.

48
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,018
>> MALORY: How do you stand

49
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,352
there and crack wise when this

50
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,520
is all your fault?

51
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,521
>> ARCHER: My fault?

52
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,790
I only lost 44.092 pounds of it,

53
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,791
mother.

54
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,192
It's Pam's fault we had to give

55
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,361
the Yakuza 100 kilos.

56
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,130
And this other five-- spoiler

57
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,498
alert-- she ate!

58
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,866
>> LANA: Yeah, and would now be

59
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,034
a good time to talk about Pam's

60
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,368
cocaine addiction?

61
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,369
>> PAM: Or the inspiring story

62
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,837
of her heroic struggle to

63
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,806
finally triumph over it?

64
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:24,174
>> LANA: What are you eating?

65
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:25,175
>> PAM (mouth full): Yogurt!

66
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:26,176
(grunting)

67
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,010
>> MALORY: Give me that!

68
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:27,644
>> PAM: Hey!

69
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:28,645
>> MALORY: Lick it.

70
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:29,713
>> ARCHER: (groans) Well, can't

71
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,982
unhear that.

72
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:34,017
Holy shit, yogurt is amazing!

73
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,352
Why have I never tried yogurt?!

74
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:36,653
>> LANA: How have you never

75
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:37,687
tried yogurt?

76
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:38,722
>> ARCHER: Mmm, I didn't know it

77
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,723
was that good.

78
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,724
>> MALORY: It's good because

79
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,725
it's cocaine!

80
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,060
>> ARCHER (gasps): Oh, my God.

81
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,061
And little kids eat it?

82
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,062
>> MALORY: Cyril, you said it

83
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,063
was locked up.

84
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,064
>> CYRIL: It is.

85
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,065
In the cage in the pantry.

86
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,066
>> MALORY: Then how did she get

87
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,067
it?

88
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,569
(Pam whistling)

89
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,074
That is it!

90
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,375
You're going to rehab.

91
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,177
>> PAM: What?! No, I can't!

92
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,178
And you can't make me!

93
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,179
>> ARCHER: Yeah, is that even

94
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,180
necessary?

95
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:04,181
I think she's in a pretty good

96
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,182
place.

97
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,183
>> MALORY: She's going and

98
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:07,184
that's final, and...

99
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:08,185
>> PAM: I swear to God, if you

100
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,519
send me to freakin' rehab, I'll

101
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,520
go right to the cops!

102
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:11,521
>> LANA: What?!

103
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:12,522
>> ARCHER: Oh, come on.

104
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,357
>> MALORY: You wouldn't dare.

105
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,926
>> PAM (laughing): Oh, yeah?!

106
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:16,927
Just try...

107
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,361
(clang)

108
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,363
>> LANA: Goddamn, Woodhouse.

109
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:21,364
>> WOODHOUSE: Only thing for a

110
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,400
grass, mum.

111
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,068
And, sir, I'm afraid your

112
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,570
breakfast will be four minutes

113
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:28,705
late.

114
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,475
>> ARCHER (groans): Typical.

115
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:11,915
>> ARCHER: What are you doing?

116
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:12,916
Come on. Tighter.

117
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:13,917
>> LANA: Oh, for the... That's

118
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,918
tight enough-- we're not making

119
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,419
tit bondage porn.

120
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,420
>> ARCHER: That's a thing?

121
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:18,421
>> CYRIL: Oh, yeah.

122
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,089
(Malory groans)

123
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,090
>> ARCHER: Ditto.

124
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,124
I just don't want her to escape.

125
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:22,259
You know how strong she is.

126
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,260
Might as well be green and

127
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:24,261
half-deaf.

128
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:25,262
>> LANA: What if we move the

129
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:26,463
coke and lock <i>her</i> in the cage

130
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:27,464
till she's clean?

131
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,465
>> ARCHER: Hey, yeah, sweat it

132
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:29,466
out, like Popeye Doyle.

133
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:30,467
How long would that take?

134
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,301
>> LANA: I don't know.

135
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:32,302
Couple of weeks?

136
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,303
>> MALORY: Try couple of never.

137
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,938
This is Pam we're talking about,

138
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,273
the poster child for addictive

139
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,508
personality.

140
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,343
What is wrong with you?

141
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,444
>> ARCHER (crying): I learned it

142
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,313
by watching you.

143
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,814
Oh, my God.

144
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,516
>> LANA: Yeah, spoiler alert.

145
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,351
So, what do you suggest we do?

146
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,352
>> MALORY (gasps): We throw her

147
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,620
a party.

148
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,189
With an enormous cake!

149
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,456
Cyril, can we spare another five

150
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,624
pounds of cocaine?

151
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:55,625
>> LANA: Malory!

152
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,861
>> MALORY: 2.27 kilograms, then!

153
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,862
Who are you, Thomas Corwin

154
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,863
Mendenhall?

155
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,864
>> ARCHER: Right?

156
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,299
>> LANA: We're not killing Pam!

157
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,300
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, what?

158
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:04,301
>> RON: Jesus. Oh, come on in.

159
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:05,302
Make some more noise.

160
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,303
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Just 'cause

161
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:07,304
now you're the fat one?

162
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:08,305
>> LANA: Um, I said we were not

163
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,306
killing her.

164
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,307
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.

165
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,308
>> LANA: And, also, this is a

166
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,309
baby.

167
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,143
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Ew!

168
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,144
>> LANA: A baby, by the way,

169
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,545
that I did not eat but to which

170
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,546
I will give birth.

171
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,547
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Ew!

172
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,682
>> ARCHER (chuckles): Right?

173
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:19,683
>> MALORY: Well, if she won't go

174
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,684
to rehab and you won't let her

175
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:21,985
die with dignity...

176
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,153
>> LANA: From an overdose of

177
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:24,321
cocaine cake?!

178
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:25,322
>> MALORY: Oh, please.

179
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,823
Change the word "cocaine" to

180
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,525
"Cookie Puss" and that's how her

181
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:29,526
obituary was going to read

182
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:30,527
anyway.

183
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,528
>> LANA: What the...

184
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,529
>> KRIEGER: I may have a simply

185
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,530
elegant solution.

186
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:34,531
>> LANA: Krieger.

187
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,532
>> KRIEGER: Right?

188
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,700
This place is like a Habitrail--

189
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:37,701
there are secret passages

190
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,236
everywhere.

191
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,237
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I think that's

192
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,238
why the colored maids never felt

193
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,339
safe.

194
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,007
They'd be polishing a spittoon

195
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,175
or whatever and suddenly...

196
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:46,176
Grandpa.

197
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,177
(others gasp)

198
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,245
Yeah. And dressed up like a

199
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,246
ghost?

200
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,247
>> LANA: What is it with your

201
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,348
family wearing ghost costumes to

202
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,549
scare black people?

203
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,550
>> CHERYL/CAROL: What is it with

204
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,018
you people making tit bondage

205
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,220
pornos in my ancestral home?!

206
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:58,355
>> KRIEGER: Ah, <i>einige</i>

207
00:04:58,357 --> 00:04:59,889
 <i>Tittenfreude,</i> huh?

208
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,024
>> CYRIL: Ooh, <i>ja.</i>

209
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,025
>> MALORY: So what's all this

210
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,193
about a solution?

211
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,227
>> KRIEGER: Aha! Yes.

212
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:05,228
And what is on my finger, you

213
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,229
ask?

214
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:07,230
>> LANA: I promise you no one is

215
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,231
asking that.

216
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,232
>> KRIEGER: Well, they should

217
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,700
because this nearly microscopic,

218
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,202
wittle-bitty guy is my new and

219
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,204
improved mind control chip.

220
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,205
>> ARCHER: Improved?

221
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,373
On the one that made Len Trexler

222
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,208
think he was a giant lettuce?

223
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,276
>> MALORY (gasps): Len

224
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,543
Trexler...

225
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:21,745
>> RON: Who the hell is Len

226
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:22,746
Trexler?

227
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,381
>> MALORY: Never heard of him.

228
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,382
>> KRIEGER: It's way improved,

229
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,416
and look how tiny.

230
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:27,550
I don't even need a drill-- I

231
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,718
can inject it right through the

232
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,719
temple.

233
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,720
>> PAM: Wait, what are we doing?

234
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:31,721
>> ARCHER: Stabbing science into

235
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:32,722
your brain.

236
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:33,390
>> PAM: What?!

237
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:34,391
>> MALORY: It's for your own

238
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:35,392
good, dear.

239
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:36,393
>> ARCHER: Yeah, so you don't

240
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:37,927
wind up giving blow jobs in a

241
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,729
bus station toilet.

242
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,231
But for cocaine.

243
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,932
>> PAM: No! Let me go!

244
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,134
(growling)

245
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,302
>> MALORY: Krieger, do you think

246
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,569
a chip could cure someone of

247
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:47,570
stage fright?

248
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:48,571
>> CHERYL/CAROL (gasps): No way!

249
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,140
>> MALORY: But you could be

250
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,608
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I could be

251
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,109
>> MALORY: Now, you listen to

252
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,110
me, missy.

253
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:55,445
You are getting a brain chip,

254
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:56,579
and then you're going on the

255
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,581
Grand Old Opera, and I don't

256
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,783
care if it kills you be...

257
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:00,784
(screams)

258
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:01,785
(Pam roars)

259
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:02,786
>> LANA: Pam, honey, just calm

260
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,087
down!

261
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,155
(Pam growls)

262
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,156
>> MALORY: Somebody do

263
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,157
something!

264
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,491
>> CYRIL: Nobody do anything!

265
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,260
>> ARCHER: Lana...

266
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,294
(Pam growls)

267
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,295
Lana!

268
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,296
>> LANA: Krieger!

269
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,297
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, I'm on it.

270
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,432
>> MALORY: Ow!

271
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:16,633
Idiot.

272
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,468
(Cheryl/Carol screams)

273
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,170
(Pam growls)

274
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,771
>> LANA: Pam!

275
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:22,839
>> ARCHER: Lana...!

276
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,840
>> CHERYL/CAROL: This is only

277
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,175
somewhat like that old Gypsy

278
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,345
woman said...!

279
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,513
>> ARCHER: Lana.

280
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,514
>> LANA: What?!

281
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,016
God shit damn it, Archer, what?!

282
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,651
>> ARCHER: Um, never mind.

283
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,652
>> LANA: Archer, I s...

284
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:36,653
>> ARCHER: The last thing you

285
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:37,654
need right now is a big,

286
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,122
shit-eating "I told you so."

287
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:40,123
(Lana groans)

288
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,291
>> MALORY: But it's exactly what

289
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,325
you deserve.

290
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:43,793
And, Krieger, I hope you have a

291
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,628
lot more where this came from

292
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,830
because...

293
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,997
>> LANA: Super.

294
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:48,998
Hunting women to force them to

295
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,300
have surgery against their will.

296
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,334
>> MALORY: It's for Pam's own

297
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,335
good.

298
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:53,370
She'll die if she doesn't quit

299
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,371
eating cocaine.

300
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,472
>> LANA: And who's gonna die if

301
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,639
you don't get rich managing

302
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:57,874
Cheryl's singing career?

303
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:58,875
>> MALORY: Maybe you.

304
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,876
Now, get out there and have

305
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:00,877
some fun!

306
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,878
>> ARCHER: How could we not?

307
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,879
(Woodhouse clears throat)

308
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,880
Woodhouse, I swear to God, if

309
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,881
you tell me lunch is four

310
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,882
minutes late...

311
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,883
>> WOODHOUSE: No, sir.

312
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,319
There's a Mr. Holly here.

313
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,221
Sorry, an Agent Holly.

314
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,022
From the FBI.

315
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,824
(others gasp, groan)

316
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,493
>> ARCHER: But lunch is still

317
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:18,828
a firm twelve.

318
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,363
(chuckles)

319
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:21,865
Firm twelve.

320
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,167
You know, as in inches?

321
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,170
Jesus, .3048 meters.

322
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:28,171
Hi.

323
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:29,339
Welcome to Nazi Canada!

324
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,875
(gagging sounds)

325
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:34,411
Eh?

326
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,848
>> MALORY: Why is the FBI here?

327
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,849
>> CYRIL: Did he show you a

328
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:40,850
warrant?

329
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:41,684
>> WOODHOUSE: No, sir, he...

330
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,685
>> CYRIL: Then tell him to go

331
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:43,686
piss off-- he can't come inside

332
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:44,254
without a warrant.

333
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:44,921
>> WOODHOUSE: He...

334
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:45,922
>> CYRIL: Well, unless you

335
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,923
invite him in.

336
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:47,924
>> ARCHER (groans): He's not a

337
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,025
vampire, idiot.

338
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,727
>> ARCHER: Plus it's daytime.

339
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,195
>> CYRIL: If invited in, law

340
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,363
enforcement can enter your home

341
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,364
without a warrant.

342
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,398
Once inside, under the doctrine

343
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,100
of "plain view," anything

344
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,601
illegal-- say, a truckload of

345
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,769
cocaine in the kitchen-- can be

346
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,571
lawfully seized as evidence.

347
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,572
They can also enter a private

348
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:04,073
residence under any number of

349
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,375
exigent circumstances, like

350
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,609
providing emergency assistance

351
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,211
to an occupant, say, if they

352
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:09,245
heard someone screaming...

353
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:10,246
(Malory screams)

354
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:11,080
(others gasp)

355
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,549
>> HOLLY: Good morning.

356
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,617
>> CYRIL: No, sir, good day.

357
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,752
I insist that you leave

358
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,620
immediately, as you have entered

359
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,222
this residence unlawfully.

360
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:20,223
>> HOLLY: Uh, you want to jump

361
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,558
in here, Yoda's dad?

362
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,625
>> WOODHOUSE: I invited him in.

363
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,626
>> MALORY: Woodhouse!

364
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,727
>> HOLLY: And once you do that,

365
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,062
you know, we are in.

366
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:27,897
Not unlike vampires.

367
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:28,898
>> ARCHER: See?

368
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,467
>> MALORY: Be that as it may,

369
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,568
why are you here?

370
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,735
>> HOLLY: Oh, just checking in,

371
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:33,736
making sure you folks aren't

372
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,138
engaging in treason, espionage

373
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,139
or anything else illegal.

374
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,140
>> MALORY: Well, I can assure

375
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:37,774
you...

376
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:38,475
>> HOLLY: Like drugs.

377
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,108
>> MALORY: Hmm?

378
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,742
>> HOLLY: Cocaine?

379
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,410
>> MALORY: Nope.

380
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:40,977
>> HOLLY: Yakuza?

381
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,611
>> MALORY: Mm-mm.

382
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:42,278
>> HOLLY: Shootout?

383
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,913
>> HOLLY: No one here was shot

384
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,582
>> MALORY (chuckling): Well, I

385
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,416
think we'd remember that.

386
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,283
>> HOLLY: Then what's his

387
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:47,917
problem?

388
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,585
>> LANA: Vasectomy.

389
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,252
>> CYRIL: Piles.

390
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:49,819
>> ARCHER: Gout.

391
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,453
>> CYRIL: Mumps.

392
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,155
>> KRIEGER: Progeria! (sniffles)

393
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,156
He's just a little boy.

394
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,257
>> CYRIL: But whatever <i>is</i> wrong

395
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:54,824
with him...

396
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,592
>> ARCHER: Goutmumps.

397
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:56,593
>> CYRIL: ...is none of your

398
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:57,594
business, and since nothing in

399
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:58,595
plain view would lead a

400
00:08:58,597 --> 00:08:59,829
reasonable person to suspect

401
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,830
illegal activity, I demand that

402
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,831
you...

403
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,266
(Gillette screams)

404
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,601
>> HOLLY: Nobody move!

405
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:05,602
>> MALORY: Well?!

406
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:06,603
>> CYRIL (sighs): They can also

407
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:07,670
do what's known as a...

408
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,105
>> HOLLY: Protective sweep...!

409
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,273
>> CYRIL: Case law regarding

410
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,508
search-and-seizure is actually

411
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,642
quite interesting...

412
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,444
>> MALORY: What... about... the

413
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:15,445
cocaine?

414
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,446
(Cyril speaking indistinctly)

415
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:17,447
>> CYRIL: ...admissible as

416
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,448
evidence but only if he sees

417
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,449
it.

418
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,450
>> MALORY: So we have to

419
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:21,518
keep him out of the kitchen.

420
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,685
All right, fan out!

421
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,820
Agent Holly is the prime target,

422
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:24,821
but...

423
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:25,822
>> LANA: So, just so we're

424
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:26,823
clear, you want us to

425
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,358
tranquilize a federal agent.

426
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,359
>> MALORY: Do you have a better

427
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,360
idea?

428
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,528
>> LANA: I do not.

429
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,529
>> MALORY: Then we just slap

430
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,796
some panties and rouge on him,

431
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:34,964
pose him with Gillette-- whose

432
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,466
fault this is!-- make some

433
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,467
glossy 8x10s...

434
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,468
>> KRIEGER: I'll do it!

435
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,469
I have a camera! Dibs!

436
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:40,470
>> MALORY: And then I doubt

437
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,471
we'll be hearing from Agent

438
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,472
Holly in the future.

439
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:43,473
>> CYRIL: Or you could pose him

440
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:44,474
with Woodhouse.

441
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:45,475
>> WOODHOUSE: What?

442
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:46,476
>> KRIEGER (chuckles): God

443
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:47,477
knows he's a little GILF.

444
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,478
(others groan)

445
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,479
>> ARCHER: That's a thing?!

446
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:50,480
>> CYRIL: How do you not know

447
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,848
the different kinds of porn?

448
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,982
>> ARCHER: Because I have sex

449
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,484
with actual women, Cyril!

450
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,685
My girlfriend's not equal parts

451
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,554
the Internet, a tube of Kentucky

452
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,889
jelly, self-loathing and a sock!

453
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,890
>> MALORY: Tell that to your

454
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,891
cellmate!

455
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,892
Now, go!

456
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:03,893
>> GILLETTE (slurred): You

457
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,028
scared the shit out of me!

458
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,029
>> CHERYL/CAROL (groans): What,

459
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,030
literally?

460
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,031
>> PAM: Seriously, dude, what is

461
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,032
up with you?

462
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,033
>> GILLETTE (sniffles): I could

463
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,367
walk, and now I can't, and ain't

464
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,069
nobody loves ol' Ray no more.

465
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,070
(crying)

466
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,071
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Well, yeah,

467
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,239
you're disgusting.

468
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,508
But, you, I am totally digging

469
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,376
this whole Queen Kong vibe.

470
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,544
(Pam growls)

471
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,546
(Gillette sobbing)

472
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:24,747
>> HOLLY: My God, are they...

473
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,915
torturing a woman?

474
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,183
Hang on, ma'am!

475
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,184
I'm a federal agent, and I'm

476
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,352
coming!

477
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:30,353
By God, I am coming!

478
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,521
>> LANA: Okay, you three head

479
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:32,722
upstairs...

480
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:33,890
>> ARCHER: Hang on.

481
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:34,891
>> LANA: I'm going to the

482
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,892
kitchen to make sure he doesn't

483
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:36,893
stumble onto the coke.

484
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:37,894
>> ARCHER: Hang on.

485
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:38,895
>> LANA: What?

486
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,896
>> ARCHER: Question.

487
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:40,897
>> LANA: What?

488
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:41,898
>> ARCHER: Are we not saying

489
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,899
"phrasing" anymore?

490
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,900
Which, that's fine, whatever,

491
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,201
but if we're doing a new thing

492
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,569
and nobody told me-- that I'd

493
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,870
have a problem with.

494
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:51,040
>> HOLLY: Oh, screw me!

495
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,275
>> ARCHER: Said Ripley to the

496
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,543
android Bishop.

497
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,878
Wait, hang on. Um...

498
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,447
Goddamn it!

499
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,715
What was wrong with "phrasing"?!

500
00:10:58,717 --> 00:10:59,882
>> GILLETTE: Nothing!

501
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,050
I'm fine.

502
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,251
Just get out, leave me alone!

503
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:03,453
>> HOLLY: I just need to be sure

504
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,721
you're not being held here

505
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,956
against your...

506
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,092
That is a federal offense!

507
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,293
>> GILLETTE: I said, get <i>out...!</i>

508
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,561
>> KRIEGER: Oh, hey, remind me

509
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:12,929
to reboot the CPU in Ray's spine

510
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:14,097
so he can walk again.

511
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,298
>> CYRIL: What?

512
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,566
A reboot-- that's all it takes?!

513
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:17,734
>> KRIEGER: Beep boop.

514
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:18,935
>> CYRIL: He's been paralyzed

515
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,136
for months.

516
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,137
What the hell have you been

517
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,405
waiting for?!

518
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,573
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, but think how

519
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:24,774
much happier he'll be now.

520
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:25,775
>> LANA: Or-- and I'm just

521
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:26,943
spitballin' here-- I find Holly

522
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,411
first, show him the coke, get

523
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,313
immunity, testify against them,

524
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,148
then you and I go into witness

525
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,583
protection and spend the rest of

526
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,952
our miserable lives on the run,

527
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:37,153
hounded by the fact that we

528
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,421
betrayed our friends.

529
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,589
Ugh!

530
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,790
Or I get arrested and give birth

531
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:41,958
in a supermax prison and...

532
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,159
Oh, wait.

533
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,427
Does the baby grow up in prison,

534
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,595
or...?

535
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:46,796
>> WOODHOUSE: Oh.

536
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,965
Hello, old friend.

537
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,433
>> LANA: What the shit, Archer?!

538
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,601
>> ARCHER: Hang on.

539
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:52,802
I knew you'd shoot without

540
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:53,970
looking.

541
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:54,971
>> LANA: Oh, really, you know me

542
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:56,172
that well?!

543
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,173
>> ARCHER: Uh, well enough to

544
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,174
know you're down here wondering

545
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,175
if witness protection ever sends

546
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,443
people to the Virgin Islands.

547
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:01,611
>> LANA: Well, in case you'd

548
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:02,812
forgotten, I have an unborn

549
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:03,980
child to think about!

550
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:05,181
>> ARCHER: Jesus Christ, Lana,

551
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,449
who can forget?

552
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,617
It's baby this, baby that.

553
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,452
>> LANA: Aw, Baby Archer, who's

554
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,653
a jeawous baby?

555
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:11,854
>> ARCHER: What?!

556
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,022
Holy shit, do you have anemia?

557
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,290
>> LANA: No, I...

558
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,458
>> ARCHER: Uh, edema,

559
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,993
hypertension, preeclampsia,

560
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,461
Braxton-Hicks contractions,

561
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:19,629
pica?!

562
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:20,830
>> LANA: I...

563
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:21,998
>> ARCHER: GERD?!

564
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,199
Lana, do you have GERD?!

565
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,467
(Lana clears her throat)

566
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:25,635
>> LANA: How do you know about

567
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:26,836
the various possible

568
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,004
complications of pregnancy?

569
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:29,172
Archer?

570
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,373
>> ARCHER: Maybe I looked it up.

571
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,641
>> LANA: Why?

572
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:32,809
>> ARCHER: I was concerned about

573
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,010
you.

574
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,178
Blow me!

575
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,379
>> LANA: Just making sure you're

576
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,647
not into preggo porn.

577
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:38,815
>> ARCHER: Oh, goddamn it!

578
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,016
That can't be a thing!

579
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,217
>> LANA: It is absolutely a

580
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,985
thing, and do you just not have

581
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:44,153
the Internet, or...?

582
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,354
>> ARCHER: I have Minitel, okay?

583
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,690
>> LANA: A: not the Internet,

584
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,891
B: only works in...

585
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,059
>> ARCHER: France, Lana.

586
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,028
 <i>Oui, maintenant je sais!</i>

587
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,229
>> LANA: Okay, um, thanks for

588
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,664
your concern, and I don't know

589
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,865
what you think you heard about

590
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:56,866
witness protection, but...

591
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:58,034
>> ARCHER: They don't make

592
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,869
babies grow up in prison, Lana.

593
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,037
>> LANA: Yeah, right?

594
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,238
>> ARCHER: They take them away

595
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,506
the minute they're born and send

596
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:04,674
them to an orphanage.

597
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,875
>> LANA: No, not the minute

598
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:07,043
they're...

599
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,244
>> ARCHER: That very minute,

600
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,412
Lana!

601
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,680
They don't even dry them off!

602
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,848
(Lana cries)

603
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,049
So if I were you, I'd run out

604
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,250
that door while I still had a

605
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,518
chance.

606
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,686
>> LANA: But-but, Archer, I...

607
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,055
>> ARCHER: I'd also waste five

608
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,256
precious minutes of my head

609
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,058
start in the race to freedom

610
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,860
giving that swell guy Archer a

611
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:25,061
combination good-bye/thank-you

612
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,262
blow job.

613
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,766
(Lana cries)

614
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,234
(Lana laughs)

615
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,235
>> LANA: Asshole.

616
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:33,436
>> ARCHER: Yeah, or a rim job.

617
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,704
What do you care?

618
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,872
You're never gonna see him

619
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:37,073
again.

620
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,241
>> LANA: I can't.

621
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:39,442
>> ARCHER: I know.

622
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,710
I was kidding, stupid.

623
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:41,878
>> LANA: I mean I can't leave

624
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,079
you, stupid!

625
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:44,280
(loud knocking)

626
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,548
>> HOLLY: This is the FBI!

627
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,284
Open this door!

628
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,452
>> ARCHER: Well, not now...

629
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,720
stupid.

630
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,888
And so, wait.

631
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,089
Where did we land on that

632
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,290
blow job?

633
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,826
Sorry, rim job.

634
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,430
>> HOLLY: Do you hear me?!

635
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,899
Open this door!

636
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:04,767
Obstructing... a federal

637
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,569
agent... is a felony...

638
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:07,770
punishable...

639
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:08,938
Ow!

640
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,139
...by up to 20 years

641
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,407
imprisonment, if said

642
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,408
obstruction results in the

643
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,076
bodily injury of said agent,

644
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,278
which I think may have just

645
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,746
happened to said agent's-- ow!--

646
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:17,914
rotator cuff.

647
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,115
Aah!

648
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,316
>> LANA: 20 years?!

649
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,584
>> ARCHER: Lana, look at all

650
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,752
that coke!

651
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:23,753
20 years is just gonna be the

652
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:24,754
Bac-Os on our prison salad.

653
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:25,755
Besides, technically, Woodhouse

654
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:26,923
is the one obstructing.

655
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,124
>> LANA: Archer!

656
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,125
>> ARCHER: Relax. They don't

657
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:30,126
send people that old to prison.

658
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,327
It costs, like, two grand a day

659
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,595
just to keep them alive.

660
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,763
>> LANA: I'm talking about us!

661
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:34,931
>> ARCHER: Hmm. I don't know.

662
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,132
A hundred bucks?

663
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:37,333
Depends who you ask, Lana.

664
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,601
Liberals say this much,

665
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:39,769
conservatives say this much...

666
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:40,770
>> LANA: So, now you're just

667
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:41,938
dicking around?

668
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,139
>> ARCHER: Yes.

669
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,340
>> LANA: Between the FBI and a

670
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,608
ton of cocaine.

671
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,776
>> ARCHER: Yes.

672
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,944
>> LANA: So, can I assume you

673
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:49,145
have a plan?

674
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,346
>> ARCHER: Yes.

675
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,614
I mean, I don't, but you can

676
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:52,782
assu... Ow! Ow!

677
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:53,950
(Holly grunts)

678
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,151
Ow! Ow! <i>Ow!</i>

679
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,352
(Holly groans)

680
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,620
>> HOLLY: I'm coming!

681
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:58,788
>> ARCHER: Said Ripley to... Ow!

682
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,956
Goddamn it, woman!

683
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,157
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Come on!

684
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,025
Why are you slowing down?!

685
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,661
>> PAM: Need... got to...

686
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:06,863
More cocaine.

687
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,030
>> CHERYL/CAROL: So, please

688
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,298
don't take this the wrong way--

689
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,466
because I'm loving being your

690
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,667
Esmeralda-- but you may have a

691
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,869
problem.

692
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,036
And it sounds like the solution

693
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,304
is more cocaine, so turn left up

694
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:16,472
there.

695
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:17,673
>> MALORY: But why are you

696
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,875
leaving?

697
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,042
They can't compel a husband and

698
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,310
wife to testify against each

699
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:22,478
other!

700
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,679
>> RON: Oh, yeah?

701
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,881
They may not have to compel me.

702
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,048
(Malory gasps)

703
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,316
>> MALORY: And what is that

704
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:28,484
supposed to mean?!

705
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:29,485
>> RON: Oh, why don't you ask

706
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,486
that guy you never heard of,

707
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,687
Len Trexler?

708
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:32,889
>> MALORY: How can I?

709
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,056
I've never heard of him.

710
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,324
>> RON: You wouldn't know the

711
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,492
truth if it bit you on the ass

712
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:37,693
and held on, would you?

713
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:38,895
>> MALORY: Ron, wait!

714
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,062
>> RON: What?!

715
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,231
>> MALORY: Well, if you insist

716
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,333
on being an ass, I can't stop

717
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,202
you, but there is the small

718
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,503
matter of my putting the deed

719
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:48,671
to my apartment in your name.

720
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:49,872
(Ron laughs)

721
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,008
>> RON: Ah, it's your loss!

722
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,209
I'll mail you your furs.

723
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,410
(Malory gasps)

724
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,678
>> MALORY: Don't you dare!

725
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,079
At the very least, I insist on a

726
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,347
bonded courier!

727
00:15:58,349 --> 00:15:59,515
Ron?!

728
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:00,716
(Holly grunts)

729
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:01,918
>> ARCHER: Ow!

730
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,085
Lana, cut it... Ow! Ow!

731
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,353
(Holly groans)

732
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,521
>> ARCHER: Ow! Ow!

733
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,522
>> HOLLY: What's this door made

734
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,723
out of, mithril?

735
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:08,925
>> ARCHER: Ow!

736
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:09,926
>> LANA: Just once, why can't

737
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,093
you take...

738
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,361
>> ARCHER: Ow!

739
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,362
>> LANA: ...anything seriously

740
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,530
just once?

741
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:15,531
>> ARCHER: Ow! I was serious

742
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,732
about that rim jo... Ow!

743
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:17,934
Seriously, please stop hitting

744
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,101
me.

745
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,369
What the...?

746
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:21,537
>> CYRIL: Oh, thank God!

747
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,738
>> LANA: Cyril? Wait.

748
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,906
How did you...?

749
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,074
>> KRIEGER: This house is

750
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,275
insane.

751
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,276
>> CYRIL: And scary, and gross,

752
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,277
and I'm pretty sure I smelled a

753
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,545
skeleton.

754
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:30,546
>> KRIEGER: No, you definitely

755
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:31,547
smelled a skeleton.

756
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,548
>> LANA: Well, this is great!

757
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,549
>> CYRIL: How?!

758
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:34,550
I inhaled skeleton!

759
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:35,551
>> LANA: Because now the coke...

760
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:36,552
(loud sounds of eating)

761
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,553
...is getting eaten by Pam!

762
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:38,554
Quick, make the wall spin around

763
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,722
again!

764
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:40,723
>> CYRIL: It just kind of spun

765
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:41,924
by itself!

766
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:42,925
>> ARCHER: Jesus Christ, have

767
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:43,926
you people never even heard of

768
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,094
Scooby-Doo?

769
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,295
>> KRIEGER: Oh, come on!

770
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,563
>> LANA: Of course.

771
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,731
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Uh... Pam?

772
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,932
(Pam roaring)

773
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:53,636
>> PAM: Aw, crap.

774
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,073
(Pam grunting)

775
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,308
(Cheryl/Carol laughing loudly)

776
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,576
(gasps, sad roar)

777
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:01,744
>> ARCHER (laughing): Oh, my

778
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:02,945
God.

779
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,080
That's so freakin' unsafe.

780
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,281
>> LANA: Okay, Krieger, Cyril,

781
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:06,315
get in there, and we'll spin you

782
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,316
back around. Archer...

783
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,317
>> CYRIL: Why do I have to go

784
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,585
back in there?!

785
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:10,586
>> LANA: Because I said so!

786
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:11,754
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, plus

787
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:12,955
skeletons?

788
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:14,123
>> LANA: Archer?

789
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,324
>> ARCHER: Got it.

790
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,325
>> LANA: Oh! Goddamn it!

791
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,593
>> KRIEGER: Ooh!

792
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,761
>> CYRIL: Goddamn it.

793
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:19,962
>> ARCHER: Godspeed, you

794
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,130
meddling kids.

795
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,131
>> WOODHOUSE (moaning): And sir,

796
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,132
I'm afraid your breakfast will

797
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,133
be four minutes late.

798
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,134
>> ARCHER: Yeah, duh.

799
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,335
I already berated you.

800
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,336
>> LANA: Woodhouse, get away

801
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,604
from the door!

802
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:29,772
>> WOODHOUSE: Hmm? Oh!

803
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:30,773
>> HOLLY: Goddamn it!

804
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:31,674
Just what do you people think

805
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,675
the letters FBI stand for?

806
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,642
>> ARCHER: I bought a T-shirt

807
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:34,643
once where it stood for "Female

808
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,845
Body Inspector."

809
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,846
God, is Myrtle Beach not the

810
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,114
best?

811
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,015
>> HOLLY: Pull a stunt like this

812
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,483
again, you'll never make it back

813
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,684
to Myrtle Beach.

814
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,952
>> ARCHER: I probably wasn't

815
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,120
going to anyway.

816
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,121
Turns out it's actually not the

817
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:46,288
best.

818
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,289
>> LANA: And you actually have

819
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,457
no right to search this house.

820
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,658
As you can see, there's nothing

821
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,860
illegal going on.

822
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,028
>> HOLLY: Maybe not now, but I

823
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,462
know you still have a lot of

824
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:54,697
international contacts from your

825
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,965
ISIS days.

826
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,133
Mexico, Colombia, the Orient.

827
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,334
I bet it wouldn't be too hard to

828
00:17:58,336 --> 00:17:59,535
get set up in the drug trade.

829
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,803
>> ARCHER (laughing): Well,

830
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:01,971
you'd be surp... Oh!

831
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:03,139
>> LANA: We're not drug dealers,

832
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:04,340
Agent Holly.

833
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:05,975
>> HOLLY: Good, because I'll be

834
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:08,844
watching you... like a hawk

835
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,846
that's been bred with an eagle

836
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,715
to produce some sort of...

837
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,984
eagle-eyed superhawk... with a

838
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:18,621
badge.

839
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,658
>> LANA: So, am I crazy, or is

840
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,826
he super weird?

841
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:26,162
>> ARCHER: Oh, well, I'm torn,

842
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,563
Lana, I really am.

843
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,331
I want to say "both," but I also

844
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,533
don't want you to stop my heart

845
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:31,734
again, so...

846
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,169
>> LANA: Who's da widdle baby?

847
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,336
Who's da widdle baby?

848
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:35,504
Who's da widdle baby?

849
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,173
Yes, he is, widdle, little baby!

850
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:38,374
>> CYRIL: Wait. The brain chip

851
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:39,575
is in there?

852
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,843
>> KRIEGER: I told you it was

853
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,011
small.

854
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,179
>> CYRIL: Said Ripley to the...

855
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,380
No, doesn't work there.

856
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,581
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, it's crap.

857
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,916
Okay, I actually only have one

858
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,384
brain chip, so... who's our

859
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,585
lucky winner?

860
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,187
>> CYRIL: Hmm. I guess we have

861
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:52,588
to decide if we want regular

862
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,856
lame Cheryl and a Pam who's not

863
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,024
gonna overdose on cocaine and

864
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,193
die, or potentially famous

865
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,761
country singer Cheryl and a Pam

866
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,229
who... tits.

867
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:02,765
>> KRIEGER: Flip a coin?

868
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,567
>> CYRIL: No.

869
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:05,768
>> LANA: And, yeah, he's a

870
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,036
weirdo, but I think Agent

871
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,204
Holly's right.

872
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,405
We do have a lot of

873
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,606
international connections.

874
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,607
>> ARCHER: So, I'm thinking I

875
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,608
should take a trip down old

876
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,210
Mexico way, maybe Colombia, or

877
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:17,046
even Southeast Asia, or...

878
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:18,214
Hey, where's Ron?

879
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,415
>> MALORY: Never heard of him.

880
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,616
>> LANA: Um...

881
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,884
>> ARCHER: Lana, let it go.

882
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,052
Jesus.

883
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:24,220
>> MALORY: But maybe we should

884
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:25,421
try to sell out to an

885
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:28,390
international cartel.

886
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:29,558
But let me be clear.

887
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,759
You won't be gallivanting around

888
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:31,961
under the pretense of work just

889
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,229
to visit the fleshpots of the

890
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,396
world.

891
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,564
This isn't ISIS.

892
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,765
>> ARCHER: No, I...

893
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:37,967
>> MALORY: And it definitely

894
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,235
isn't your semester abroad.

895
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:40,402
>> ARCHER: What?!

896
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,570
Come on, that's...

897
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,771
Hey, I don't think we need to go

898
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:43,939
into all the...

899
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,141
>> MALORY: Cobra whiskey and

900
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,308
ladyboys. I mean...

901
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,576
>> LANA: Ha!

902
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:48,744
>> ARCHER: Shut up.

903
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:49,945
>> MALORY: You shut up!

904
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,147
And Krieger?

905
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,148
I trust the brain-chip implant

906
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,315
was a success?

907
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,583
>> KRIEGER: I think. I mean,

908
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,618
it's in there, and she's alive.

909
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,819
Now we just have to see if there

910
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,588
were any adverse side effects.

911
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,124
(loud yawning)

912
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,292
>> LANA: Uh... Cheryl?

913
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:04,493
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Nah, Cheryl's

914
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,761
gone.

915
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,496
I'm Cherlene now.

916
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,632
And if somebody don't fry me six

917
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,433
goddamn eggs and some Carolina

918
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:12,801
fries, I would personally be

919
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,003
shocked-- shocked, I tell you--

920
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,271
if by mornin' this place ain't

921
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:17,273
burnt to the ground.

922
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:20,876
(loud yawning)

923
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:25,948
>> KRIEGER: And I'm not a

924
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,117
I mean, I'm definitely a doctor,

925
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,121
so... no, I think we're good.

926
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,856
Yup, yup, yup.
