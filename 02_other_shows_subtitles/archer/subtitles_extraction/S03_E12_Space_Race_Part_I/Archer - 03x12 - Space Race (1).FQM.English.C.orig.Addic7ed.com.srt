1
00:00:01,911 --> 00:00:05,413
KELLOGG: Mayday mayday mayday,
this is Commander Kellogg of

2
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,248
I.S.A. Space Station Horizon, [garbled]

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,282
secure transmission [garbled]

4
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:11,283
Commander Drake.

5
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:15,352
Tony, the crew has [garbled],
and we are under [garbled].

6
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:18,857
I say again, we are under [garbled].

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:23,328
Croatoooooan!

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,230
DRAKE: And that, Mrs. Archer...
MALORY: Ms.

9
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:26,698
ARCHER: Don't.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,136
DRAKE: Ahh -- Ms. Archer, I beg your pardon --
ARCHER: Don't.

11
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:33,039
DRAKE: -- that was the last
transmission from the Horizon.

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,008
ARCHER: Which, obviously pretty vague.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,947
DRAKE: Vague?!

14
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,979
You heard Commander Kellogg, he
said the Horizon is under attack!

15
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,548
LANA: Well, under something...
ARCHER: He could've been saying underfinanced.

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,082
DRAKE: What?

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,652
MALORY: Sterling -- ARCHER: What, they're
always whining about needing more

18
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,621
money for their boondocks.

19
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:48,388
LANA: Doggles.

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:48,922
ARCHER: What?

21
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,758
DRAKE: You think space
exploration is a boondoggle?!

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,627
LANA: Well c'mon, in this economy?

23
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:54,761
DRAKE: Exactly!

24
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,264
Now, more than ever, is when
we need to look to space

25
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,500
for the solutions to
mankind's problems.

26
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:04,504
In just two hundred years,
Earth's population will exceed

27
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,672
her capacity to produce enough food.

28
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:10,709
And even as the famines begin,
global war will erupt as fresh

29
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,345
water becomes scarcer than gold.

30
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:18,616
But if we begin now, using the lessons
learned aboard Space Station Horizon,

31
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:22,688
a small group of brave
colonists, can terraform Mars.

32
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,292
And mankind can finally slip
the surly bonds of Earth,

33
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,496
to live forever among the stars!

34
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:31,563
ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

35
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:32,130
LANA: Wh-?

36
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,832
ARCHER: Jesus, read a
book once in your life.

37
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:36,267
So where does ISIS fit in, Commander?

38
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,736
DRAKE: Well -- MALORY: Well I think
that's a bit premature, until we discuss

39
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:40,272
our fee structure.

40
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,907
DRAKE: As to that, you
can name your price.

41
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,510
LANA: Oh now they've got --
MALORY: Enough!

42
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:48,213
Commander? As to our role?

43
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,382
DRAKE: Horizon has an
international crew.

44
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:54,854
American, German, Chinese, French--
ARCHER: Ba-dum-bump!

45
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:56,856
Sorry, I thought "French"

46
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:00,059
was a joke DRAKE: Is mutiny
funny to you, Mr. Archer?

47
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,897
ARCHER: I dunno, maybe a mutiny of clowns...
DRAKE: Because I fear that one

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,566
faction, led by radical
nationalists, has mutinied.

49
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:07,300
LANA: But who?

50
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:07,835
Which one?

51
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,337
DRAKE: Well if I --
ARCHER: If he knew, he would tell us!

52
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:10,971
MALORY: Read a book!

53
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,141
DRAKE: And since I don't know which
faction is behind the mutiny --

54
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:17,678
LANA: If there even was one...
DRAKE: -- I can't trust anyone at the I.S.A.

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,579
Which is why I came to ISIS.

56
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,347
MALORY: Because of our loyalty.

57
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,748
DRAKE: Or lack thereof.

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,049
MALORY: Or whatever.

59
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,552
DRAKE: Because I need a small
cadre of highly trained agents

60
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:29,655
to fly into orbit and help me
to retake control of Horizon.

61
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:30,522
LANA: Nooope!

62
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:31,457
ARCHER: Yeahhhp!

63
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,090
LANA: Archer!

64
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:32,691
ARCHER: Lana!

65
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,959
LANA: He just said "highly-trained"!

66
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,762
And last time I checked, none of us were
even lowly-trained to be astronauts!

67
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,330
ARCHER: Well how hard could it be?

68
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:40,164
DRAKE: Incredibly.

69
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,835
MALORY: But since apparently money is no object...
DRAKE: The training schedule

70
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,305
will have to be highly compressed,
because the shuttle Intrepid is

71
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,973
launching in three days.

72
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,709
And I won't lie to you, this
mission will be dangerous.

73
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:54,646
ARCHER: Would you say we'll be
venturing into a zone of danger?

74
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,315
DRAKE: Well yes, obviously.

75
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,517
ARCHER: No, but -- how
would you phrase that?

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,435
DRAKE: I -- the zone
will be one of danger?

77
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:06,002
ARCHER: No, I mean say --
oh forget it, never mind.

78
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,027
And you never mind and also shut up.

79
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:18,421

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,301
ARCHER: Oww!

81
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,270
Jesus Krieger, that's the bone!

82
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,926
KRIEGER: Oh, da mean doctor take widdle
baby's bwud, and widdle baby goes --

83
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:52,393
owww!

84
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,994
ARCHER: You're a baby.

85
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,929
And astronaut training
sucks complete ass!

86
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,430
Literally!

87
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,432
What is the deal with all the enemas?!

88
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,269
KRIEGER: Uh --
ARCHER: And why do you need so much blood?!

89
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,637
And wait, now that I think about it --
DRAKE: Why is this man in

90
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,872
the restricted area?!

91
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,507
KRIEGER: Who, him?

92
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,408
DRAKE: You.

93
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,609
ARCHER: Wh-? Krieger!

94
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,978
KRIEGER: Uh -- smoke bomb!

95
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,013
DRAKE: And why aren't you
with the other trainees?

96
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,183
ARCHER: I was told I had to
undergo a bunch of extremely

97
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,584
invasive medical tests.

98
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:20,987
DRAKE: Well normally you
would, but by our doctors.

99
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,589
But since you're on such an
accelerated training schedule --

100
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,525
ARCHER: Six enemas is a luxury
we can ill afford, got it.

101
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:27,393
MALORY: Six?!

102
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:29,562
ARCHER: Or -- who knows,
he put me under.

103
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:30,029
Maybe twelve.

104
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:33,500
DRAKE: Now you've wasted half a day,
so the other trainees are way

105
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:33,867
ahead of you.

106
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:36,937
ARCHER: Not for long they're not!

107
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,472
[loud crash]

108
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,508
DRAKE: Well he's eager,
I'll give him that.

109
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,410
MALORY: Well, you inspire him.

110
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,414
With all those medals
on that powerful chest.

111
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,051
Your wife is a very lucky--
DRAKE: I'm a widower.

112
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,018
MALORY: Oh!

113
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,588
Difficult to meet people,
isn't it, in jobs like ours.

114
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,064
I only mention it because I also happen
to be single -- DRAKE: Yes, I know.

115
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:01,310
Excuse me.

116
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,674
MALORY: I hope to God that was alcohol.

117
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:11,475
LANA: No!

118
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:11,875
ARCHER: Yes!

119
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,944
LANA: Dammit Archer, it's--
ARCHER: It's my turn!

120
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,512
Cyril! Cyril!

121
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,047
Drake said lemme fly it!

122
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,016
CYRIL: Cut it out, Archer!

123
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,418
I'm landing!

124
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,722
C'mon, baby, keep that nose up...
[SMASH]

125
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,857
CYRIL: What the --?!

126
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,591
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

127
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,625
Explosive decompression.

128
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,826
Explosive decompression.

129
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,727
ARCHER: Happy, Cyril?!

130
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,963
You just destroyed Alderaan!

131
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,332
LANA: Dammit, that was closer than any
of us have gotten to actually landing!

132
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:40,169
ARCHER: A, because you're all crap, and
B, who cares, we're not gonna land it!

133
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,438
CYRIL: What the hell --
DRAKE: -- is going on in here?!

134
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,474
LANA: Archer --
ARCHER: Saw an electrical fire in the simulator,

135
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,277
and knowing that my colleague's
life was in danger, I --

136
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,279
DRAKE: You acted without thinking!

137
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:50,913
LANA: As always.

138
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:54,785
ARCHER: Not always...
DRAKE: Well, thank God you did -- LANA: Wh-?

139
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,552
ARCHER: But almost always!

140
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,322
DRAKE: -- because that's exactly
the kind of decisive action

141
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,723
this mission calls for.

142
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,760
You could all learn something from him.

143
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,163
EVERYBODY: Oh my God...
DRAKE: Starting with a little training exercise we

144
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:11,102
lightheartedly call... The Vomit Comet!

145
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,706
And if you're wondering why we call it that...
LANA: [huge retch]

146
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,340
GILLETTE: Gagh!

147
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,441
Aw, it's all in my hair!

148
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,910
CYRIL: Oh Jeezy H. Petes!

149
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,744
ARCHER: What the hell is
wrong with you, Lana?!

150
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,346
DRAKE:... that's why we call it that.

151
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:27,017
LANA: What possible reason, could there
be, to subject human beings to --

152
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:33,057
SKEWWWWWWW...
ARCHER: Such mind-shattering awesomeness!

153
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:39,363
DRAKE: The KC-135 flies in a parabolic arc--
ARCHER: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo caaaaaaaaaares!

154
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,368
DRAKE: -- which allows us to achieve
weightlessness for about thirty seconds.

155
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,706
We'll do this twenty times --
ARCHER: Woooooo! Weightlessness!

156
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,975
DRAKE: -- so you can get acquainted
with the sensation of being weightless.

157
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,645
It takes some time getting used to, but --
CYRIL: Ow.

158
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,913
DRAKE: Agent Kane.

159
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,981
Are you alright?

160
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,681
LANA: Yep.

161
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,649
Yep yep yep.

162
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,617
GILLETTE: What is going on with you?

163
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,452
LANA: Do not like.

164
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,519
GILLETTE: What're you, crazy?

165
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,521
What's not to --
LANA: [huge retch]

166
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,255
GILLETTE: Oh.

167
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,090
CYRIL: No! Archer, noooo!

168
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:07,724
ARCHER: Yeesss!

169
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:10,193
CYRIL: Please don't do this!

170
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,529
ARCHER: What's that?
Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the

171
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:17,768
sound of the vawshiiiit!

172
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,802
DRAKE: Looking good!

173
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,805
Only nineteen more to go!

174
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:26,075
LANA: Nineteen more times...
Until there was literally

175
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,512
no more fluid left in my body.

176
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,447
CYRIL: Yeah, and thanks
so much for that.

177
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,850
LANA: Cyril...
ARCHER: She's not the one who kept riding you into it

178
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,218
holding your mouth open.

179
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,423
CYRIL: Jeez, even in zero gravity you're
an assho -- ARCHER: You were saying?

180
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,159
To the wet-towel wielding
survivor of fifteen years of

181
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,095
boarding school locker rooms?

182
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:44,162
LANA: Wait, fifteen?

183
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,998
ARCHER: Or -- whatever,
the normal number.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,932
LANA: Twelve?!

185
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,700
DRAKE: Yes, we will
launch in twelve hours.

186
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,269
We received another
transmission from the Horizon.

187
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,137
They can't wait.

188
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,805
LANA: But we haven't
been trained properly!

189
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,473
ARCHER: To what, wear a seat belt?

190
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,375
Actually, is it a
five-point harness, or...?

191
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,744
DRAKE: I admit this isn't an ideal scenario --
LANA: Speaking of,

192
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,246
what's the scenario when
we get to the Horizon?

193
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,716
We don't have a tactical plan, we don't--
DRAKE: We'll have plenty of time

194
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,840
to discuss our plan of
action during the flight.

195
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,734
LANA: But --
MALORY: Lana!

196
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,286
What has gotten in to you?

197
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,890
CYRIL: More like what got out of her...
GILLETTE: Sir, I'm not sure Lana-

198
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,826
sorry honey - is physically
capable of spaceflight.

199
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,161
LANA: Ray!

200
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,763
Actually I may not be cut out for it.

201
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:25,088
DRAKE: I'm sorry to hear that, Agent Kane...
Because you're going.

202
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:37,089
ARCHER: [chuckling] To a zone,
which is one of danger.

203
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,452
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
T-minus ninety seconds.

204
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:47,202
DRAKE: Roger, Control,
all systems are go.

205
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,003
Next stop, Horizon.

206
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,701
Okay. Archer.

207
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,970
ARCHER: Sorry, are you talking to me?

208
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,273
Or to her, who why is she here?!

209
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,941
MALORY: Because Tony invited me!

210
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:57,809
ARCHER: Tony?!

211
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,079
What, you trying to get my mother
into the Million-Mile High Club?!

212
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,913
MALORY: Sterling!

213
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,982
DRAKE: Archer...
GILLETTE: Would you calm the hell down?!

214
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:04,782
ARCHER: I am calm!

215
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:05,917
And I'm also outta here!

216
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,985
DRAKE: Take your hands
off that harness.

217
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:08,686
ARCHER: Make me!

218
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,421
Oh, and just so you know?!

219
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:13,090
She -- Can't breathe.

220
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,325
MISSION CONTROL: Uh, Flight,
we're showing suit number two

221
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:16,527
with an oh-two malfunction.

222
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,362
DRAKE: Double-check that, Control,
I'm showing green across the board.

223
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,697
MISSION CONTROL: Stand by.

224
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,833
DRAKE: Roger, standing by.

225
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,468
Doo do doooo...
MALORY: Tony, please!

226
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,569
He'll behave!

227
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,470
Won't he!

228
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:28,737
ARCHER: Ip.

229
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:33,709
DRAKE: Excellent... Because I won't-
I can't - let anyone jeopardize the

230
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,078
success of this mission.

231
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,248
MISSION CONTROL: Flight, oh-two
on suit two is showing normal.

232
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,717
But uh, keep an eye on it.

233
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,420
DRAKE: Oh, I will.

234
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,455
ARCHER: Hooray...
DRAKE: Resume countdown, Control.

235
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,590
MISSION CONTROL: Roger, Flight.

236
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:48,927
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE: T-minus five... four...
DRAKE: Exciting, isn't it?

237
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,695
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:
Three.

238
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:51,329
Two.

239
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:51,896
One.

240
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:52,764
DRAKE: I think it is.

241
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,731
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

242
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,132
Ignition.

243
00:09:55,134 --> 00:10:00,070
MISSION CONTROL: Liftoff.

244
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,573
DRAKE: Just relax, and
rely on your training!

245
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,508
LANA: Which we didn't have!

246
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,610
DRAKE: Because Phase
Two's a little rough!

247
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:07,678
ARCHER: Phase Two?!

248
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,579
What's Phase -- [BOOOOM!]

249
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:17,153
EVERYBODY: Aaaaaaghhhhh!

250
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:18,955
DRAKE: That was Phase Two.

251
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:20,557
LANA: Did not like.

252
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,359
DRAKE: Wait'll you see Phase Three.

253
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,228
EVERYBODY: What?

254
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,598
DRAKE: I'm kidding, there
is no Phase Three.

255
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,865
Just a little space-humor.

256
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,534
ARCHER: Yeah, funny stuff.

257
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,603
DRAKE: Right?

258
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:34,806
Right, then... I want to brief you
all on we can expect when we dock

259
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,007
with Horizon.

260
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,443
LANA: Ugh, can we expect a pharmacy?

261
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,178
ARCHER: Lana, it's not a strip mall.

262
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,113
Although I assume there's a bar?

263
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:42,781
DRAKE: A bar?

264
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,716
ARCHER: Or whatever, cantina.

265
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:45,884
DRAKE: Ah... No.

266
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,786
Please pay attention.

267
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:51,490
We'll dock here, move forward on foot
toward Horizon's bridge, and --

268
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:52,591
CYRIL: Wait, on foot?

269
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:55,360
DRAKE: Horizon has artificial gravity.

270
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:58,030
See how it spins on its
longitudinal axis?

271
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,332
ARCHER: Lana, look at it spin.

272
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,636
DRAKE: When we reach the bridge,
we'll retake control of Horizon.

273
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:07,706
But we can expect heavy resistance,
I'm sure the mutineers are armed.

274
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,775
ARCHER: With what,
slide rules and Tang?

275
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:14,313
DRAKE: The M-41 Mark Two plasma-pulse
rifle with concussion grenade launcher.

276
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:15,648
EVERYBODY: Oh shit!

277
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,719
DRAKE: On "kill" mode, the M-41
fires lethal plasma ammunition.

278
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,255
On "stun" it fires an ion pulse.

279
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:23,789
Similar to an EMP.

280
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,992
ARCHER: And can it be
fired with an erection?

281
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:26,392
MALORY: Ugh.

282
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,860
LANA: Archer! Muzzle?!

283
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,428
ARCHER: Relax, it's on stun Lana.

284
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,263
DRAKE: Careful.

285
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:35,635
Even on stun it can --
ARCHER: Oops.

286
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:36,069
DRAKE: Clear!

287
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,371
LANA: Clear! GILLETTE: Clear!

288
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,974
CYRIL: Owwwwwww!

289
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:45,445
DRAKE: Whew! As I was saying, it's possible
for the EMP to stop a man's heart.

290
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,846
ARCHER: So "stun,"

291
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:48,748
maybe a bit of a misnomer.

292
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,618
CYRIL: Dammit, Archer...
ARCHER: I'm not the one who was all sweaty!

293
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,255
DRAKE: Mr. Archer, that's twice you've
jeopardized the success of this mission!

294
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,690
There will not be a third!

295
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,726
MISSION CONTROL: Uh, Flight,
we have a problem...

296
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:04,398
ARCHER: Well don't look at me...
DRAKE: My God, on this trajectory we'll miss

297
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,299
Horizon!

298
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,433
Control, what happened?!

299
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:11,238
MISSION CONTROL: Burn rates were
good, Flight, uh... stand by.

300
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,475
Uh, Flight, we're showing that
you are grossly overweight.

301
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:15,643
PAM: Oh, for --!

302
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,477
I wouldn't say grossly!

303
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,745
CHERYL/CAROL: I would.

304
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:23,550
DRAKE: I would be well within my rights
to jettison both of you into space!

305
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:24,751
MALORY: Well within them!

306
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:25,385
LANA: Malory!

307
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,152
DRAKE: However!

308
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:31,524
For uh, numerous reasons - one being
this ship can't actually do that -

309
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:33,159
I've decided take you with us.

310
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,294
EVERYBODY: [Sigh of relief]

311
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,330
DRAKE: But I want to
know how you got aboard.

312
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,065
PAM: Whaddya mean, how?

313
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:43,405
Mr. Ar --
ARCHER: Yeah so that safety's tricky, huh?

314
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:43,839
DRAKE: Clear!

315
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:46,008
LANA: Clear! GILLETTE: Clear!

316
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,544
PAM: Owwwwwww!

317
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:53,649
CHERYL/CAROL: Awesome...
PAM: Son of a shitsnackin whore... DRAKE: Mr. Figgis!

318
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,753
Lock that man in the cargo hold.

319
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:58,554
ARCHER: Who, me?

320
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,289
CYRIL: Aye freaking aye.

321
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,557
DRAKE: Ms. Archer.

322
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,226
MALORY: In case I need
to sterilize something?

323
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:05,427
DRAKE: Get strapped in.

324
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,062
Agent Gillette, monitor
this woman's vital signs.

325
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,764
Agent Kane, come with me.

326
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,333
I may need some help
getting us to Horizon.

327
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,371
So that we don't die writhing in
agony when we run out of oxygen.

328
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,841
ARCHER: Yeah, been there, no picnic.

329
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:21,277
Speaking of, great for picnics.

330
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,880
The tofu teriyaki, not so much.

331
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,949
PAM: There's teriyaki?

332
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:26,850
CYRIL: No!

333
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:28,152
ARCHER: Cyril, c'mon, lemme out.

334
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:28,786
CYRIL: No, you jerk!

335
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:31,622
You shoot me in the heart with a
space-blaster... ARCHER: Wh-?!

336
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,691
You're still mad about that?!

337
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:37,995
CYRIL: Not to mention whatever idiot
reason you had for smuggling Pam on board!

338
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,497
GILLETTE: You're screwin
him, aren'tcha?

339
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,032
PAM: Whaaaaaaaat?

340
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:42,633
Yes.

341
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:43,467
CYRIL: No!

342
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,704
Because if we don't die, for all
I care you can rot in there!

343
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,106
ARCHER: Cyril?! Cyril!

344
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:58,049
Well good luck fighting a bunch of
whatever, space-pirates without me.

345
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:01,018
[BEEP] you, space.

346
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,436
DRAKE: Come on baby,
just a few more seconds!

347
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,271
Damn it!

348
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:15,367
I don't know if that was
a long enough burn!

349
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:18,504
Agent Kane, I need a readout!

350
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,674
For God's sake, woman, Dramamine!

351
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,510
LANA: It makes me sleepy...
CYRIL: I think we're okay, sir!

352
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,845
DRAKE: Thank God.

353
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,780
Because we're out of fuel.

354
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,414
CHERYL/CAROL: What?!

355
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,150
How are we gonna get back to Earth?!

356
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,052
DRAKE: There is fuel.

357
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:32,086
On Horizon.

358
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,021
CHERYL/CAROL: Well I didn't know that.

359
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,623
DRAKE: The flight computer
will dock the ship.

360
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,991
Assemble the boarding party.

361
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,194
CHERYL/CAROL: Nor was I told
there would be a party.

362
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,295
Lana, what're you wearing?

363
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,931
DRAKE: Bio-matrix composite body armor.

364
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,500
Effective against small-arms fire.

365
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,669
And we need all the help we can get.

366
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,271
GILLETTE: Since there's
only four of us.

367
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,840
CYRIL: Yeah, that seems kinda... few.

368
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,875
PAM: Heck, if you need some help, I'll --
DRAKE: No!

369
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:55,845
We can't jeopardize the women!

370
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:56,745
LANA: Cough.

371
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:58,613
MALORY: Well not you...
DRAKE: No, no, no, Agent Kane,

372
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,950
I'm afraid your particular skill-set
outweighs your --

373
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,052
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE: Docking complete.

374
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,220
CHERYL/CAR: Is that a ghost?

375
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:06,754
PAM: Nope.

376
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,489
DRAKE: Boarding party,
into the airlock.

377
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,256
SEXY ROBOTIC VOICE:

378
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:10,725
Gravity engaged.

379
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:13,728
DRAKE: Weapons on stun, fast
and hard to the bridge.

380
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,630
And remember, these are mutineers.

381
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:25,341
Even if they try to say --
CYRIL: Suppressing fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!

382
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,909
DRAKE: Otherwise.

383
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:27,710
Just follow me.

384
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:30,513
LANA: And try not to
shoot me in the awshit!

385
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:31,381
GILLETTE: What the hell.

386
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,582
LANA: Is wrong with me?

387
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,484
DRAKE: It's the artificial gravity!

388
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,219
You have to readjust to it!

389
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:39,855
LANA: I'll get my inner ear right on that...
DRAKE: We don't have time

390
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,557
for this, they're --
HORIZON DRONE: There they are!

391
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,291
Get 'em, get 'em!

392
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:42,991
Drop your weapons!

393
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:44,125
Drop your weapons!

394
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:51,298
CYRIL: Suppressing -- So does
this run on batteries, or...?

395
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,403
DRAKE: Fiiiiire!

396
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:59,241
EVERYBODY: Get some! Get some!

397
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,742
DRAKE: We're pinned down!

398
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:01,944
LANA: Really?

399
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,480
CHERYL/CAROL: You don't
think I could rock this?

400
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:08,350
MALORY: Couple things...
One, I don't know what that means.

401
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:11,421
And two... hang on.

00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:13,523
Hang on.

00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,859
Hang on.

404
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:23,031
Hang on.

405
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,834
And two, you obviously don't know
what "boarding party" means.

406
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:31,105
CHERYL/CAROL: Who am I, sixteenth-century
female Irish pirate Grinne O'Malley?

407
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,607
Or her sole female descendant!

408
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,808
ARCHER: I'm sorry.

409
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,342
PAM: For what?

410
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,811
Space-blastering me in
the frickin tits?!

411
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,980
Or tricking me into that
fart-locker to get blasted into

412
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:45,386
outer goddamn space on the off
chance you might wanna bang me!

ARCHER: Both I guess, look --
PAM: After you blew me off

414
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,826
for Katya the big-titted cyborg!

415
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:53,895
Littleiss, uh...
ARCHER: R2-double-D2?

416
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:54,863
PAM: Nice.

417
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,999
ARCHER: Thanks, and I'm sorry,
but you gotta let me out, Pam,

418
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:00,368
they're fighting
space-pirates out there!

419
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,336
With Cyril!

420
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,038
CYRIL: It's supposed to fire.

421
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,573
What is wrong with you?

422
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,475
ARCHER: And Lana can't even stand up!

00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:10,711
LANA: You idiot, just
reset the -- unghff!

GILLETTE: Jesus, like a

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,781
DRAKE: No, no!

426
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,350
We're losing the beachhead!

427
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,218
ARCHER: They're running
out of time, Pam!

428
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:25,659
PAM: Oh, alright...
ARCHER: That being said... quickie?

429
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:28,461
PAM: Meh.

430
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:29,428
Whew!

431
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,696
Okay, good luck.

432
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,598
ARCHER: Thanks, normally
I'd say I don't need it,

433
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,467
but I can barely feel my legs.

434
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,469
PAM: I call that the MOAB.

435
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,104
It stands for --
ARCHER: I know!

00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:41,240
What it stands for, I was there,
please don't say it out loud.

437
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:49,115
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to...
Kick some space-pirate ass!

438
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:49,983
Woooooo!

439
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,817
EVERYBODY: Archer?!

440
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,718
ARCHER: Hang on?

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,020
Yes, Archer, duh.

442
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:57,325
And if you're done doing each other's hair, let's --
DRAKE: Let's retake the shiiiiip!

443
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,128
ARCHER: Or just run around
interrupting people.

444
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,030
DRAKE: Gagh! I'm hit, I'm hit!

445
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:06,301
ARCHER: Oh, for -- Do I
have to do everything?

446
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:09,604
He asked, intending to be facetious!

447
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:10,305
LANA: I'm sorry!

448
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,940
I don't know what's wrong with me!

449
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,141
ARCHER: Besides suffering
from gigantism?!

450
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,909
LANA: Shut up.

451
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,609
DRAKE: The bridge!

We have to make it to the --
ARCHER: The bridge, yes, I heard you!

00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:21,079
So unless we're going the wrong way...!

DRAKE: Uhh... oh.

No, that's it right there.

456
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:25,383
ARCHER: Then shut up! God!

457
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:26,383
Okay, now what?

458
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,317
You can un-shut up.

459
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,020
DRAKE: The com-link, by the door...
Commander Kellogg?

460
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:31,720
It's Drake!

461

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,223
ARCHER: "Tony?!"

KELLOGG: Oh my God,
am I glad to see you!

00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:38,760
We couldn't have held out much longer!

00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:41,262
DRAKE: Well, we got here
as fast as we could.

KELLOGG: My God, you're wounded.

00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,200
Put him here, please, and we'll take those...
ARCHER: Uh, oh.

468
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:49,536
Yeah, here you go...
KELLOGG: Oh dear, are you wounded too?

469
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:51,938
LANA: No, just --
DRAKE: Just a little space-sickness.

470
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,673
But eventually she'll get acclimated.

471
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,475
LANA: I -- eventually?

472
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:58,444
KELLOGG: Yes, she's strong,
good breeding stock.

473
00:18:58,446 --> 00:18:59,312
LANA: Wh-?! Hey!

474
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,582
ARCHER: Whoa, Charles
Benedict Davenport.

475
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:04,884
Uh, the father of eugenics.

476
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:06,252
Seriously guys, read a book.

477
00:19:06,254 --> 00:19:10,823
DRAKE: And two more on the Intrepid,
stowaways, almost as good as her.

478
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:11,790
KELLOGG: Two more?!

479
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,193
Then we can populate Mars
even faster than we'd hoped!

480
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,094
CYRIL: What? GILLETTE: What?

481
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,795
LANA: Did you say Mars?!

482
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:21,298
ARCHER: Oh now your ears --
wait, why did you say Mars?

483
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,402
HORIZON DRONE: Don't you see?

484
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:27,591
They're the mutineers!

485
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:38,206
DRAKE: Welcome to the... Danger Zone!

486
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:49,320
