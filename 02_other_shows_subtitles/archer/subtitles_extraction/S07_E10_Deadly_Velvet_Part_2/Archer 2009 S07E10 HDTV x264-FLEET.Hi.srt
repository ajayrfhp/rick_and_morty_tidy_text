1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:03,878
DIETRICH: And so, to reiterate...

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,046
HARRIS: Due to your various
relationships with the victim,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,783
Ellis Crane, both
professional and personal...

4
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:12,653
DIETRICH: You are all persons of interest
in an active homicide investigation.

5
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:14,555
(ALL GRUMBLING)

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,458
Wait. Can't you eliminate
us by testing our hands

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,561
- for gunshot residue? Hmm?
- Wha... Y-Yes!

8
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:20,320
Yes, we can.

9
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,497
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do, smart guy.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,299
- So...
- Think you're so goddamn smart.

11
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,836
So we're gonna need everybody
to come down to the station,

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,406
so, uh, we can test your
hands for gunshot residue!

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,808
Yeah, hi. Alan Shapiro,
attorney for Veronica Deane?

14
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,912
- God, she is so great!
- Huge fan. Huge!

15
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,680
- Ohhh!
- Yeah. Super.

16
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:41,849
But my client will not be
frog-marched into a police station

17
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,418
like a common criminal before
God knows how many cameras,

18
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:47,087
every one of which was
tipped off by the LAPD!

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,589
I-I... Well, no. No. (COUGHS)

20
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:51,326
- We wouldn't want that.
- She will, however...

21
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:54,495
consent to the test being
conducted at my office.

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,263
Thank you. That's very accommodating.

23
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,265
Get a load of Obi-Wan-Attorney.

24
00:00:58,298 --> 00:00:59,867
So, should we head there now, or...

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,336
No, let's say tomorrow. Elevenish?

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,272
- Elevenish it is!
- Looking forward to it.

27
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,107
- Are you kidding me?
- How is that fair?

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,843
- Why does she get special treatment?
- Because she is special.

29
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:12,280
- She's... a movie star!
- Yeah. Because she's special.

30
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,016
Well, I don't really want to go down
to the police station either, so...

31
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,618
Goddamn it! You will comply!

32
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:20,287
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey...
It's all good, buddy!

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,456
She's comin' down to the station.

34
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,292
- Comin' down to the station, right?
- Uh, yup.

35
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,795
See? She's comin' down to the station.

36
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:29,798
Yeah! 'Cause I remember you, Lana Kane.

37
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,633
You're still on probation for the
gun charge and the stalking.

38
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,968
- It was a hamentashen!
- Yeah.

39
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,970
Well, you're not gonna "yummy Jewish
cookies" your way out of this one.

40
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,239
Ah! I couldn't have murdered Ellis.

41
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,141
I was in Veronica's dressing room
ripping Archer like a rented mule!

42
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,911
(LAUGHS) Oh, man, you never rent a mule.

43
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,913
- So wait a second...
- You lease that surly bastard.

44
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:47,716
- Shut up! So wait...
- Shut up!

45
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:51,085
So, your alibi is that you were
busy committing felony assault.

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,920
- Yes!
- She's a real menace.

47
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,823
Shut up, and they all saw me.

48
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,557
- I didn't.
- What?

49
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,492
Yes, you did! I was right there!

50
00:01:58,526 --> 00:01:59,828
- Nope.
- You little...

51
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,829
- Shapiro! You saw me!
- Did I?

52
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:03,431
- What?
- Because what I don't see...

53
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,667
is how that helps my
client, Veronica Deane.

54
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:06,900
- (GASPS) - Huge fan.
- So great.

55
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:09,069
- Archer...
- Yes, Lana?

56
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,006
Would you care to tell the detectives...

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,740
that I couldn't have killed Ellis...

58
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,842
because I was busy beating your ass?

59
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,911
- I would love to.
- (DEEP SIGH)

60
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,079
- There. See?
- Unfortunately...

61
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:19,939
Goddamn it!

62
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,417
I must have gotten a
bonk on the noggin,

63
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,286
- because I can't remember anything!
- Ohahhh!

64
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:27,521
So, Miss Kane, you can ride with me...

65
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,024
I'll call a van for the rest of you.

66
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,358
And remain with you in a
supervisory capacity.

67
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:36,397
- Because. Whatever you do...
- You are not to wash your hands!

68
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:42,838
Uhmm...

69
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,541
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

70
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,271
Yeah, so listen. The
whole thing about...

71
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:25,366
not washing our hands...

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,537
But, darling, they were so terribly
goopy from our love-making!

73
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,371
Which was so wonderful, darling.

74
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:32,775
Wasn't it just... so... wonderful.

75
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,043
Well, yeah. I mean, it almost always is,

76
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:37,145
both wonderful and goopy, but...

77
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:40,315
But, darling, surely you don't think
that I could have murdered Ellis?

78
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:44,219
- No! I mean... you know...
- After all, he was killed at 2:14,

79
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:47,555
and I was in here with you, until
almost the very stroke of 3:00.

80
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,892
Which you were extremely clear about.

81
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,559
And repeatedly, come to think of it.

82
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:54,295
- But there's no clock in here, so...
- What do you think...

83
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,165
about... Mexico?

84
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:58,400
Like, their extradition treaty, or...

85
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:00,802
No, you goose. As a romantic getaway!

86
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:04,172
Oh. Well, then, theoretically,
me gusto mucho.

87
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,148
But...

88
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,975
I have a fabulous
bungalow in Las Caletas.

89
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:10,578
- Just down the beach from John Huston.
- Really?

90
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,580
Hmm. You could hit his
house with a coconut.

91
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,015
Which I've always wanted to do.

92
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,751
We could be there in four hours.

93
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:19,754
Is... But is now a great time,
or even a not very bad time?

94
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,823
What with the whole
murder investigation...

95
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,424
Oh, Alan can handle that.

96
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,993
But until all the fuss dies down,

97
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,929
we could swim in the ocean...

98
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:30,765
swim in tequila, dance naked
on the beach by firelight...

99
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,001
Prank John Huston with some coconuts...

100
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,604
Besides, it looks like that enormous
Lana Kane person is the real killer.

101
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:39,041
What? No, I-I shouldn't
have joked about that.

102
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,710
- I'll tell the cops she...
- She certainly had a motive.

103
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:44,178
I mean, my God, the
victim's jealous lover?

104
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:47,015
Yeah, hey, uh, you know what?
My hands are pretty goopy, too.

105
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,550
I'm just gonna pop out, give
'em a quick rinse, and...

106
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,386
Well, just use the sink here, silly.

107
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,790
- Uh, no. I have diarrhea, so...
- (KNOCKING)

108
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:57,793
Miss Deane? I have kind
of a fanboy request.

109
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,195
And you can't let those fans down!

110
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:03,131
- See, I... Oh.
- Yeah.

111
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,633
- I...
- I have diarrhea.

112
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,070
- You better not wash those hands!
- I won't!

113
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,472
- I'd like your word, please!
- You have it!

114
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:12,140
Great police work.

115
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:15,977
Seriously? What is it with
everybody washing their hands?

116
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,647
Exactly! I'm not going
to be the only chump

117
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,316
walking into that police
station with unwashed hands!

118
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,218
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, man!

119
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:26,155
- (TOILET FLUSHING)
- We gotta wash our hands?

120
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,157
What? No! They said, "Don't wash them."

121
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,091
CAROL: Wait, what are we all washing?

122
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,326
Goddamn it, wash everything!

123
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,562
Geez! Make up your mind, America!

124
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,931
And I need to talk to you. Now.

125
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,167
MALORY: All right, Grabney Coleman!
What?

126
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,102
(SIGHS) It's about the murder.

127
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:44,273
Oh, Sterling, I know exactly
what you're going to say.

128
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:46,909
- You do?
- And I know exactly what to do.

129
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,843
- You do.
- Sterling, it's me.

130
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,679
Of course I do, just like I knew
you were headed for trouble

131
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:54,850
the minute you laid your eyes
on that washed-up old crone.

132
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:57,019
Oh, for... She's like 50!

133
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,287
Also, maybe, a little a lot crazy.

134
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:02,924
- Oh, really? An actress?
- Who's crazy?

135
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,859
Nobody. Get out of here, Krieger!

136
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,796
- With your goddamn human breast milk.
- Okay! Geez!

137
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,364
And it's not human!

138
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:11,700
I don't know if that's better or worse.

139
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:14,268
Anyway, now I'm worried the cops might
actually think Lana did it, so...

140
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,636
Mexico.

141
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,872
Wait? Yeah. That's what she said.

142
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:21,376
Well, it's obvious. It's basically
right next door, for God's sake.

143
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,212
As if Los Angeles needed another minus.

144
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:26,982
Come... I don't know, mother.
Fleeing to Mexico?

145
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,884
It just kinda screams, "I'm guilty."

146
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:33,789
So, no one is technically fleeing,
because no one is under arrest.

147
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:34,631
Yet.

148
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:37,059
So you're saying now would
be the best time to go? If...

149
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,294
If there could ever be a "best time"

150
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:42,964
to have your picture taken with a
donkey painted to look like a zebra.

151
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:45,467
Hmm, pretty sure those are real zebras.

152
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:47,068
- Typical.
- Who's a zebra?

153
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,571
Goddamn it, Krieger. I
told you to... Wait.

154
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,740
- How did you change so fast?
- Oh! Um...

155
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:55,744
Don't engage him! You need to be on the
first mode of transport to Mexico.

156
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:58,479
Don't even bother packing,
just grab a fake passport

157
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,415
at the office and go...

158
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:03,085
But first, wash your gunpowdery hands.

159
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,852
My... Wait. You don't think I did it?

160
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:07,422
- Wh... Who else?
- Veronica!

161
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,258
- Who's Veronica? - Jesus!
- What the...

162
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,192
Why are your frickin' cyborgs here?

163
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:14,528
Because we're getting 30
bucks a day as extras! Each!

164
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,264
- Who is?
- Well, get the hell out of here.

165
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:18,833
- All of you!
- No! Now wait a minute.

166
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,602
This could actually help you!

167
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,372
To do what? Open an Adolf E. Cheese?

168
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:26,775
Krieger, you have one of these
god-awful monstrosities

169
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,110
- for each of us?
- No!

170
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:32,780
- Maybe. Yes.
- There you go! You go to Mexico,

171
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,883
your robo-doppelganger takes the fall,

172
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:37,451
you come back after he gets the chair.

173
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,021
- Ohh...
- First of all, I didn't do it!

174
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:42,290
- I doesn't matter!
- I feel like it does!

175
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,193
- It's not always about you!
- Wha... And second of all,

176
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,696
there's no way one of
these damn "inepticons"

177
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,631
could pass the fricking Turing test!

178

(SHOCKED GASPS)

179
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:53,035
Oh, they can totally
pass the Turing test.

180
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,637
What is that? A thing from Star Wars?

181
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,040
No, it's a test to see if a
machine's artificial intelligence

182
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,876
can convince a human that
the machine is also human.

183
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,580
Which they totally can. Go ahead.
Ask them anything about anything.

184
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:08,083
Ugh. Okay, uh, let's see.

185
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,318
What is love?

- Now I have to wash my hands again.
- (SHORT-CIRCUIT ZAPPING)

191
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,385
Goddamn it, this is classic Archer!

192
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,546
- Oh, yeah?
- He knows I didn't kill Ellis!

193
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,882
But he's so goddamn immature,
he thinks it's funny

194
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,285
to watch the mother of his
child hauled off to jail.

195
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,654
Which, by the way, is a
total waste of time,

196
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,390
because you are not gonna
find any gunshot residue

197
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,992
- on my hands.
- Uh, you never know.

198
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,662
No, actually, I do know, because...
I'm sorry...

199
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,298
- And that means what?
- What?

200
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,401
- You never know...
- Uh, figure of speech?

201
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,502
Oh, really? Because
from where I'm sitting,

202
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,571
which by the way is in
a black woman's skin,

203
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,740
in the back of a prowler
with no door handles

204
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,310
driven by a white cop,
it sounds like the LAPD

205
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,910
is gonna frame me for murder.

206
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,981
Like I said, "You never know!"

207
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,182
Oh, damn it!

208
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,985
No-o-o!

209
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,021
You maniac! You blew him up!

210
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:19,092
Aw, damn you! Goddamn you all to hell!

211
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,995
Oh, give it a rest.

That'll do, Milkly, that'll do.

Man down! Man down! Man down!

Man? It's basically an appliance.

- What the hell happened here?

- What's happening?
- Don't y'all know?

219
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,947
That is what I'm trying to find...
Damn it, woman!

220
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,115
I thought I told you not
to wash your hands!

221
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,951
Yeah, I'm almost positive you did.

222
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,620
Okay. Nobody move. Nobody do anything.

223
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,689
In fact, everybody put your
hands in your damn pockets!

- (PHONE RINGING)

227
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,064
Hey. Yeah, I need you to come
back to the studio real quick.

228
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,301
No, the van's not here, but it looks
like we've got another homicide...

229
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,739
Uh, just in the very brief
time since you left, yes.

230
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,807
What are ya, shootin' 'em yourself?

231
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,476
How... Uh... Okay. Shut up.
I'm almost at the station,

232
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,312
just wait for the van, dummy.

233
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,814
Well, sweetheart, today just
might be your lucky day.

234
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,082
What? You're gonna park in
an alley, and let me go

235
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,818
- if I give you a blow job?
- Mmmm... no.

236
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,988
They made us quit doing that. There
was a whole big thing about it.

237
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,825
- Then why am I suddenly so lucky?
- Because it looks like...

238
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,093
- maybe the killer struck again.
- Ha!

239
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,763
Told you! Dumbass idiot cops!

240
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,999
So, how's it feel to be such an idiot?

241
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,235
Mm, I guess... almost like
there's a vast number of things

242
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,505
that can happen to you between
now and when you're released

243
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,174
from police custody, and
almost none of them are good?

244
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,178
Um. Point. Taken.

245
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,681
Let's go, folks. Nothing to see here.

246
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:50,116
- What on earth is going on?
- Because whatever it is, my client had

247
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,019
absolutely nothing to do with it!

248
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,021
Come on, beat it! 23 skidoo!

249
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,524
Hey! You need to get your
old, tiny, fake policeman ass

250
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,794
out of my space! I'm trying
to do real policeman shit!

251
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,029
Then arrest her! For murder!

252
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,865
You can't murder a machine!

253
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,134
Yeah, that's like the
first law of robotics.

254
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,202
No, it's the exact opposite of that!

255
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,807
Well, excuse me, Dr. Han Fastolfe.

256
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,475
- Too obscure?
- I mean...

257
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,043
The point is, legally speaking,

258
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,211
a murder victim has to be a human being.

259
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,215
- That is true.
- Besides, it's your word against mine.

260
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,150
No, it isn't! Because all my K-bots

261
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,152
have a digital recorder in their CPU.

262
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,487
You can't record me
without my permission!

263
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,991
That is also true. California is
a two-party consent state, so...

264
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,728
Actually, in California, you
can record a conversation

265
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,731
without the other party's
consent, if you believe

266
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,066
- it will collect evidence of a crime.
- Aha!

267
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,402
But you didn't know a
crime was going to occur

268
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,902
when you started recording!

269
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,907
Aha! But also, isn't the question moot?

270
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:51,077
Because that dude's CPU's...
totally dickholed.

271
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,314
Aha! But his CPU is working perfectly!

272
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,918
- And he witnessed everything! Copley?
- Yep, yep, yep!

273
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,322
Please rewind to Milkly's heinous
murder and play it back for us.

274
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,591
- All righty...
- None of this is admissible!

275
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:05,426
And more importantly, they're robots.

276
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,260

Aw, thank God. Okay. Gunshot

282
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,611
shall set you free!

Or not. But get in that van!

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,350
- With the exception of my client!
- Of course.

285
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,952
(LAUGHS) Absolutely. And
thank you for the autograph.

286
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,055
That was so great, and you're just...
so great!

287
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,024
And this is all a huge waste of time.

288
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,961
(CHUCKLES) Well, yes! Because
it's so totally obvious

289
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,696
that Lana Kane murdered Ellis.

290
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,964
Uh, hang on. Actually...

291
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,132
As a matter of fact, Mr. Shapiro will be

292
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,701
presenting you evidence of Miss
Kane's guilt tomorrow morning.

293
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,538
- He what? - Do what?
- I what?

294
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,807
- Isn't that what you told me?
- Uh, yes?

295
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,543
So, Detective. See you at elevenish?

296
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,479
Oh, yes. (LAUGHING) Yes.

297
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,981
So great. The rest of
you, asses in the van!

298
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,485
- You'd better do something.
- Let's go! Come on!

299
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,053
- Get in there!
- But, Veronica, what about Mexico?

300
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,822
We may not need to go, after all.

301
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,057
But the coconuts. The naked tequila.

302
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,260
- Can't we at least talk about it?
- All right, darling. Calm down.

tonight, and we'll talk.

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,665
Yo! Faceman! In the van! Now!

305
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,101
Okay. There's a nice way to do that.

306
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,603
See ya tonight.

307
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,005
- (SIGHS) Okay, is everybody in?
- (EVERYBODY) Yes!

308
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,508
Okay, count off!

309
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,675
(IN UNISON) One...

310
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,944
Goddamn it. Would you go?

311
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,846
But, Veronica, what evidence?

312
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,682
- Well, my darling Alan...
- (VAN STARTING)

313
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:37,351
I have a teensy-tiny
favor to ask of you.

317
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,225
(GILLETTE) My pleasure.

00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,096
Whoa-oa-oa!

(GROANING)

322

Whoa, that kinda hurt. (BONES CRACKING)

323
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,706
Is L.A. making me soft?

324
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,875
Or... softly awesome.

325
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,744

What are we doing?

330
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,565
(IDENTICAL LAUGHING) Are we doing this?

331
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,468
We're hugging it out!

332
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,069
Hey. Are you up for a dangerous mission?

333
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,841
Am I? There is literally no
question I ever wanted to hear...

334
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,976
- more than that!
- Okay, cool.

337
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,154
my previous statement.

338
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,753
Okay, come on. I'll brief
you while we get ready.

Me and you... is this not the best?

- Excuse me.

Do you have any idea how
long this is going to take?

Yes.

Or forever, once Veronica Deane fakes
her whatever bullshit evidence on me.

351
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:22,870
Thanks to you and Archer, who
lied to the cops with her.

352
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,373
- Hope you're happy!
- Uh, duh... Free cornrows.

- Lana, Sterling feels awful about that.
- Phht!

Which is why he's out there right now,

355

working on a plan to trap Veronica Deane

356
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,782
so there's no need to worry.

357
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,817
ARCHER: Are you sure?

358
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes! Trust me, it's a good plan.

359
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:42,056
It just kind of seems a little more
complicated than it needs to be.

360
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,393
No, it isn't. Shut up. It'll work.

361
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,295
Hmm. Also, why are we wearing tuxedos?

362
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,131
Exactly. Okay. Let's do this! (SNICKERS)

363

Oh, man. We're just like
the Wonder Twins, right?

364
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,904
I would take the form of, uh, an eagle.
What about you?

365
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:59,648
I guess... I don't know. Ice stairs?

Eh, Luigi! Piccolo aiuto, eh?

(CHUCKLES) I be... I beg your pardon?

370
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:11,450
Your margarita. Salt around the rim?

371
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:14,220
Oh. Sorry. Yes. More than you know.

372
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,022
Although, I have to say...

373
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:19,026
I prefer my margaritas
on the beach in Mexico.

374
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,030
Mm, yes, of course! And we'll dance
naked on the beach in Mexico...

375
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,364
after... Oh, my!

376
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:29,368
Is that a gun in your pocket,
or are you just glad to see me?

377
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,738
Oh! Uh, both. Sorry.

378
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:35,241
I'll just lay this right
here, on this table.

379
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,078
You were saying... Mexico? After...

380
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,480
Well, after they formally charge
Lana Kane with Ellis's murder.

381
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:43,917
- And... you think they will.
- Oh, I should think so.

382
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,553
Once they find her enormous
fingerprints on the gun.

383
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:51,091
- And you think they will?
- I... Archer, do you love me?

384
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,993
Oh, darling. Don't you know I do?

385
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,830
Well, then... in that case,

386
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:59,166
let's just say I have my ways.

Oh, it's not Alan's fault, darling.

He's doing it because he loves me.

00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,079
Making men fall in love with you?

393

Well, that's not a crime. Is it?

394
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:19,018
No. But murder is. And I know
you murdered Ellis Crane,

with all the details,

and science, which actually I
don't even understand, so...

411
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,002
So, all this time, you
knew that I killed Ellis.

412
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:12,072
Well, I suspected. All that
"stroke of three" stuff?

413
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:15,674
Then you were trying so hard
to make Lana look guilty?

over here, just because

I was mad at her... I mean, Jesus!

- I'm such an idiot.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that, darling.

00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,419
You caught me, didn't you?

418
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,755
- Well, yeah, but...
- You knew that I was secretly having

all these shoots sabotaged,

420
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,192
because Sandpiper-Crane was
insuring the productions

421

for ten times what they could
ever make at the box office!

- Yes.
- Well, bravo, Archer. Bravo.

Well, wait! So Longwater was all
just a grubby little insurance scam?

424
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:49,175
Little? It was a massive insurance scam,

425
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,111
and also a re-insurance scam,

426
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,447
not to mention a stock
manipulation scam...

427

- We made millions!
- (GUFFAWS) I mean, Jesus!

And all this time, I thought
it was just a sex tape!

432
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,628
Oh. That actually was a sex tape,

433

recorded onto a disk

Oh, well, that's just stupid.

00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,469
As are you, Veronica,
you just confessed.

437
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,404
Yes, darling, but only to you.

438
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,474
Doesn't do you a bit of
good without a witness.

- Uh, dahoy?
- What, the robot?

No, not a robot! Again, I don't
understand all the science, but...

because... spoiler alert...

- it's dead!
- Wait, but... Goddamn it!

445
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,994
So, no, Archer. I didn't confess.

446
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:44,564
Not to a crime, anyway. But I'm
afraid I do have to confess

447
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,900
that... ohh...

00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:50,103

Oh! I'll make a note.

you're all free to go.

they have a suspect.

This whole time, I thought Ellis Crane...
was the one behind all this.

468
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:37,383
Yeah, right up until he shot himself
through both the wrist and the face.

469
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,554
Anymahoo, apparently
she shot another guy.

I'm gonna come back as a movie star.

Yeah. Look out, gay porn.

- Yeah, that could be your name.

Yes. Veronica Deane. Don't you remember?

479
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,309
She's a person of interest in
the other murder we're working.

480
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:04,411
- No shit.
- Wait, what are you...

481
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,579
You were just questioning
her ten hours ago!

482
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,681
He was her alibi.

483
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:11,351
- You like her?
- As an actress, or for this homicide?

- Both.
- Loved her in Shanghai Moon.

- Right?

But as for Tennessee Tuxedo
here, I want to talk to her.

487
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:20,360
See if she knows who tried
to weight him down...

488
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:23,596
with an ounce of lead. Found it on
the ground, over there by the table.

- Hard to tell with no serial number.

they put them on there.

492

Hey, you should ask Veronica Deane
if her agent reps gay porn stars.

493
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:32,839
And maybe if she murdered this guy.

- Ah, you got a real knack for this.
- Rim Schott.

Yeah, you don't have
to say it every time.

No, as my gay porn name. Not bad.

already been through all this. So...
