1
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,536
So, uh, what are we doing?

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,568
Are we just jumping
right into this, or...

3
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,251
How are you assholes even here?

4
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:08,634
(Sighs)
We followed you.

5
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:09,548
- Duh.
- Duh.

6
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,251
Hmm!

7
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,813
Looks like she's having
a rough night.

8
00:00:11,876 --> 00:00:14,321
- Her? What about me?
- Will you shut up?

9
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,531
Will you stop
illustrating my point?

10
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,898
So, is this the part where

11
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:19,695
you tell me it's not
what it looks like?

12
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:21,734
- I don't know. What does it look like?
- You tell me.

13
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,195
- It's... not what it looks like?
- Which is...

14
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:28,117
Murder, figgis, you
insufferable little prick!

15
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,311
It looks like murder!

16
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,179
Yeah, I guess it does, kind of.

17
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,406
But it shows what you know,

18
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,820
because it's only accessory
after the fact.

19
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,914
(Scoffs) We were merely
using this poor

20
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,203
pre-deceased young woman
to fake my death.

21
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:40,279
- What?
- Why?

22
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:41,319
She's trying to get out

23
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:43,615
of a quasi-incestuous
home-life situation.

24
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,648
How quasi?

25
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,609
(Sighs)
Like, a four?

26
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,515
- Meh.
- Put a ham in it, Poovey.

27
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,320
What's your story, lady?
Who are you?

28
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,351
Charlotte Vandertunt?

29
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:55,429
Heiress to the vast
Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?

30
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,797
- Really?
- Schmancy.

31
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,820
Well, then, seeing as how
that's the case,

32
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:01,453
are the keys in the rolls?

33
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:03,195
Yeah. They're...
Wait. Why?

34
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,125
Because I'm going to drive it,

35
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:08,062
and sergeant Poovey is going
to drive you in my car.

36
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,992
To jail. Because you're both
under arrest for murder.

37
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,156
- What?
- Goddamn it.

38
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:14,080
- Poovey?
- Huh? Oh.

39
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,492
Now we'll see how you like

40
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,804
getting your tits
screwed off for a change.

41
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,750
(Snickering)
Wh... what?

42
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,500
Remember? 'Cause you screwed
his wife's tits off.

43
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,070
- Damn it, Poovey!
- What? Figuratively!

44
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:27,312
Well, either way, I can
tell you right now i...

45
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:29,656
Wait. Did you say
"a change" or just "change,"

46
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:30,804
as in spare change?

47
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:31,992
Huh! What change?

48
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,304
They'll be passing you around
for half a pack of smokes.

49
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,820
Pff! I'm worth
at least two packs.

50
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,008
Pff!
You know.

51
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:41,289
And, Poovey,
book her as a Jane Doe.

52

53

Poovey:
No. I told you, you can't.

Little Miss Vanderpanties

Are you booking Charlotte
as a Jane Doe?

65

He's gonna keep her
locked up here,

66
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,016
call her parents
posing as a kidnapper,

and use the ransom money to
square things with Len Trexler

for losing his
Chinese sex slaves!

Oh. Thought you meant
besides that.

70

The Chinese sex slaves,
by the way, that you let goooo!

Aw, I wouldn't shit you.
You're my favorite turd.

00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,374
But what are you gonna do

I mean, obviously,
we'll put it to a vote, but...

I could actually go
for some pie.

Hey, uh, could I order some pie?

93
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,478
Or have you singlehandedly

94
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:49,319
depleted the global

So what are you in here for?

106
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,247
Well, murder, but technically,

107
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,778
it was just gross abuse
of a corpse.

run our prints

and figure out
we gave 'em fake names.

name not the best?

129

You're lucky
I don't have a pistol.

130
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:11,567
Or even a belt.
Or even shoelaces.

get you guys outta here,

to do it, though.

135

Escape, obviously.

need you to forgive me.

00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,322
Remind me never
to rent you a mule.

158
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,299
Why would I want to rent a mule?

159
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,835
- Maybe you're afraid of commitment.
- So, listen.

160
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,960
What do you think about our
chances of getting out of here?

161
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:13,743
Hmm. I don't know.

162
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:16,165
Four?
Out of... five?

163
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,696
(Grunts)
Why not?

164
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,868
Mother: I'm sorry.
I must have misheard you.

165
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,454
Because it sounded like you said

166
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,314
you're not doing
your second set.

167
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:29,630
I don't have a Band.

168
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,423
They never came back
from their Smoke Break.

169
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:35,259
Bet they got arrested again.
Idiots.

170
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,699
What is it with you people
and reefer?

171
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,993
- Do you mean musicians or negroes?
- Pick one.

172
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,109
No, because I'm
going home now, so...

173
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,571
You most certainly are not.

174
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:46,595
Get up there and
entertain those people.

175
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,962
How? Do you want me
to do a striptease?

176
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,860
- Hmm.
- That was a joke.

177
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,525
- Well, clearly.
- Wha...?

178
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:55,314
But I wonder. What if
we had a comedy night?

179
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,228
Comedians, little routines...

180
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,556
And where the hell
is the bartender?

181
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:03,430
Woman:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

182
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,665
Excuse me! Doctor, where are
you taking this patient?

183
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,743
Yeah, what do we got
going on here?

184
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,689
Tests.
Just some routine tests.

185
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,032
Okay, let's get you
dancin', handsome.

186
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,774
I am handsome.

187
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,914
Maybe I could do
a comedy routine.

188
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,611
I mean, how hard could that be?

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,382
- Cliff: Seriously?
- Archer: What?

190
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:22,095
You look like a Rodeo Clown.

191
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,550
(Chuckles) You've clearly
never been to a Rodeo.

192
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,279
Aw, brother, I have.

193
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:28,173
That was the circus.

194
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,806
No. There were lions.

195
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:32,540
Look, man, verl's
got to be the cop.

196
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,056
I mean, you know,
no offense, but...

197
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,142
The fact that you feel like
you have to say "no offense"...

198
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,590
- Moot!
- Wait. What?

199
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,598
- What?
- Moot. It's my plan.

200
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,407
- I'm the Cop.
- (Scoffs) Come on.

201
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,689
You look like you should
be policing a cornfield.

202
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,267
Arresting crows and shit.

203
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:47,126
Caw! Caw!
Seriously.

204
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,584
No. I'm the Cop.

205
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:50,861
For one thing, I have
military experience, so...

206
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:53,283
Me and Verl were in the Army.
And I was in the Navy.

207
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,532
Well, but, you know,
I didn't segregate the service,

208
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,913
and no offense, but...
But here it comes.

209
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,064
Well, but what did
you do, exactly?

210
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:02,572
I was in the transport corps.
I was a steward.

211
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,939
- Exactly. So, you know...
- Oh, I get it.

212
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,197
So, no matter how eager

213
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,517
Negroes were to prove
ourselves in combat,

214
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,306
thanks to segregation,
most of us

215
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,853
had to serve in support units.

216
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,892
And driving trucks
and serving coffee

217
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,605
don't exactly make us
war heroes.

218
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,056
No. Come on. Look, I realize

219
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,259
that a segregated service
is just crazy.

220
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,743
Especially when you think about

221
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,579
what we were fighting
for over there, but...

222
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,165
Oh, so now you got a "but."
But if you think about it,

223
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,337
the most racist thing would be
if whenever there was a war,

224
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,876
we<i> only</i> sent Negroes.

225
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:35,583
- Wow!
- Words fail me.

226
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,407
- I failed my induction screening.
- Well, obviously.

227
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,907
You put the "F" in "4-F."
You know...

228
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:44,923
Okay, verl can be the cop.
But I'm still squad leader.

229
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:48,069
And I need you guys
to respect that.

230
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,702
Come on. Come on.
Move your lazy asses.

231
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,972
- Oh, that's good. That's good, Verl.
- Very believable.

232
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,140
Will you quit jamming
my ass with that thing?

233
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,335
He said, coyly.
Silence, prisoner.

234
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,631
(Men chuckling)
Yeah. Shut up.

235
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:01,179
And the next cop we see,
I'm getting his uniform.

236
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,687
So...
(Door opens)

237
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:05,511
Damn it.

238
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,722
- Complete and total bullshit.
- Dress that line, boy!

239
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:11,288
(Men chuckling) Talk about looking
like a scarecrow.

240
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:14,108
- Caw! Caw!
- Doesn't even work there, so...

241
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,187
So, hey, I'm not an Architect,
but I'm pretty sure

242
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,757
you can't leave a building
through the sub-basement.

243
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:23,530
So, unless they keep all the
fingerprint cards down here...

244
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,275
In the dampest part
of the building...

245
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,069
What the hell
are we doing down here?

246
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,796
Well, um, it's a surprise.

247
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,608
Oh, goody!
Let me guess.

248
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:36,171
Is it, uh, a truck full
of my Chinese whores?

249
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,437
Uh, better.

250
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,560
Oh!

251
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,782
A slightly larger truck
full of my Chinese whores?

252
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,843
- Even better.
- I feel like we're gonna run out

253
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,551
of things to fill
with Chinese whores.

254
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,335
No. You'll forget
all about them

255
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,499
when you hear what
I've got for you.

256
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,343
Intriguing.
(Chuckles)

257
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,866
All right.
Give me a hint.

258
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,801
Two words:
Charlotte Vandertunt.

259
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,402
(Gasps)
The heiress to the Vast
Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?

260
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,601
And, by inference, an ideal
target for kidnapping.

261
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,468
I'm not kidnapping a Vandertunt.

262
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,608
You don't have to.
I already did.

263
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:07,007
Are you serious?

264
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,882
Oh,Figgis, that is
some good work.

265
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:13,051
- Where is she?
- Downtown, booked in as a Jane Doe.

266
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,202
You got her in that shitty jail?

267
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,767
No! You go get her,
and you bring her here.

268
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:20,062
- But...
- "But" nothing, ya little weasel.

269
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,452
Bring her to me.
I wanna to meet her.

270
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,210
Oh, I bet she's charming.

271
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:28,257
(Screaming)

272
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,515
(Screaming continues)
What... what is happening
right now?

273
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:36,202
That's what I'm trying to...
What the hell is wrong with you?

274
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,663
Everything!

275
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,200
I spent my life in jail, and now
I'm a disgusting old woman!

276
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,061
(Overlapping chatter)
What is she talking about?

277
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,921
Oh! My God, the future
is terrifying!

278
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,209
How many years
have I been in here?

279
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:52,694
Wha... (Chuckles) It's been,
like, a half an hour.

280
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,030
What? No, but...
(Breathing heavily)

281
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,054
But then... how...

282
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,161
(whispering)
How are there negro policemen?

283
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,280
Uh, definitely Negro policemen.
(Overlapping chatter)

284
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,328
I... but...
I mean, since when?

285
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,282
In L.A.?
I wanna say...

286
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,974
Was it 1886?

287
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,127
Yep. Patrolman
Robert w. Stewart.

288
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,788
Big beat-walkin' Bob.

289
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,510
- They called him that?
- How should I know?

290
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,288
(Sighs)
Uh...

291
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,249
(Chuckles) Well, then,
I don't know what to say.

292
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,413
I am simply mortified.

293
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,890
Please accept
my apology. I...

294
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,366
(Chuckles)
You're my first Negroes.

295
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:29,462
So, was this a surprise?

296
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,858
Because I already know
a crazy lady. His aunt Marva.

297
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:35,204
- Eats paper. By the pound.
- Mm-hmm. God bless that mess.

298
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,371
So, no. The surprise is,
we're gonna seriously jeopardize

299
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,041
our own chance of escaping
by taking her with us.

300
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:43,062
(Discontented
overlapping chatter)

301
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:46,022
Poovey:
I say we put it to a vote.
(Sighs)

302
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,288
I vote no.

303
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:49,116
Poovey, come on.
Don't do this.

304
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,952
Make me.
I mean, don't make me.

305
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,991
Look, I know you Cops have to
check your weapons up front,

306
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,882
and there's five of us
and only one of you, so...

307
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:00,241
So who wants
their ass beat first?
(Bones crack)

308
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:01,779
And before you decide,

309
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,589
keep in mind I'm gradually
gonna get more tired,

310
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,726
but also gradually
more berserker.

311
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,009
(Shrieks in delight)

312
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,899
This is the best...
Day... ever!

313
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,273
(Shrieks)

314
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:16,197
Being a negro
must be so exciting.

315
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,154
(Applause)
Lana: Thank you.

316
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:25,037
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you're too kind.

317
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,826
How's everybody doing tonight?

318
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,347
Doing good?
Having a swell time?

319
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,654
(Snorts)
Yeah? Everybody having fun?

320
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:35,451
Painting the town Red?
Wonderful!

321
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,513
Terrific.

322
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:39,857
So, I'm gonna want a rematch.

323
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:41,743
(Breathily)
Me too.

324
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:45,435
What in the hell is she doing?

325
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,069
I'll tell you
who's not having fun.

326
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:51,008
Al Capone. He just died.
You hear about this?

327
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:53,031
Yep. He died of Syphilis.

328
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,473
Wouldn't wanna be that broad,
would ya? (Laughs)

329
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,286
(In ditzy voice,
Brooklyn accent):
Hi, alphonse?

330
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:00,801
Yeah, it's me, trixie.

331
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,036
Yeah, so, i was just callin'

332
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:06,739
to say thanks
for a such a lovely evenin'.

333
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,606
Yeah, me too.

334
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,658
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

335
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,114
Yeah, so listen, um...

336
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:16,239
Tsk.
(Sighs)

337
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:20,075
(Audience member coughs)
(In normal voice):
You know, like she's calling

338
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,876
notorious criminal Al Capone to
tell him she gave him Syphilis.

339
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,731
That's... that's
pretty awkward, right?

340
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,997
Although she was probably
a prostitute.

341
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,043
And why you'd give your phone
number to a prostitute...

342
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:33,543
So... so what else?

343
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,020
(Poovey coughing)

344
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,536
You know how pissed off
Figgis is gonna be

345
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,528
when he finds out you walked off
with his million-dollar payday?

346
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,481
Roughly the same
as if he finds out

347
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,928
about your new Chinese
sister-wives?

348
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,551
(Gong bangs)
(Women exclaiming)

349
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,309
Oh, goody.

350
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,356
(Exclaiming continues)
Another sweater.

351
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,645
(Sighs)
All right, Archer.
You win this round.

352
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:57,801
Yeah. I mean, you're handcuffed
to a pipe, so obviously.

353
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:02,098
- Hey, let's go.
- We'll go when your squad leader says we'll go.

354
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,418
Which is now.
Let's go.

355
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,241
Hang on. We still gotta get
our fingerprint cards.

356
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,270
Oh, right.
Where do they keep them?

357
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,579
Second floor, room 202.

358
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:14,239
But good luck getting in there without a...
(Alarm blaring)

359
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,153
(Braying laughter)

360
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,012
A distraction. Nice!

361
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,168
Poovey:
I was gonna say...
ooh! Sprinklers! Nice!

362
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,969
The key, you dickheads!

363
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:26,864
Ohh, right. Duh.

364
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,637
Whew. What else?

365
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,645
Uh... oh, prostitutes
and, uh, Syphilis. Okay.

366
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,248
So, I heard about a male
prostitute who got Syphilis.

367
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,641
Yeah. Apparently,
he was fine for a while,

368
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:40,326
but then business
kind of dropped off.

369
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,646
Reminds me... uh, reminds me
of my cousin Eddie.

370
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,596
Uh, he goes to see the family
doctor. Doctor says,

371
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,369
(in masculine voice): "Well, I've got
some good news and bad news.

372
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,166
The bad news is,
your wife has Syphilis."

373
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:57,224
"My God," Eddie says,
"what's the good news?" Doctor says,

374
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,571
(in masculine voice)
"Good news is,
she didn't get it from you...

375
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,196
(Laughs)
"Based on this

376
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:06,074
medical examination."
(Faint coughing)

377
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,034
All right. Let's... let's see
what else I got here.

378
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,977
Uh, Syphilis, Syphilis,

379
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,641
Syphilis, Syphilis, Syphilis,
Syphilis, Syphilis...

380
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:15,383
Oh, hey! How 'bout
that taft-hartley act?

381
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:17,201
Man:
Show us your tits!

382
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,792
I mean...

383
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,078
Oh, jeez, I'm getting wet!
(Clamoring)

384
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:23,453
Archer: Will you hurry up?

385
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,313
Hang on. I got everybody's
but mine. Uh...

386
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,939
(Cackling)

387
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,157
Here it is!
Oh, my God.

388
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:33,735
Oh, it's hilari...

389
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,673
(laughing)

390
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,736
"Phil Mccracken."

391
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,635
(Laughing continues)

392
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,090
(Siren wailing)
Right?

393
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:46,137
What the hell is going on here?

394
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:49,614
Uh, do what now?
I said, what the hell's going on here?

395
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,786
(Clears throat)
It's a... a prisoner... prisoner transport.

396
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,965
Uh, taking these reefer addicts
over to Newton street...

397
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,950
- Oh, well...
- For treatment and counseling.

398
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,179
Nope.
For what?

399
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,849
- Damn it, Floyd.
- Floyd? Wh...

400
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,602
Why did he...
Wait a minute.

401
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,332
- What's your badge and unit number?
- F-Four?

402
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,918
What?
(Grunts)

403
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,223
(Goofy laughter)

404
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:11,012
Okay, you are just terrifying.

405
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:14,364
Shut it, Mccracken.
And "treatment and counseling"?

406
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,123
- Seriously?
- Floyd: What?

407
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:18,322
I bet in the long run
it's more economical.

408
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,594
Just get in the truck.
(Engine starts)

409
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:21,923
Yeah, I'm getting in the truck

410
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,597
because I choose to get
into the truck.

411
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,464
- I...
- Wait! Take me with you.

412
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,165
- We are.
- Oh.

413
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,668
Well, then, I shall thank you
to mind your tone.

414
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,671
(Alarm continues blaring)
What?

415
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,072
(Shouting)
I said...

416
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:35,443
(alarm stops) (Normal voice):
Oh.

417
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,671
- I said, "Archer got away."
- Oh, that son of a...

418
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,446
As did the Vandertunt Broad.

419
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:41,015
What? How could you
let that happen?

420
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,514
There were five of 'em!

421
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,585
And I had to check my gun,
obviously, so I...

422
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,584
See you didn't check yours.

423
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,355
No. No, there was
so much confusion.

424
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,523
Yeah, right?

425
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,124
Right. For instance,
I'm confused

426
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,895
about why I don't just go ahead

427
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:56,964
and shoot you in
your stupid fat face.

428
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,832
Well, for one thing...
(Gasps) Noooo!

429
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,633
(Ringing in ears) (Muted) Okay, you dummy.
So tonight, right now,

430
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,206
you're gonna find
the Vandertunt Broad,

431
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:06,604
and you're gonna find Archer.

432
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,105
You're gonna bring her
to Trexler's,

433
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,941
and you're gonna
leave him in some alley

434
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,772
(gibberish) With a case of lead poisoning,
just like his partner.

435
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,777
(Normal volume): You got it?
Mawp. Mawp.

436
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,809
That better have been
a long-ass apology.

437
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,184
Mother:
I'm sorry, what was that?

438
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:21,152
No, just, if I had more time,

439
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,723
I... I could really
tighten up my set.

440
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:24,452
Oh, I don't know
how you'd improve

441
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,627
on a solid half-hour
about Syphilis.

442
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,559
- Wait. What?
- Ew!

443
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,360
What I do know
is all the refunds I gave

444
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,163
are coming out of your paycheck.

445
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,232
- But...
- You've got a "But"?

446
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,863
- I'll say.
- Zip it, Missy.

447
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,968
And, come to think of it,
the refunds will come

448
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,630
out of all your paychecks!

449
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,339
- Damn it, Ray!
- That's some bullshit.

450
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,700
And I swear to God,
if you people get caught

451
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,439
- smoking reefers again...
- I'm sorry. By "you people," do you mean...

452
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,014
Out! All of you, out!

453
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,915
Not so fast, shamus.

454
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:53,985
(Sighs) Damn it.

455
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,886
Hey, not that it should matter,
but I was a Tanker.

456
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,719
761st Tank Battalion.

457
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,492
Wait. Patton's Panthers?

458
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,693
You guys saved
our asses at the bulge.

459
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:05,535
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, now I feel like an asshole.

460
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:08,231
Well, can't help you with that.

461
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,874
Mother: Archer! And that little
chippie of yours.

462
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,030
(Laughs) I beg your pardon?

463
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,268
- Keep it up, and you will.
- Wait. What?

464
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,074
I'm not accustomed
to being stood up,

465
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,814
Mr. Archer,
and yet once again...

466
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,241
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just...

467
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,185
Well, she isn't
just some chippie.

468
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,552
She's actually
Charlotte Vandertunt.

469
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:28,051
I... you mean, the heiress

470
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:31,053
to the vast Vandertunt
Publishing Fortune?

471
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,456
- Uh, duh.
- Zerp.

472
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,258
Then do tell.
What's a nice heiress like you

473
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,791
- doing in a joint like this?
- I rescued her.

474
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:41,067
Len Trexler and that Cop Figgis
were gonna kidnap her, so...

475
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,234
How were they going to do that?

476
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,235
Well, nobody knows
where she is, so...

477
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,877
I'm trying to escape a
quasi-incestuous

478
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,103
family situation.

479
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,268
- How?
- A four.

480
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,910
Eh.
Yeah, so...

481
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,611
So, presumably,
the Vandertunt family

482
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,513
still doesn't know where she is?

483
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,955
I mean, don't know
how they would.

484
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,651
Excellent.

485
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:05,490
(Gasps) - Oh, shit.
- What?

486
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,791
Mother: Well, then, I suggest
you wake him.

487
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,393
Unless you think Mr. Vandertunt

488
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,765
would rather see
his daughter gradually...

489
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,064
Via the mail.

490
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:16,666
(Joyous squealing)
(Tapping floor)

491
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,269
(High-pitched laugh)

492
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,900
Best... day... ever!

493
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,640
(Growls)

494
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:23,901
Right?

495
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,614
