1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:02,585
Yam! Yom! Yom!

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,586
Stop. Stop it.

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,587
Yah! Huh! Yum! Yum! Yum!

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:05,588
Pam!

5
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,589
Yum-yum-yum!

6
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,057
Yum-yum-yum! Gimme! Gimme!

7
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:09,692
Yum-yum! Gimme!

8
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,193
Goddamn it, will you

9
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,395
calm the shit down?!

10
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:13,396
Wow.

11
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:14,397
Well?!

12
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:15,398
This isn't good practice.

13
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,432
My baby's not gonna be

14
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,733
a coke addict!

15
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:18,534
Wow.

16
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:19,535
Oh, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:21,037
What would you like to call it?

18
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,705
Mm, cocaine enthusiast?

19
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,273
Is it too late

20
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,775
to not have it?

21
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,276
Yes! For the jillionth

22
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,412
time, I want this baby, so...

23
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,446
Well, sure, <i>now.</i>

24
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,281
Wait until you're waist-deep in

25
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,450
dirty diapers, or he's up with

26
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,718
the croup and there's no bourbon

27
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,053
in the house.

28
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,089
Ugh!

29
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:41,257
Then fast-forward to him

30
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,625
knocking up the au pair,

31
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:43,893
flunking out of college, and

32
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,095
then singlehandedly bankrupting

33
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,264
your drug cartel!

34
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,465
Wait... college?

35
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,399
Yeah, right?

36
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,734
My point is...

37
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:52,735
All babies should

38
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:53,602
be drowned?

39
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:55,905
Not <i>all</i> babies.

40
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,606
Just baby people.

41
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:58,908
Don't you have a...

42
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,076
tractor pull to headline?

43
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:00,943
Yes.

44
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:01,577
No!

45
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,244
Aw...

46
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:03,312
No more of that

47
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,113
bush-league nonsense.

48
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:05,414
We're getting Cherlene

49
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,917
a record deal.

50
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,785
Sterling can't screw that up.

51
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,120
Look, I think maybe

52
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,088
Archer's just been trying

53
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,922
too hard.

54
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:13,756
Ha!

55
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:14,957
I'm serious. I mean,

56
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,659
as sad as it is, deep down, he

57
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,827
just wants your approval, and

58
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,128
lately you've been putting so

59
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,429
much pressure on him.

60
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,464
Well?

61
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,599
How hard is it to sell 2,000

62
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,768
measly pounds of cocaine?!

63
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,470
Or whatever we're down to now,

64
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:30,306
1,900 and... What?!

65
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:32,608
Pam! You damn coke fiend!

66
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,609
Ow! Ow! Ow!

67
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,979
Malory, stop!

68
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,280
I mean, did you used

69
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,281
to be a man?

70
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:40,282
Pam?

71
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:41,283
I don't know. Did you?

72
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,284
Have you been

73
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,285
stealing coke?

74
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,286
Wha...? No!

75
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,688
You think, if I had 100 pounds

76
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,689
of coke, I'd be sitting here

77
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,690
playing choo-choo-spoon with

78
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,691
a tranny?

79
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:49,692
Oh, for the...!

80
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,494
I'm pregnant!

81
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,628
It said, baffling

82
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,529
medical science.

83
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,363
Ow!

84
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,198
Enough! But, Pam,

85
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,334
I swear to God, if I find out

86
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,835
you're lying to me...

87
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,203
I'm not! About this!

88
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,471
Well, then where the

89
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,672
hell did it go?!

90
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,641
Oh, you were serious?

91
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:06,675
Yes!

92
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,643
No! Stop!

93
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:08,644
Gimme!

94
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:09,512
Archer, move your...

95
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,146
Ray!

96
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:10,980
Stop it!

97
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:12,048
Let me do it!

98
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,349
Come on! Just for a minute!

99
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,183
No!

100
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,017
Goddamn it!

101
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:15,985
What could go wrong?!

102
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:16,886
Uh, you could

103
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:17,686
crash it!

104
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:18,554
Just like you crashed

105
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,355
the damn space shuttle!

106
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,489
>> ARCHER Oh, my

107
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,824
God, right?

108
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,692
Remember that?

109
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:24,894
Ray, you remember?

110
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,065
You got paralyzed?

111
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,134
How do you not remember that?

112
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,542
Oh, my God, Cyril,

113
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,877
for the... We're not just

114
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,078
waltzing into Colombia with

115
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,546
100 pounds of cocaine.

116
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:18,547
We're sneaking in

117
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,548
under the radar.

118
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,549
Literally and

119
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:21,550
figuratively.

120
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:22,551
I...

121
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:23,552
Is there a name

122
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:24,753
for that when it's both?

123
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,388
Like in French or something?

124
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,289
I meant

125
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,390
once we get there!

126
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:29,592
Your plan is to just ask

127
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:30,759
around for...?

128
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,927
La Madrina, yes,

129
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:32,928
the Godmother.

130
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,929
I know what it means.

131
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,064
I hate I took Latin.

132
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,065
Maybe someday you'll

133
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,066
meet a mummy.

134
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,300
But what do you think

135
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,401
is gonna happen when three

136
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,436
gringos waltz in and start

137
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,570
asking around for the woman

138
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,439
who runs the entire Cali cartel?

139
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,440
Well, again, Cyril,

140
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:45,441
we won't actually be waltz...

141
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:46,442
You know what I mean!

142
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,443
I also know what

143
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,444
I'm doing!

144
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,445
Yeah, showing mommy

145
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:50,446
who's a big boy.

146
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:51,447
What?!

147
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,449
Oh, you want to see who's

148
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:54,450
a big boy?

149
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,653
Archer!

150
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,255
Take it back!

151
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,924
Cyril, help!

152
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,592
Uh, uh...

153
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:04,927
Oh.

154
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,729
Ow!

155
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,797
Ow!

156
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,099
I don't know where Archer is!

157
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,600
Then find him,

158
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:12,968
you bearded buffoon!

159
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,436
Use the... the surveillance

160
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:15,437
satellite.

161
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,438
Oh, you were

162
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,439
serious?

163
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,440
Wha...?!

164
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,608
Don't ask her that.

165
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,776
She hates it.

166
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,111
ISIS had satellites.

167
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,612
The whatever we are, Gang Who

168
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:24,613
Couldn't Sell Coke Straight,

169
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:25,614
doesn't even have cable.

170
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:26,615
But what about

171
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:27,616
all these?

172
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:28,617
They're all aimed

173
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:29,618
inside the house.

174
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,619
Well, what the hell

175
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:31,620
good is that for?!

176
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:32,621
Eh, I'm making

177
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,622
about two grand a month

178
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:34,623
on the Gilfcam.

179
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,624
Ew!

180
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,792
The what cam?

181
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,027
"What is your..."

182
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,298
Hmm.

183
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,701
Dear Gilf Hound 69...

184
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,136
Jesus Christ.

185
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:48,504
Thanks for the concussion,

186
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:49,505
dicks.

187
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,539
>> CYRIL and RAY: Well?

188
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,807
Oh, and just so

189
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,975
you know, that's exactly how

190
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:54,210
Len Koenecke died.

191
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,344
Who?

192
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,513
"Who." Typical.

193
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,524
Goddamn it, will you

194
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:09,725
slow the shit down?!

195
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:12,828
I'm sorry, was there

196
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,829
a question?

197
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,031
Because nobody made

198
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,333
you two come here.

199
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:18,734
I didn't put a gun

200
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,703
to your heads.

201
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:21,670
I mean, not literally

202
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,405
to your heads.

203
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,742
So, if you'll hide your vaginas,

204
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,510
it's time to gather some intel.

205
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:29,345
Intel?

206
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,013
No, do not compare what we

207
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:32,681
do now to intelligence work.

208
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,049
Don't worry, I won't!

209
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,351
Because selling cocaine to

210
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,386
cocaine dealers doesn't really

211
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,021
compare to helping overthrow

212
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:40,356
democratically elected

213
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,090
governments!

214
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,359
Like the U.S. did in Guatemala,

215
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,761
Chile, Nicaragua, uh...

216
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,029
Oh! Iran?!

217
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,430
Because... spoiler alert... those

218
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,865
didn't really work out so great!

219
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,033
But that's okay, because I'm

220
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,401
pinning my hopes for the

221
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,769
future on the next big shipment

222
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,204
of Stinger missiles to that

223
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,439
ragtag bunch of Mujahideen

224
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,041
heroes in Afghanistan!

225
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,377
I... Wow, it seems

226
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,945
like you've actually given this

227
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:03,946
some thought.

228
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,214
Plus, I mean, it's not

229
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,115
like we're selling cocaine

230
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,082
to little kids.

231
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,617
And ISIS did do a lot

232
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,551
of bad stuff.

233
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:10,719
We blew up an

234
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:11,587
oil pipeline.

235
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,055
Not to mention a bunch

236
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:14,390
of people, which, compared to

237
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,591
that, this is kind of a

238
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:16,792
victimless crime.

239
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,460
If it even is a crime.

240
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,728
I mean, is it?

241
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,130
He said, sucking at

242
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,131
being a lawyer.

243
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,465
I'm actually an

244
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,433
excellent lawyer.

245
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:25,601
And I'm excellent in

246
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:26,935
the field, so...

247
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,070
Maybe at ISIS.

248
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,271
But on ISIS missions, you had

249
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,572
big dossiers with all the

250
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:31,774
information you could

251
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,309
possibly need.

252
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,143
Yeah, but I never

253
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,944
read them.

254
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,781
What's up, <i>pendejos?</i>

255
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,284
<i>Ay, mierda.</i>

256
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,586
Oh, goddamn Latin.

257
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:47,890
I just feel like such a tourist.

258
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,762
Colombia?

259
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:54,930
What are they doing in Colombia?

260
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,098
I...

261
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,299
And how did you know

262
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,334
where they were?

263
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,335
I thought you couldn't

264
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,469
track them.

265
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,470
Ray posted a

266
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:02,471
Snacklesnap.

267
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:03,672
It's where you take artsy photos

268
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,274
of your food and share it with

269
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,342
people.

270
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,609
Snacklesnamps is

271
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,610
awesome.

272
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:09,812
Look, here's some cocaine

273
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:10,979
puddin; here's some more

274
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:11,980
cocaine puddin.

275
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,115
Ooh, cocaine puddin.

276
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,116
Why would anyone want

277
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,484
a picture of someone else's

278
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,819
food?

279
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,853
Well, no, they

280
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:18,854
don't.

281
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,855
Yeah, everybody hates

282
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:20,856
it.

283
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,857
Mmm,

Snacklesnaaamps...!

285
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,959
But why take cocaine

286
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,160
<i>to</i> Colombia?

287
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,296
I assume as a sample?

288
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,530
To show some cartel boss that

289
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,965
our product is high-quality and

290
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,667
already in the States?

291
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:32,668
Saving them the

292
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,802
transport cost.

293
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,471
But those three waltzing around

294
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,005
Colombia with millions of

295
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,173
dollars of cocaine?!

296
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,375
My God, they could already be

297
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:40,642
dead!

298
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:41,810
Oh, Malory, come on.

299
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:42,978
This is Archer, okay?

300
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,146
He can take care of himself.

301
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:45,147
Yeah, and I doubt

302
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,315
they were actually waltzing.

303
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:47,349
I'm sure they're

304
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,885
totally fine.

305
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,321

Here's to you, Hal Needham.

00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:06,168
Man, why bother with coke?

309
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,569
I just made 100,000 pesos for

lucrative business proposition.

00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,063
Do you know her or...

No, but I can

But...

413
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,671
Look, I realize this

414
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:56,738
is somewhat my fault, Cyril.

415
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,241
We can talk about it later.

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,183

00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:22,230
Cyril, did you get it?

420
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,231
Yes!

421
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,266
Then come on!

422
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:29,705
Hit it!

00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,707
Cyril!

424
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,708
I'm coming as fast as

425
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,775
I can!

426
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,876
Guys, we really need

427
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,078
to talk about getting "phrasing"

back in the rotation.

429
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,950
Woooohoohoohoooo!

430
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,019
Hammer down!

431
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,224
Oh, I'm sorry, Ray.

432
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,626
By "hammer," I meant

433
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:51,627
"accelerator."

434
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:52,961
It's floored, and it's

435
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,062
overheating.

436
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,097
Well, then stop, you

437
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,098
idiot.

438
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,399
I am not the idiot who

439
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,400
packed the engine compartment

440
00:11:58,402 --> 00:11:59,901
full of cocaine.

441
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:01,136
Oh, right.

442
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,404
Uh, we should get that out.

443
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:03,405
Good idea, that will

444
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:04,473
give us something to do while we

445
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,774
sit here and wait for those guys

446
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,075
to drive up and murder us.

447
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,243
Ray, they're not

448
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,411
driving anywhere without a

449
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,579
distributor cap, so...

450
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,449
Cyril, may I see the

451
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,084
distributor cap?

452
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:19,588
Whew, man, Cyril, you had me

453
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,589
worried.

454
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:21,657
I-I did?

455
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,091
Yeah, see, I always

456
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,127
worried I would die without

457
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,495
knowing how it felt to get my

458
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,130
throat slashed and my tongue

459
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,431
yanked out through the gaping

460
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,500
hole.

461
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,671
Are we seriously done with

462
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,938
"phrasing"?

463
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,273
I mean, not right then

464
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:39,675
necessarily, although "tongue"

465
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,143
and "gaping hole" are kind of

466
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,511
begging for it.

467
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:46,615
Gaping hole.

468
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,117
Begging for it.

469
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,086
Eh...

470
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,157
Drop your weapon!

471
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,158

So, I have a question.

514
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,885
Since we're now essentially

515
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,687
captives of the Cali cartel,

516
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,255

00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,857
knows what terrible fate...

518
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,359
Why the hell are you smiling?!

519
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,360
A... we're not their

520
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:06,561
captives; we're about to be

521

their business partners.

522
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,197
B... I bet there's a pretty

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,699

"handsome."

527
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,040
It's your mother.

528
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,041
Wha...?

529
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:21,042
Give me that.

530
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,043
"Putting pressure

531
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,044
on him."

532
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,579
If anything, I've been too lax,

533
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,747
but please, let me benefit from

534
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:26,748
your vast experience as

535
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,749
a mother and...

536
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:28,450
Hey!

537
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,251
Hello, Ray?

538
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,051
Put Sterling on the...

539
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:30,886
Hey, damn it, Archer!

540
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:31,620
Give it h...

541
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,454
Give... Ray, give

542
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,255
it... Ray, give it.

543
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:34,055
I'm serious.

544
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:34,890
I'm serious, Archer,

545
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:35,624
cut it out.

546
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,458
Damn it, give it

547
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,459
here.

548
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:39,427
>> MALORY Sterling?

549
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,763
The mailbox of...

550
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,733
...is full.

551
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,734
Good-bye.

552
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,471
If you're satisfied

553
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,639
with your voice mail greeting,

554
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,773
press one.

555
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,409
How did you...?

556
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,410
You remember that day

557
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:56,411
I took your falafel, and you

558
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:57,412
were chasing me all around the

559
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,413
living room in your wheelchair?

560
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,648
Yes.

561
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,116
Yeah, so I recorded

562
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,317
that, added some sound effects,

563
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,952
mixed it, called my phone and

564
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,253
left it as a message, stole your

565
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:07,155
phone, got into the voice mail

566
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,990
settings, called your phone from

567
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,258
a landline and played the

568
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
message from my phone, then put

569
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,328
your phone back.

570
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,596
Which I think is why it sounds

571
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:15,597
a little compressed, but

572
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,598
whatever.

573
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,599
The...

574
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:18,600
Shut up, we're here.

575
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:19,801
And remember, I got dibs on the

576
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:22,804
tiger.

577
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,973
Well, I have to

578
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,843
admit, Mr. Archer, your proposal

579
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,811
is very... surprising.

580
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:30,812
Not as surprising as

581
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,280
somebody named The Godmother

582
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,982
looking like you.

583
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:36,518
Really.

584
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,119
And what were you expecting?

585
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,354
I guess like a

586
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,122
Mexican Mrs. Garrett?

587
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,324
<i>?Qu?</i>

588
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:43,325
Or Colombian, or

whatever, I...

590
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,328
You talk almost

591
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,329
too much.

592
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,463
But you have aroused my

593
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,198
curiosity.

594
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Just your curiosity?

595
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,470
No.

596
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,173
But first, business, then

597
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,975
pleasure, eh?

598
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,812
Wha...

599
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:04,813
Javier!

as you say...

Oh, my God, we've

607
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:15,824
got something like 900,000

Wait, no, that's

00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,528
grams, so...

612
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,497
So, 900 kilos.

613
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:23,899
I... however many are

A toast, then, to new friends.

619
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,910
Just friends?

620
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:35,911
No.

621
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,716
So, shall we have sex?

622
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,762
Oh, man...

623
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,363
How is it noon?

624
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,198
And where the heck is Archer?

625
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,233
I assume bothering a

626
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,567
tiger.

627
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,070
Oh, God.

628
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,039
Please, <i>no ms.</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, are you sure?

631
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,209
I was sure, like,

632
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,210
three hours ago.

633
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,211
And back then, I could still

634
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,379
feel my legs.

635
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,580
Are you sure you

636
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:13,949
cannot make love to me just once

637
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,550
more?

638
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:16,584
Not without a blood

639
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,786
transfusion, no.

640
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,055
Very well.

641
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:21,056
Ow!

642
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,891
Which is why you don't

643
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:23,892
bother tigers.

644
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:24,893

Then why'd you have

mad, but they are in pretty

668
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:10,605
dangerous territory, and Ray

always answers his phone in

670
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,342
the field, so I'm...

671
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,444
actually worried.

672
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:17,445
Well, if you're so

673
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,480
worried, why don't you go down

674
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:19,647
there and rescue him?

675
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:20,648
I...

676
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,983
Please?

677
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,852
Go find my son and

678
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,855
bring him home to me.

679
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,356
And I didn't even

680
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,792
get to meet her tiger.

681
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:33,161
If she even had a tiger.

682
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:34,996
Plus, at this rate, we're gonna

683
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,131
run out of coke, huh?

684
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,132
Now, there's a moot

685
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:38,133
point.

686
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,134
Since we're being

687

Well, were you sent

do you think we're gonna last

702
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:58,653
in prison?

703
00:18:58,655 --> 00:18:59,654
Hmm.

704
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,490
If we even make it to prison!

705
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,692
Am I right, fellas?

706
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:08,196
Fellas, am I right?

707
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,031
Guys, if we get out of this,

708
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,332
the first thing I'm gonna do,

709
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,333
I swear to God...

710
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,334
If you say "buy a

711
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,903
tiger," we will beat you to

712
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,572
death with your own shoes.
