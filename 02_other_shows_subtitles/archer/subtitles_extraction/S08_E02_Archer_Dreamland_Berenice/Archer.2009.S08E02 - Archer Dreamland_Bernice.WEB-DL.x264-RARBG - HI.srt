<i>FXX presents</i> Archer.

6
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:21,773
So, what are we doing?

7
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:24,139
Are we just jumping
right into this, or...

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,865
- Not literally, you ass!
- Ow! Ow! Will you...

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,091
- You scared me half to death!
- Ow! Damn it!

10
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,483
- You idiot!
- Ow! Stop it!

11
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:32,264
What is your... ow!
(Huffs)

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,103
I would like a drink, please.

13
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,171
Ow. Join this
great new club.

14
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,702
Brandy, if you have it.
Fresh out, turns out.

15
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:40,218
Good lord. You should have

16
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:42,277
your underbutler fire
the housekeeper.

17
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:43,546
Yeah, maybe after he's done

18
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:45,819
getting the caviar stains
out of my spats.

19
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,671
I was being facetious,
Mr. Archer.

20
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,921
- I...
- I know you're poor.

21
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:52,085
- Well, middle class.
- This cannot be the middle.

22
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,350
- Look, Miss...
- Vandertunt.

23
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,741
Heiress to the vast vandertunt
publishing fortune.

24
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:59,718
Right.
So, I've had a long day.

25
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,030
(Gulping)

26
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,194
(Gulping continues)

27
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,132
My partner was murdered.
My office was burgled.

28
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,546
I pissed off two crime bosses
and a dirty cop,

29
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,656
and crushed the ankles
of a psychopath who,

30
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,562
just for kicks, melts people.

31
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,038
So, as much as I would
genuinely like to,

32
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,726
I'm afraid I don't
have time to kill you.

33
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,288
You misunderstand me,
Mr. Archer.

34
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:29,796
I want you to help me
fake my death.

35
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,663
For which I am prepared
to offer you $10,000.

36
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:35,851
Oh.
And my body.

37
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:37,733
The ten grand is plenty.

38
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,764
I'm afraid
this is nonnegotiable.

39
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,983
(Breathily)
Do your worst.

40
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,538
(Chuckles)
I will.

(Singsongy)
I have codeine!

47
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,500
Because heirs to fortunes

48
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,156
like your family's
don't fake their own deaths.

49
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:42,539
They murder their parents

50
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,211
and blame it on some poor
hispanic or negro.

51
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,578
Yes, I thought about that,

52
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,774
but I don't know
any hispanics or negroes.

53
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,617
No, they make up
the hispanic or negro.

54
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,218
I honestly wouldn't know
where to begin.

55
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay, but...
Boy, these are good.

56
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,820
- Mmm! Aren't they?
- Zesty.

57
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,235
But putting aside, for now,

58
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,429
why you'd want to fake
your own death...

59
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:03,406
Because I have to
get away from my family.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,899
They're a seething cauldron
of neurotic, alcoholic,

61
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,719
narcissistic, quasi-incestuous
megalomaniacs!

62
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,707
How quasi?

63
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,875
(Sighs)
I don't know. A four?

64
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,258
Out of what? Are you
going to help me or not?

65
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,180
I... look, I really don't think

66
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,766
you've thought this thing
through.

67
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:22,711
Mm. For starters,
even if you pull this off,

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,060
what are you gonna do for money?

69
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, I...
I shall work, of course.

70
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,331
(Chuckles)
As what?

71
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,086
Uh, one of those.

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,133
A... food-perambulator.

73
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,289
Well, my apologies.
I thought you were

74
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,684
heading into this
half-cocked.

75
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,948
- Said the pot to the kettle.(Giggles)
- My ear hurt!

76
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,422
You're not some runaway kid

77
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,519
whose family couldn't
care less she's gone.

78
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,061
They're gonna
be looking for yourself.

79
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,956
So, to make this work,
you'd need a body.

80
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,120
And not just any body.
A body your same size,

81
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:51,743
same height and weight, your
same general bone structure.

82
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:54,004
A body... I mean,
if you're gonna do

83
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,097
what has to be done here,

84
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:59,135
a body with your exact same
dental records. (Squealing)

85
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,855
- (Laughing giddily)
- Who is that?

86
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,472
I don't know! (Laughs)

87
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,089
- I mean, obviously she's a maid.
- Really.

88
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:09,802
- I just don't know her name, because...
- She's a maid?

89
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,198
Obviously.

90
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,311
Did you kill her?

91
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,319
Wha... no! Jesus!
(Scoffs)

92
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,067
My brother did.
(Exhales)

93
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:21,073
Well, technically, I suppose
the drunken abortionist did.

94
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,433
But my brother got her pregnant
in the first place.

95
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,136
And my father
would've killed her

96
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,417
if she had refused
to get an abortion, so...

97
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,206
- But, I mean, not really?
- Really.

98
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,661
Why do you think
my father started

99
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:32,808
the Spanish-American war?

100
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,073
- Wasn't it sugar?
- He got my aunt pregnant.

101
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,003
- And sugar?
- I guess. I don't know. Shut up!

102
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,769
(Sighs) The point is,
this poor girl was dead

103
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:44,739
- the minute her panties hit the straw.
- The...

104
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,167
- In the stables.
- Ah.

105
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:49,076
- But want to know the best part?
- That wasn't it?

106
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,566
- Look!
- What are you... Uh, no, don't...

107
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,839
Not one cavity, not one filling!

108
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,605
- Since when and how do you know that?
- Don't you see?

109
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,839
Her teeth are perfect.
My teeth are perfect.

110
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,892
Ergo, this plan is perfect!

111
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,103
I mean, dentally, maybe,
but if she just disappears?

112
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,581
Think of her family.
Do you think I haven't?

113
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:07,796
- Yes.
- What?

114
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,459
I think you haven't.

115
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,323
(Sighs)
If you help me do this,

116
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,425
I'll make an anonymous payment
to her family

117
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,066
for an additional $10,000.

118
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,050
Um, how does that
bring them closure?

119
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,781
(Scoffs) It comes with a note
saying she's dead.

120
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,783
Look, nothing we can do
will bring

121
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:23,464
this poor girl back to life.

122
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,229
- I know, but...
- Not even a voodoo priestess,

123
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,269
flown here from Haiti
at great expense,

124
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,284
and then every year,
on grandma's birthday,

125
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,081
- they throw it your face!
- Uh...

126
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,745
So the best thing we can do now

127
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,859
is to fill this car
to the rafters with dynamite

128
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,144
and shove it over a cliff.
(Chuckles)

129
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,683
Ah! That is literally
the worst thing we can do.

130
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:42,553
Oh, right. (Sighs)

131
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:45,046
Dynamite would blow her teeth
all over the stupid beach.

132
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:48,265
- Well, and...
- And then what's the point?

133
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:49,804
(Crunching)

134
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,640
Exactly.

135
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,760
Archer: So we'll fake
the crash tonight,

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,104
but first we're gonna plant
a few seeds.

137
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,841
(Scoffs) First of all,
if I wanted your seed...

138
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,493
Seeds of deception.

139
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,255
Oh, sorry.
I thought you meant...

140
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:08,927
I know what you meant.

141
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,677
What in god's name
are you doing?

142
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,802
- Scrooching down.
- Well, stop it!

143
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,543
- Stop that this instant!
- You stop...

144
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:17,575
Shut up. I don't want anybody
in dreamland to see me.

145
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,036
Well, I don't want
anyone to see me

146
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,098
being chauffeured by a dwarf!

147
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah. Then we'd have to
find a dead dwarf

148
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,607
and a tiny chauffeur uniform.

149
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,950
- Why?
- To... oh, never mind.

150
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,469
But she can't be
dressed like a maid,

151
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,177
so we need to put her
in your clothes.

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,950
(Gasps) Right! Then we should
go to my hotel.

153
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,950
Which is...

154
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,435
- Nice?
- Where...

155
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,716
Oh!
Is your hotel?

156
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:44,282
The chesley, on sunset. That
wasn't so hard, was it?

157
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:47,107
(Snorting chuckle)
That's what I said.

158
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,122
(Guffawing)
(Groans)

159
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,747
(Dutch crying)

160
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,460
Trexler:
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.

161
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,132
Where's my tough guy?

162
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,868
Huh?
Where's my tough old Dutch?

163
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,247
(Sniffles)
There he is.

164
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:01,935
Huh? Now listen.
(Sniffles)

165
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:04,575
Shut up and listen to me, okay?

166
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,325
Because I know...
(Stifled sob)

167
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,825
I know this isn't,
you know, ideal,

168
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,177
but you got to
pull yourself together!

169
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,560
(Sobbing)
No, no. I'm sorry.

170
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,466
That was a poor choice of words,

171
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:16,146
but for Christ's sake, man.

172
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:18,357
There's two dead men
walking around there

173
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,788
who stole from me...
(Crying softly)

174
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:23,669
I.E., my whores, and from you,
I.E., your feet!

175
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:26,052
And you are gonna find them,

176
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:28,638
and you are gonna
bring them to me,

177
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,271
and then I'm gonna
make them wish

178
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,685
they were in hell
with a case of the clap!

179
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,500
How can I?
(Sniffles)

180
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,716
They took my feet, Lenny.

181
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,849
They took my (Sobbing)
Fee-ee-ee-ee-eet!

182
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,388
(Sniffles)
Ow.

183
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,021
- Ow!
- Shut up.

184
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,333
<i>(Dial tone)</i>
Sorry.

185
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,848
I don't pay you to be sorry.

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,615
I pay you to make
other people sorry.

187
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,161
Now here.
<i>(Line ringing)</i>

188
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,919
Do what he tells you.

189
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,520
What who tells me?

190
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,849
The guy that's gonna fix you.

191
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,302
Man:<i> Hello?</i>

192
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,779
(Speaking German)

193
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:06,075
- Archer: What?
- Cheryl: Absolutely not!

194
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,841
- Archer: Why not?
- I'm not gonna stuff

195
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,193
that poor girl into my clothes,
in the trunk of a car,

196
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:12,333
like so much...
Forcemeat!

197
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,865
- So much what?
- Forcemeat. Such as one might find

198
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,259
in a quenelle, roulade,
or galantine.

199
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,646
(Scoffs) Well, now you're
just being obtuse.

200
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:21,877
- I'm being obtuse?
- Yes.

201
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,779
As opposed to you,
who wants to parade

202
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,568
a corpse through a hotel lobby

203
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,638
just so you can dress her
in your room?

204
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,443
Well, I'd hardly
call this a parade.

205
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,403
Man: Oh, good morning,
Miss Vandertunt. (Gasps)

206
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,404
Can I... help you?

207
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,435
No. We're fine.
No, thank you.

208
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:38,068
My maid, whose name is, um...

209
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,427
Bernice?
Somewhat obviously.

210
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:42,497
Bernice! Yes, Bernice.

211
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,685
And she was dead drunk
in a nearby saloon.

212
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:46,907
Poor thing.
(Chuckles)

213
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,099
The curse of the Irish,
and so forth.

214
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,251
Ah, jeez.
Well, let's get her inside.

215
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,654
No! Oh, no.
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,904
- No. We'll use this one.
- No, no, no.

217
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,990
- That... that one's good.
- Let's... No, this one!

218
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,215
No! We are not
going through

219
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,609
a revolving door with Bernice.

220
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:05,068
But it wastes so much
less air conditioning

221
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,261
than a regular door.

222
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,825
The regular door
is wide-ass open!

223
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,304
Oh, right.
Well, then, what's the point?

224
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:12,825
Exactly.

225
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,653
(Bell dings)
Honestly,

226
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,232
I don't know why
you're so angry.

227
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,716
Which I think is why I'm so angry.
(Bell dings)

228
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,006
- And I can see why you would be.
- Trexler: Oh, yeah?

229
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,112
I mean, you don't think
I'm being unreasonable?

230
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,685
No! I mean, no.. I mean...

231
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,575
Because not only
did I pay a lot of money

232
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,620
for those magical
disappearing whores,

233
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,185
I also paid you a lot of money.

234
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:34,966
Well, yes, but that was...

235
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:37,435
I mean, that was more
to look the other way, so...

236
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:39,263
Figuratively!

237
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,810
Not literally,

238
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:43,255
while those assholes
were taking my load!

239
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:45,998
(Clears throat)

240
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:48,116
Do you have a cat?
I smell dander.

241
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,208
Now, you listen to me,
figgis, you<i> schnorrer.</i>

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,347
You're gonna find my whores,

243
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,220
and you are gonna find
the bastards who took my whores,

244
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,255
and crippled
my right-hand man, or...

245
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:58,068
Or... I'm just
spit-balling here...

246
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,317
what if I just gave you
back the money?

247
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:03,296
Because I do not want the money!

248
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:07,490
That is why I exchanged the
money for goods and/or services,

249
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,200
which is the core concept
of economics.

250
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,991
Isn't it sugar?

251
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,996
Or, like, scarcity...
of sugar?

252
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:17,950
You got one week, figgis.
Or else.

253
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,437
Wow. Goosebumps.

254
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,990
Cyril:<i> A week?</i>

255
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,651
How in the risen Christ am I supposed
to find them in a week? I...

256
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,068
I don't even know where to think
about thinking to start looking!

257
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,138
(Chattering in Chinese)
Okay, okay! Okay!

258
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,917
Okay! Goddamn it!
(Chattering stops)

259
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,599
Okay. I got to go to work,
but I'll be back tonight.

260
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,660
And when I get back, I
wouldn't mind if the place

261
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,123
smelled like lemon pledge
and orange chicken.

262
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,927
Mm, maybe Chinatown?

263
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:47,029
Oh, yeah. Hey, and while we're
at it, why not regular China?

264
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,107
Or maybe sarcastic island,

265
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:50,734
off the coast of
that was uncalled for.

266
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,982
- Will you shut up?
- Gladly.

267
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,154
And then ask yourself...
Cui bono?

268
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:57,256
Archer:<i> What?</i>

269
00:10:57,342 --> 00:11:00,607
I said, "why was your
office ransacked?"

270
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,311
Because somebody
killed my partner

271
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:05,037
and he left an envelope
full of clues in the safe.

272
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,420
Why on earth would he do that?

273
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,522
What? No, not the killer, my...

274
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,279
And what on earth are you doing?

275
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,342
Trying to offset
some of the blue.

276
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,795
She looks like
a-a rodeo clown.

277
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,904
You've clearly
never been to a rodeo.

278
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,700
Must you rob this poor girl

279
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,898
of her very last
shred of dignity?

280
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,225
You did that! You did that when
you stuffed her in the trunk

281
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,826
of your Rolls-Royce,
you spoiled little...

282
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,801
(Muffled grunting)

283
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,178
- Wait. Really?
- Mm!

284
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,311
Oh...

285
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:36,679
Okay.

286
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,506
(Muffled grunting)

287
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,889
(Zipper unzips)

288
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,417
Oh! Cover her face.

289
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,272
(Chuckles)
Wait, what?

290
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:46,436
I don't want her watching us.

291
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,092
(Chuckles)
Oh. Okay.

292
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:53,808
So...

293
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,795
Why did someone
murder your partner?

294
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,842
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

295
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,061
Really? I would
think<i> who</i>

296
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:03,459
- is much more important than<i> why.</i>
- I...

297
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,217
Because if you found
out who killed him,

298
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,039
you could make them
tell you why.

299
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,740
Wow, you're
a regular monsieur...

300
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,404
And last night,

301
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,186
whoever, or whoevers,
broke into your office

302
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:16,348
presumably knew
you'd be elsewhere.

303
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,350
- I... huh?
- So,

304
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:20,131
who knew you wouldn't be there?

305
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,842
Well, I mean, it was late
at night. There was no reason

306
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:26,848
for anybody to think
I would be at the office, so...

307
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:28,053
Pam:<i> You lost me.</i>

308
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:30,537
Cyril:
<i>"Cui bono," you dummy.</i> It's Latin.

309
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,227
It means "To whose profit."
So?

310
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,740
So, who knew you
wouldn't be there?

311
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:41,686
So, you big ox,
when Trexler loses...

312
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,686
Who gains?

313
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,865
Cheryl: Oh, come now.
Don't be such a pout.

314
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,589
I think getting Bernice
through the lobby

315
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,700
went about as well
as could reasonably be expected.

316
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:04,802
(Clattering)
(Barking)

317
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,465
(Groaning)

318
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,592
(Clears throat)
Sorry.

319
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,371
- Besides,
- if... If you don't shut your fat mouth,

320
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,435
it's gonna be you going
over that goddamn cliff

321
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,685
instead of Bernice!

322
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,553
Please!
Then you'd never get paid.

323
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,678
(Tires screech)

324
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,990
It would be worth it.

325
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:27,795
What's this?
Why have we stopped?

326
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,019
To get some answers.
I won't be long. Stay here.

327
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,834
I shall do nothing of the sort.

328
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,154
(Sighs)
Of course you shalln't.

329
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,546
Why, the very idea...

330
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:38,622
sitting in a car in the street
like some sort of...

331
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,451
- Dirty cop.
- Well, or any tradesman, really.

332
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,076
- Oh!
- I need you to stop talking.

333
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,310
And when we get in there,
I need you to continue

334
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,256
to stop talking to anybody.

335
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:49,428
You're hurting me!
(Whimpers)

336
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:52,560
And it's the highlight
of my day.

337
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,029
(Exclaims in German)

338
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,967
(Speaking German)

339
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,514
- Archer: Do what?
- What?

340
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,537
- What?
- What do you want?

341
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,804
- Couple minutes with Mother.
- (Scoffs) Knock yourself out.

342
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,201
Well, I'm sorry
I can't be of more help

343
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:07,776
to you, lieutenant, but...

344
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,217
"Can't" and "won't"

345
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,240
are two very different things,
Mother.

346
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,084
And yet the end result
is still the same.

347
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,537
Why, Mr. Archer.

348
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:16,912
- Mother.
- Archer.

349
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,037
- Figgis.
- Archer.

350
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,700
Poovey.
You look like shit.

351
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,295
(Sighs)
Couldn't sleep.

352
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,503
- Noisy house guests.
- What do you mean, "House guests"?

353
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:27,129
(Chuckles) Wouldn't they be cave guests?

Ooh.
We don't.

Aw. And now that
we've settled that,

if you two
will please excuse us?

359

Okay, Mother,
but remember what I told you.

Remember what <i>I</i> told<i> you.</i>

It is just dandertown frolics.

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,715
Move, dick!

364
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:51,192
Slang for "detective,"
so not an insult!

365
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:55,098
What is insulting is that you've
kept me waiting for ten hours.

366
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,629
I... sorry.
I've had a busy day.

367
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,575
Malory: I'll bet. I've had
quite a busy day myself

368
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,991
trying to shut down rumors

369
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,371
I had anything to do with

370
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,418
that bloodbath
down in long beach.

371
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,064
I wouldn't say
"Bloodbath."

372
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:09,590
No, although, now that
I come to think of it,

373
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:11,138
the easiest thing
would be to just

374
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,621
tell Len Trexler it was you.

375
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,575
That would be pretty easy.

376
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,278
But I have another job for you.

377
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,395
Great. Come back at midnight.
I'll give you the details.

378
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,652
- And don't be late again.
- Um, okay.

379
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,060
- Anything else?
- Well, uh,

380
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:29,364
it's just that
while I was down in Long Beach,

381
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:32,012
somebody broke into my office
and tossed the place.

382
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:34,410
And? And, well, I
mean, it's just,

383
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:36,598
not many people knew
I wouldn't be there.

384
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,059
In your office, late at night.

385
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,731
- Yes.
- And?

386
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:44,398
And I will see you at midnight.

387
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:49,452
No, it's just, what's
a society dame like you

388
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,124
doing in a place like this?

389
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,108
Leaving it. Let's go.

390
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:55,927
- Wha... rude!
- Bernice is waiting.

391
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,429
Oh, right.

392
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:58,929
(Gasps)
Miss Kane!

393
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:01,558
Archer.

394
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:04,475
Wow. Fancy meeting
you here, huh?

395
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:08,407
At my job? Yeah. I mean,
what are the odds?

396
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:10,897
- One to one?
- Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.

397
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,749
So, um...

398
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,808
Yeah. So, uh, okay.

399
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,996
See... see you
around, or...

400
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,465
(Gasps) Oh, my God!
You have a crush on her!

401
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,910
What? No I don't. I...

402
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,785
Yes, you do!
That was the cutest thing!

403
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:30,847
And I think she has
a crush on you.

404
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,808
- No, she.. Wait. Really?
- Absolutely!

405
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,699
Why-Why... Why do you
think that? Did she...

406
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,668
Just admit that you like her.

407
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,996
- Well, yeah. I mean, of course I..
- Hey! Yeah.

408
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,816
Me and him?
We just (Bleep)!

409
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,994
What is wrong with you?

410
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,227
Well, for one thing,

411
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:51,971
I may be literally
starving to death.

412
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,400
- (Gasps) Clams!
- What?

413
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:57,119
Oh, we should stop
for fried clams

414
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:59,803
at one of those
darling little shacks.

415
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,580
Archer: We're not
stopping for fried clams.

416
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,498
There is a dead woman
in the trunk!

417
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,807
Well, obviously, I meant after.

418
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,424
Also, I think
we're being followed.

419
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,408
What? We're not
being followed.

420
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:11,041
There aren't any headlights
back there.

421
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,307
I think their headlights are off.
No, they're not,

422
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,861
because it's pitch dark and
we're not being followed!

423
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,822
- I think we're being followed.
- We're not being followed!

424
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:22,768
And also, how have you
not been murdered?

425
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,557
I think we're being f...
(Tires screech)

426
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,127
We are not being followed!

427
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,127
I am a trained
private investigator!

428
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,557
If we were being followed,
I would know it!

429
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,941
- Fine. Then drive.
- Actually, we're here.

430
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:38,457
(Trunk opens)

431
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:40,908
Sorry, Bernice.
Won't be long.

432
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,638
Okay. So, I'm gonna soak
the upholstery with gas,

433
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:45,588
set a 20-second
cordite fuse,

434
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,399
then we'll put Bernice
in the driver's seat,

435
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,916
jam a rock on the accelerator,

436
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,416
light the fuse,
and then slam it into... oh!

437
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,182

438

00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:14,105

Our headlights don't work!

(Blows raspberry)
Ow. (Groans)

448
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:30,345
Well?
Are we doing this or what?

449
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,196
Because if I don't
get some clams soon,

450
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:35,204
I won't be responsible
for my actions.

451
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,579
What? I told you
we were being followed.

452
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,805
(Grunts) That was just a car
with broken headlights.

453
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,344
It was a coincidence.
(Grunts)

454
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,602
Because we weren't
being followed!
