<i>[malory]</i>
<i>I am dead serious.</i>

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,705
<i>From now on, no eggs,</i>
<i>no pigs' feet,</i>

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,173
<i>Nothing pickled,</i>

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,675
Or, so help me god,

5
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,144
I will put that refrigerator
out by the curb.

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,645
[woman] what?
[man] oh, come on!

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,114
Those weren't pigs' feet.

8
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,115
[all groan]

9
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,385
Whatever feet, idiot!

10
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,153
Now then, we have
an assignment,

11
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,955
But I won't be joining you,

12
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,324
So if you'll direct your
goldfish-like attention spans

13
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,725
To mr. Slater...

14
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,528
Just slater,
for the "infinitieth" time.

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,063
Watch it.
Shut up.

16
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,297
Burn.
Shut up.

17
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,899
[whispers]
burn.

18
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,067
Okay...
[remote clicks]

19
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,235
The young man
in the monitor

20
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,003
Is crown prince fawad fawaz,

21
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,172
Heir to the throne
of the kingdom of durhan.

22
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,307
He just got a summer internship
on wall street...

23
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,176
Ugh, affirmative action...

24
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:48,180
And so he's in the city looking
for suitable accommodations,

25
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,182
Something befitting
the world's richest prince.

26
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,084
[man] oh, money.
Holy shit.

27
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,019
And so what,
he needs bodyguards?

28
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,755
Mm, no,
I think he's all set there...

29
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,524
[overlapping clamoring]

30
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,059
Which brings us
to my problem,

31
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,428
Which, coincidentally,
is also your problem.

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,863
Without the prince or his
security team's knowledge,

33
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,866
I need to scan any and all
of his mobile phones,

34
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,435
Any and all flash drives,

35
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,770
Both of his handprints,
and both of his retinas.

36
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
And why?

37
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,107
Oh, sorry,
let me back up.

38
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,109
This is part of
operation because I said so.

39
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,211
Ya know what?
I'm sure I do.

40
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,114
For example,
this is a tranquilizer gun,

41
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,849
With which I will dart
the prince,

42
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,218
And then we'll have 60
seconds to do all the scans

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,220
Before he wakes up
with no side effects

44
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,355
And no memory at all
of the previous few minutes.

45
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,792
Bullshit, the cia
doesn't have that technolo--

46
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,961
But before
I can tranquilize him,

47
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,563
I need access
to the prince, so--

48
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,198
Uh, and just so we're clear,

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,633
He's the prince of durhan,
an allied country.

50
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,436
Yeah, I'm gonna refer you back
to operation said so.

51
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,805
Everybody else, these are
your mission dossiers.

52
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,307
Read them on the way
to tunt manor.

53
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,776
[gasps]
tunt manor? That's my house!

54
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,910
[mocking]
I know!

55
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,912
And the prince
is on his way there,

56
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,247
And so we're going there,

57
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,715
And because you know
the property,

58
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,450
You'll be posing
as the listing agent!

59
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,285
[gasps, squeals]

60
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,254
Shut up!
Burn!

61
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,423
Well, just in case
I don't read this...

62
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,091
What are the rest of us
gonna be doing?

63
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,128
Some of you will be assisting
me and/or miss tunt.

64
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,964
The rest of you
will be distracting
the prince's security team

65
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,265
And/or his mother...

66
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,167
Her majesty,
queen yasmin fawaz.

67
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,769
[man] whoa, shit.
[woman, gasping] damn.

68
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,304
[pants crinkling]

69
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,639
Seriously?

70
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,574
What?
I just heard
you get hard.

71
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,009
[women] ew.
[man groans]

72
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,511
They were goat feet,

73
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,246
And you threw 'em out!

74
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,181
Ah, damn you!

75
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,084
God damn
you all to hell!

76
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,089
So... The van's
downstairs.

77
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,692
<i>â™ª [archer theme]</i>

78
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,532
[man]
turn around.
Now spread your arms.

79
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,901
[metal detector squeals]
I do apologize for this
necessary precaution,

80
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,337
Miss...
Oh, uh--

81
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,039
What do I always
tell you?

82
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,307
Never apologize.

83
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,075
It is a sign
of weakness.

84
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,343
Yes, mother.

85
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,645
So, miss...
Uh... Escrow.

86
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,981
My last name is escrow.
Really?

87
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,718
Yes, and trust me,
I've heard all the jokes.

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,987
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>oh, boy.</i>

89
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,656
Okay, chinstrap,
let me see what we got
on the other cameras.

90
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,059
Bathroom one,
bathroom two,
bathroom three,

Bathroom four,
bathroom five--

92
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,429
Are all the cameras
in bathrooms?

93
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,997
No. Just my faves.
[tapping anew]

Bathroom six,
bathroom seven, bathr--

95
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,569
Shoulda gotten
some poison ones.

96
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,205
Okay, people,
I want you in position
in five minutes.

97
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,675
You should've thought
of that before you picked
these ridiculous costumes,

98
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,911
And why are your plans
always so complicated?

99
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,514
You're like
wile e. Coyote with access
to predator drones. Out.

100
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,783
[pam]
I think these uniforms
are awesome!

101
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,118
Here, let me get
some pics of you!

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,886
To masturbate to?

103
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,756
[laughing]
pfff, please.

104
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,124
Please?

105
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,293
Can somebody explain
to me why the cia

106
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,362
Is spying on
american allies?

107
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,864
Well, ray,
there were these things
called dinosaurs,

108
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,433
And when they died,
they turned into oil, somehow,

109
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,535
And that's what
your car uses for food.

110
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,737
[archer]
thanks, al.

111
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,205
[cyril] al?
Jazeera!

112
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,107
Look, for all we know,
slater wants all that stuff

113
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,243
Because the cia is trying
to protect the royal family.

114
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,279
From what?
Cabals.

115
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,380
[laughs]
what?

116
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,415
Yes, sinister cabals!

117
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,717
I bet the royal palace
is lousy with them.

118
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,253
So instead of trying to
undermine the mission...

119
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,289
Don't undermine it!

120
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,057
What the heck got into him?

121
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,760
More like what he wants
to get into,

122
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,561
Which, obviously,
the queen's vagina.

123
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,397
[sighs]
seriously?

124
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,965
Or wherever else.

125
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,000
Although she didn't look
like a back dorothy.

126
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,903
[sighs]
well we'll just see
about that...

127
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,105
The part about archer
having sex with the queen,

128
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,342
Not the part about
the queen being into anal sex.
Who knows?

129
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,344
Wow.
This is eerily similar

130
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:15,514
To my spec script for
<i>masterpiece theater.</i>
<i>Your what?</i>

131
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,250
Well, I guess
technically it's fanfic.

132
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,620
Bringing us
to the formal dining room,
which seats 80,

133
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:25,257
With plenty of room
for servants to skulk around,

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,859
Ladling turtle soup
into sterling silver bowls,

135
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,430
Their sullen eyes downcast
as grandmamÃ¡ makes a joke

136
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,764
About chopping off
their hands

137
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,866
If they spill
even a single drop,

138
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,704
Like we used to do
in the belgian congo.

139
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,972
Hm. And how about
that chandelier, huh?

140
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,042
[chuckling]
but I wouldn't wanna dust it!

141
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,111
An opinion apparently
shared by the staff

142
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,679
About the rest
the furnishings.

143
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,614
If this were my palace, I'd--
[door opens]

144
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,850
What did I tell you, wench?
Ow!

145
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,452
Stop right there!
Who are you?

146
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,354
I am... Butler.

147
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,621
The butler.

148
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,858
Wait, your name
is butler, or--?

149
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,362
Both!
And I've heard every joke!

150
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,330
My sincere apologies,
your majesty,

151
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,165
For the deplorable state
of the house.

152
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,400
Good help
is difficult to find,

153
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,535
As I'm sure
your majesty well knows.

154
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,671
What I know,
you impudent toad,

155
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,073
Is that if a servant dared
speak to me in my palace,

156
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,976
I would have him sewn into
a burlap sack filled with rats,

157
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,578
And the sack thrown
into the river.

158
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,813
Burn!
[grunts]

159
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,982
Well slapped,
your majesty.

160
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,851
Come! Let's get
this over with

161
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,553
So I can bathe off
all this filth and grime.

162
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,389
Oh, my god,
can you believe this?

163
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,656
What?
What?

164
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,192
My commission
is gonna be huge!

165
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,994
[queen yasmin]
come, you foolish woman!

166
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,729
Coming, my majesty!

167
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,065
Now, is anyone allergic
to ocelots?

168
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh, that's right,
babou!

169
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,503
Ow, man,
what a hate-slappin' bitch.

170
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,372
Yeah, I gotta have sex
with her.
Wait, what?

171
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,242
But I thought you and lana
were kinda, you know...

172
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,077
Kinda, you know, what?
What'd she say?

173
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,913
Well, nothing, but--
see? Classic lana!

174
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,048
So what, you're gonna try
to bang the queen

175
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,417
Just to make lana jealous?

176
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,385
No.
That'll just be icing

177
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,623
On what I assume will be
an extremely moist cake...
Blorp.

178
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,425
Because I've had sex
with a baroness,

179
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,728
A marquise, a vicomtesse,
the two princess sisters,

180
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,229
Um, a duchess--

181
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,398
[gasps]
your mom's dog?
No.

182
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,300
[gasps]
the wife of a duke?

183
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,869
Yes, but I've never had sex
with a queen.

184
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,907
Yasmin would be my greatest
masterpiece, pam, my--
hang on...

185
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,042
[chuckling]
moaning lisa.

186
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,378
[chuckling]
dammit,
I was gonna say that.

187
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,313
[chuckling]
girl with a pearl necklace.

188
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,950
[laughs]
[laughing]
the potato eaters.

189
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,585
Stop it!
But wait.

190
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,986
Why are you telling me
your plan

191
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,888
To not make lana jealous?

192
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,824
I dunno, I--
oh, my god, pam,

193
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,625
I think you
might be my best friend.

194
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,893
You're my best friend!

195
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,128
What about cheryl?

196
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,230
You're my second
best friend!

197
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,098
Oh, my god...
What?

198
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,568
Eh, I thought by now
I'd be doing a lot better

199
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,436
In the old
friend department.

200
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,438
[chuckles]
I thought by now
I'd be dead.

201
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,973
Well, day's not over...

202
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,974
[chuckling]
right?

203
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,275
He what?

204
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,677
I mean-- so what?

205
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,745
Well, I just figured
you'd wanna know.

206
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,447
No, you just figured
it would make me jealous,

207
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,949
But, spoiler alert,

208
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,017
I don't give a shit
who archer bangs.

209
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,587
Well, yeah, no,
but if you did,

210
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,156
And you wanted
to make archer jealous...

211
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,591
Then I'd go break
my pussy off

212
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,459
On that hot little
prince's merguez.

213
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,462
Exactly, that's what I'm--
wait, what?

214
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,097
Which,
come to think of it,

215
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,333
Would be what my vagina
refers to as a "win-win."

216
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,767
But wait a minute!
Love to, can't,

217
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,169
Got a pussy to break.

218
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,906
[sighs]
well, that backfired.

219
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,009
Or did it?

220
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,046
Yes, yes,
it most certainly did.

221
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,219
[slater]
okay, people, listen up.

222
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,721
If you're not in position,

223
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,155
You'd better get there
a.S.A.P. Because--

224
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,291
Uh, what's that?

225
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,059
[sighs]
because right about now,

226
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,161
Cheryl should be leading
the durhanis into...

227
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,198
[cheryl/carol]
the world-renowned
conservatory!

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,834
[slater]
where gillette should be ready
with a transdermal solution

229
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,969
Of the most powerful
laxative known to man.

230
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,372
[whisper]
I-- dammit,
I had something for this--

231
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,641
Wait, was it
something about dukes?

232
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,143
[cheryl/carol]
the tunt conservatory
is home to the world's

233
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,546
Second largest collection
of carnivorous plants,

234
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,080
The shame of which drove

235
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,849
The current owners'
eccentric great-uncle,

236
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,018
Theophilus tunt,
to commit suicide.

237
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,653
Or maybe it was
just the syphilis.

238
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,054
We may never know,

239
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,489
And, frankly,
it's none of our b--

240
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,257
Bathroom?
[queen yasmin]
what?

241
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,725
I'm sorry, your majesty,

242
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,727
I don't know what's wrong,
but I need to--

243
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,095
Mother!
Silence!

244
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,697
How dare you?

245
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,167
Indeed.
Well slapped, his majesty.

246
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,403
Now,
if you will follow me,
into the--

247
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,872
Bathroom!
Please, your majesty!
I cannot wait!

248
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,575
I told you idiots
that wasn't the real
famous ray's!

249
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,511
A thousand pardons.
Foolish woman!
Where is a bathroom?

250
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,380
Where isn't a bathroom?
[laughs]

251
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,282
Am I right?
[laughs]

252
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,284
All kidding aside, though,
the house does have

253
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,553
22 full
and 18 half-baths,

254
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,089
All boasting priceless
grueby faience tilework,

255
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,458
As well as--

256
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,695
Cucumber water bidets!
[bodyguards passing gas]

257
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,699
Now, if your assorted
majesties and highnesses
will please follow me...

258
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,702
To elevator number three,
where whats-her-face
should be standing by...

259
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,704
10-4 on the 20,
come back.

260
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,872
Stop it!
She will bring
the prince upstairs,

261
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,375
Where archer and lana are
waiting to bring him to me--

262
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,576
<i>[archer over speaker]</i>
<i>what? Wait, what?</i>

263
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,944
What?
What's that?

264
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,647
Are you in position?
Yes?

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,815
<i>[archer]</i>
<i>yeah, I am...</i>

266
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,216
So I'm not really sure

267
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,452
Why you're using
that pissy tone with me--

268
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,886
<i>[slater]</i>
<i>I--</i>
<i>unless I sound like lana,</i>

00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,656
Looking around the position,

271
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,592
And she is...

272
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,228
Not in position.
Well, where the hell is she?

273
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,930
Yeah. Stand by?

274
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,099

Ow!

Hey, speaking of lana

280
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,310
Cyril, I either can't
or merely don't want to talk
right now, so--

00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,079
Cowgirl? Wheelbarrow?
Butter churn?

282
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,516

okay, gollum, you have won
the game of riddles.

291
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,769
So, that backfired...

292
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,637
Maybe I should work
on my timing.

00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,144
Please... Someone...
Just kill me...

00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,312
Be careful
what you wish for!

296
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,548
Especially
if it's claustrophobic,

297
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,185
Manually-operated elevators!

298
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,787
Because this is what
you would get.

299
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,188
And I am embarrassed
to say

300
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,624
That I have room
for only one passenger.

302

What?

00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,730
Return!
I shall take his highness,

If it please your majesty,
take the elevator.

309
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,745
I will escort his highness
upstairs via...

310
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,346
A more scenic route.

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,187
Mother, this sounds
like a win-win.

315
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,922
Pardon,
but I'm supposed to--

316
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,759
Mother!
Woman, I will kill you
where you stand!

317
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,828
Which, by law
I'm required to tell you,

318
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,730
If there's been a murder
in the house--

319
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,832
Oh, but if you
were the murderer...

about this job!

I shall meet you
upstairs momentarily.

00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,112
Mind you, do not tarry.

326
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,213
Well?

327
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,447
Blorp.

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,682

what the hell?

329
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,453
Where is everybody?

here! Present!

00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,055
Hey, where's lana?
What the--

331
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,523
Well, she's not in here,

332
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,024
Which is where you also
shouldn't be!

333
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,292
What?
What?

334
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,894
Why aren't you
in position?

335
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,229
Because, slater,
there's a--

336
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,197
A problem with
your tranquilizer gun.

337
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,465
What problem?

338
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,969
It goes off for, like,
no reason.

339
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,205
Where's lana?
I'm not even
a hundred percent sure

00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,217
Good, get off,
keep this channel open.

345
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,553
<i>No, I need you guys to--</i>
<i>keep this channel open!</i>

346
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,722
[glass shattering]

347
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,424
God, these people.
Always "me, me, me."

348
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,994
Hey, pretty girl...

349
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,496
Or boy, or gender-fluid,

350
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,065
Or however
you self-identify,

351
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,801
It's all good.

352
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,104
Although that being said...
Hyahh!

353
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,873
[screams]

354
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,314
[sighs]
blorp.

355
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,822
[slater yawns]

356
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,491
Okay, let's do this!

357
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,426
Whats-yer-face, pam,
what's your--

358
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,095
What the shit?
[sleepy]
what's that?

359
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,864
Hey, you.

360
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,866
What the hell
are you people doing?

361
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,203
Thinking about some breakfast,
am I right?

362
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,104
Oh, my god, chilaquiles?

363
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:05,176
What the--? Where the hell
is my tranquilizer gun?
Your what?

364
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,711
[lana]
your highness?

365
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,113
Could you help me in here,
please?

366
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,449
And so, beckoned
by the servant,

367
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,485
A powerful negress giant,
fawad entered the boudoir

368
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,154
And soon became a man...

369
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,622
[gasps]

370
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,525
I seem to have fallen.

371
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,195
I-- I seem
to see that...

372
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,030
Can you help me up...

373
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,199
Or vice versa?

374
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,535
I think perhaps both?
Ideally?

375
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,137
Or rather, both,
ideally, would be--
[grunts]

376
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,042
Hello? Prince?

377
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,312
Kid, c'mon, I mean,
I know I've been crushing
the post-natal yoga, but--

378
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,214
Seriously,
did you have a stroke?

379
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,383
[archer, chuckling]
seriously?
[gasps]

380
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,719
You honestly thought you were
so physically attractive

381
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,222
That you caused a healthy
young man to literally--

382
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,526
To literally...
Have a, um... Uh...

383
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,028
Stroke?

384
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,331
[pants crinkle]
[slater]
seriously?

385
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,234
Well, you better hope I get
all this shit scanned
before he wakes--

386
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,737
What's that?
I couldn't hear you
over the sound of--

387
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,940
Seriously, just yoga?
He said, jealously.

388
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,276
Oh, my god, if anybody's
jealous, it's you.

389
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,912
Hang on, shut up,
I have something for this...

390
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,347
Lana cougar mellencamp!
What?

391
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,082
Look at him!
He's a child!

392
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,385
He's 21! I think!

393
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,454
Which is more than I can say
for most of your
sexual partners!

394
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,225
What? I-- that--
I mean, even if that were
technically true, it's--

395
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,860
It's what,
painfully obvious

396
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,361
That the reason you try
to drag your dick

397
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,562
Through every attractive
woman you meet

398
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,730
Is because
you're not over me?

399
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,099
Oh, my god!

400
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,269
And just when their anger
reaches a fever pitch,

401
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,271
In walks figgis.

402
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,941
I can't even formulate
a response to that!

403
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,776
Because you can't argue
with the truth!

404
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,579
I can! And if anybody's
not over anybody, it's you!

405
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,849
With your-- your--
your-- your-- your--

406
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,487
Timing.

407
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,127
Um, excuse me?
Hello?

408
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,497
[screams]

409
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,899
Jesus, my ear balls!

410
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,634
Um...

411
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,235
Oh.
So, here's the thing
with that...

412
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,737
[camera shutter clicks]

413
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,073
[chuckles]
I'll be seein'
you two later...

414
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,808
Guards!

415
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,776
[dart whooshes]
gua--!

416
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,278
So... Not great.

417
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,579
Uh, could be worse.

418
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,947
[man]
coming, your majesty!

419
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,082
Case in point.

420
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,718
[yelling]

421
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,189
[chuckling]
yeah, they are gonna
kill everybody.

422
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,424
Well, dammit!
I'll have to disclose that!

423
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,259
Will somebody
do something?

424
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,794
Yeah, lana,
get his pants off.

425
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,463
[groans]
inappropes, honey.

426
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,698
[gasps]
wait, were they screwing?

427
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,800
Hey! If anybody tells
mother about this, I'll--

428
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,103
Wait, what?
[slater]
what the shit?

429
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,106
You idiots!
What did you do?
Hey, whoa! First of all,

430
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,009
Your plan was way
too complicated.
Maybe for you people!

431
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,945
It had everything but a sign
for free bird seed,

432
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,146
And second of all...

433
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,280
[gun clicks]
what the--?

434
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,682
[clicking]
huh. I was wondering

435
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,217
How many rounds
this little guy held...

436
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,885
[guards yelling]

437
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,387
Oh, shit.
Oh, my god,
we're gonna die.

438
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,654
I gotta
get outta here!

439
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,356
If they find out
the cia was behind this,

440
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,125
It'll be
an international incident!

441
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,060
Yeah, god forbid
you guys get caught.

442
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,329
Hello, front desk?
Watergate hotel?

443
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,498
This is the bay of pigs,
in room 61.

444
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,200
Could you send up
1,500 poorly-trained
cuban exiles?

445
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,468
Ooh, and ice!

446
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,337
[sighs]
you done?

447
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,172
Yes, that's right,
and a bucket of ice.

448
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,008
Hmm? What's that?
No, we won't be needing
any air cover.

449
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,309
Click. Now I'm done.

450
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,980
[men growling]

451
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,315
Then can we--
carol,
I'm assuming all the bedrooms

452
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,884
Are connected
to secret passages?

453
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,319
Yeah, so that at night
grandfather could...

454
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,754
Look in on the children.

455
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,257
[all groaning]
[pam] ew.

456
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,592
Okay, everybody in,
and make sure you swing by

457
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,528
And get krieger and ray
on your way out.

458
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,096
Yeah, where is ray?

459
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,265
[grunting]
[plans sloshing]

460
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,436
[spade clangs]

461
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,238
Well, I gotta hand
it to you...

462
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,407
[laughs]

463
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,511
[laughs maniacally]

464
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,114
[yelling]

465
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,415
Wait,
what about you guys?

466
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,416
Uh, we're going to...

467
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,517
Um... Uh...

468
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,386
Beat 'em off--
hold them off,

469
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,722
So you guys
can get away, to--
safety

470
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:12,957
Or wherever.

471
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,358
[chuckling]
uh-huh.

472
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,426
[camera shutter clicks]

473
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,463
[sighs]

474
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,132
Okay, so obviously
we'll need to talk

475
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,433
About what just happened,

476
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,802
So... Um...

477
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,970
Shitter?

478
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,872
Or wherever.

479
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,640
[gasping]

480
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,875
Your majesty!

481
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,376
What in the...
Mother?

482
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,945
Your highness!
Your majesty!

483
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,481
You're alive!
Tear this place apart!

484
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,916
[man]
and when we find
these american pigs,

485
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,886
They will eat their own eyes
before we kill them!

486
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,754
[archer]
oh, my god...

487
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,290
Lana! It's like--
it's like

488
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,726
The danger makes
it that much hotter!

489
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:52,530
Yeah, yeah, that,
plus your dick!

490
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,234
<i>Right?</i>

491
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,335
[potato chip crunches]

492
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,669
[mouth full]
totally.

493
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,404
[archer]
oh, my god...

494
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,242
[malory]
well, I hope you're all pleased

495
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,610
With yourselves...

496
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,346
Because thanks
to your latest fiasco,

497
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,115
After he makes a formal
protest at the u.N. Tomorrow,

498
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,918
The durhani ambassador
is being recalled.

499
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,154
Which--
it was all slater's fault!

500
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,623
Sterling,
I swear to god--

501
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,792
Malory it was, he--
and why are you taking
sterling's side?

502
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,094
Because...

503
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,163
Shut up!
[gasps]
burn!

504
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,431
Slater's plan was just--
[cheryl/carol]
fakakta!

505
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,301
And I was counting
on that commission,
and now the homeowners

506
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,537
Are taking the house
off the market.

507
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,207
You do realize
you're the homeowner.
Still though.

508
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,476
Oh, shut up,
and unless there's
anything else,

509
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,944
You can all get out.

510
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,979
Actually, there is one
other thing.

511
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,681
What?

512
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,551
[laughing]
I think ray deserves a hand.

513
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,719
[all laughing]

514
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,057
God dammit!

515
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,893
Oh, come on, we were
all thinking it...

516
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,763
[laughing]
