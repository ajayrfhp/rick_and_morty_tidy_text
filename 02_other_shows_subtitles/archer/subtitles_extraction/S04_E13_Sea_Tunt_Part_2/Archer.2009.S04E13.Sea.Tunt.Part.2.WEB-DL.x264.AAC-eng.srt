1
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:04,834
MURPHY (O.S.): Time and
tide, they wait for no man.

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:08,137
MURPHY: Nor do I, Mr. Tunt, nor do I.
And unless my demands are

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,307
met, I will launch my nerve
gas missiles on New York,

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,177
Washington and Miami in...
Eleven hours and -- oh look at

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:17,780
that, eleven minutes.
Hey, make a wish.

6
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:21,150
CECIL: Uh, I wish you wouldn't
launch nerve gas missiles on

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,351
New York, Washing-
MURPHY: And I wish you fools

8
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:27,757
would stop destroying the oceans! Overfishing,
industrial runoff, don't even get me

9
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:31,231
started on whaling, oh, and
plastic bottles?! That's --

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:35,197
I can't even - there is a floating
mass of garbage in the Pacific

11
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,334
twice the size of the United States!
Oh, and where the hell

12
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,202
is the news crew I asked for?!

13
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:44,640
CECIL: With me! And with your permission,
I'm sending them down in the DSV.

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,610
MURPHY: Good, yes! I need to
get my message to the world!

15
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,078
Who'd you get? Oprah?

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,312
CECIL: Bigger.

17
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:52,615
LANA: Ya know...
MURPHY: Hello. Is that her?

18
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:55,585
LANA: I -- oh right,
he can't see us.

19
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:58,821
MURPHY: Which has really got me...
nettled!

20
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:05,862
MURPHY: Alright, Mr. Tunt, send them down.
But if this is some sort of ruse...

21
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:09,264
CECIL: Are -- was there
a follow-up, or...?

22
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:11,000
MURPHY: No, I was leaving
the consequences to your

23
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:16,105
imagination. But trust me, they are grave.
As in watery grave?

24
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:18,440
CECIL: I -
MURPHY: Sealab out!

25
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,844
God damn it! Off! Turn
off, you... [zzzrpt]

26
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:26,248
LANA: So, I have a question...
MALORY: How are none of these a minibar?!

27
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:29,218
TIFFY: Oh my God, I know what
you mean, right? I mean it is a

28
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,920
giant floating biodiesel-

29
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,555
powered hotel room...

30
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:33,723
MALORY: Don't get snotty with

31
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:36,792
me, missy! You people lure us
out here to help the government

32
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:39,562
recover a hydrogen bomb-
LANA: Which, let's be honest,

33
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:40,997
you were going to
hold for ransom.

34
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,733
MALORY: Reward! When the whole
time you knew this crazy Murphy

35
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:46,636
character was going to bomb
New York with nerve gas?!

36
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:47,302
CECIL: Well!

37
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:49,104
LANA: Not to mention D.C.
and Miami.

38
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,840
MALORY: Which no one
who matters will miss.

39
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,474
LANA: What about your
South Beach condo?

40
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,177
MALORY: Hello! Florida real
estate collapse! It's farther

41
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:59,114
underwater than Sealab. But if
my homeowner's policy covers

42
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,350
nerve gas attacks,
that's a win-win.

43
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:05,588
LANA: Wow. So my question,
ignoring the obvious one of why

44
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,190
an ocean research lab has nerve
gas missiles in the first

45
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:12,327
place! Is how many men
does Murphy have?

46
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,830
CECIL: Mmmmmlike, two?

47
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:15,965
LANA: Oh, then -

48
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,466
CECIL: Score. Two score, so

49
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,135
around forty, sorry, should've

50
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:21,303
finished that thmmpf.

51
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:24,473
LANA: Sooo, since we're talking
about forty hostiles, I

52
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:25,841
have a follow up question.

53
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,878
ARCHER: Something
something danger zone?!

54
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,847
LANA: Ahhhhh!
ARCHER: I know, I'm not even trying anymore.

55
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:34,116
LANA: Archer-
ARCHER: Noop! Randy! I'm

56
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,285
Cameradude Randy, and this

57
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:40,056
pathetic, trout-shouldered excuse
for a boom operator is Chet.

58
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,692
CYRIL: Shut up, what's
pathetic is your plan!

59
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,994
LANA: Wait, you have
an actual plan?

60
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,930
ARCHER: Duh, yes Lana. So,
obviously they're gonna search

61
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:52,367
us for weapons when we get down
there, so wait whaaaaaaaat?

62
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,436
Something else danger zone.

63
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,405
LANA: Get Murphy alone, get
him at gunpoint, and make him

64
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:59,208
disarm the missiles. Ya know,
that might actually work.

65
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,712
ARCHER: Of course it'll work, I've thought
through every aspect of the mission.

66
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:05,781
LANA: Hence those ridiculous
fake mustaches, since Murphy's

67
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:09,118
never seen you before and has
no idea what you look like?

68
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,853
GILLETTE: God damn it, Archer!

69
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:13,856
ARCHER: No, that was just an experiment.
I wanted to see if Ray looked

70
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:15,124
gayer without his.

71
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:20,096
GILLETTE: Ya know...
ARCHER: But you don't. You just look as gay.

72
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:21,230
Boop.

Wait for my command to

75
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:00,037
disengage the coupler.

76
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,706
LANA (O.S.): Roger Sea Tunt, on your-
ARCHER (O.S.): Noop! Lana

77
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:03,540
move, I'm skippering.

78
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,043
EVERYBODY (O.S.): Archer, no!
ARCHER (O.S.): Goddammit I'm skippering!

79
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:08,478
EVERYBODY: AAHHHHH!!!

80
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,682
CECIL: Huh. Mildly
inauspicious.

81
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:13,683
LANA: Asshole.

82
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,453
ARCHER: What Lana, I clearly
called "skipper!" And I clearly

83
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,991
said "seatbelts," so... You
only have yourselves to blame.

84
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:21,725
GILLETTE: Really?

85
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,860

Your nose is broken!

86
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,661
GILLETTE: Really?

87
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,530
LANA: Cyril, gear bag!
First aid kit!

88
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,733
ARCHER: Just give him a couple of tampons.
What, that's their job.

89
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:30,500
LANA: Really?

90
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,702
ARCHER: Just give him some tam-
LANA: I don't have any!

91
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,738
ARCHER: Do you...
think that was wise?

92
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,006
LANA: Meaning?

93
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,342
ARCHER: Well I'm just assuming,
I mean, your breasts

94
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:40,277
are slightly bigger, you're-
LANA: Shut your stupid

95
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:43,513
mustachey dickhole and drive
the goddamn submarine!

96
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,682
ARCHER: Slightly irritable?

97
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,084
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Shut up!

98
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,086
Jesus, will you drop it?!

99
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,921
He tried to have me committed
so he could steal my

100
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:54,391
inheritance! I hate him and I'm
never speaking to him again ever!

101
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,995
PAM: But -- okay granted, that
was super shitty. But trust me,

102
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,197
you don't want to go through
life hating your only sibling.

103
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:04,034
Take my sister Edie...
CHERYL/CAROL: Ha, ha, ha, you have a sister?

104
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,636
PAM: Edie, yes, shut up, and
when we were kids she was so

105
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:10,274
mean to me? Always teasing me,
calling me Spamela, rubbing

106
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:13,577
cheese curds in my eyes? One
time she stabbed me in the neck?

107
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,946
CHERYL/CAROL: So, now you
guys are super-close, or...?

108
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,949
PAM: Ha ha ha, hell no, I wouldn't
piss on her neck-stabbin ass if

109
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,217
it was on fire.

110
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,152
MALORY: Ugh, is this
the infamous Edie?

111
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,121
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, Pam thinks
I should forgive Cecil since

112
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,856
he's the only
family I have left.

113
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:29,093
MALORY: Who could forgive a person who
buys a boat this big with no bar on it?!

114
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,495
CHERYL/CAROL: There was a ton
of booze on the helicopter...

115
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:35,299
MALORY: Exactly, was...
ARCHER (O.S.): Yeah sorry, I had to ditch it.

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,667
CYRIL: Well yeah, who needs a
first aid kit when you've got

117
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:38,835
ten gallons of booze?!

118
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:42,139
ARCHER: Three and three-fifths
gallons, Cyril, and I counted

119
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,573
'em so keep your mitts off!

120
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:48,178
Except to pass me one up here, but-
LANA: Oh great! The world's first DSVUI!

121
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,647
ARCHER: May I finish?! But
since I have zero experience

122
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:54,018
skippering submersibles, I
should probably have something

123
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,288
light! So Cyril, I'm
thinking coffee liqueur?

124
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,924
MALORY: I mean, not
even cooking sherry?

125
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,160
PAM: I got some Kentucky Moon in my-
MALORY: Ooh, gimme!

126
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:05,829
PAM: Dut dut dut dut! You drink
it, you replace it. Grain

127
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,432
alcohol's a key component
of a good bug-out bag.

128
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,433
MALORY: A what?

129
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,969
PAM: Bug-out bag? Oh
my God, for teotwaki?!

130
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,505
MALORY: The bear
from Star Wars?

131
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,873
PAM: The end of the
world as we know it!

132
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:20,444
CHERYL/CAROL: Pam's like, gay
for doomsday, she thinks our

133
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,381
whole society's gonna collapse if
we run out of oil or whatever.

134
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:28,352
PAM: If?! You mean when!
Wow, and that is a perfect

135
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:31,055
example of a pre-post-peak-oil

136
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,022
mindset. The --

137
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:35,292
MALORY: Ahhh. Say, this stuff

138
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:37,394
is pretty good. What
did you say it was?

139
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,995
PAM: Basically pure ethanol?

140
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,831
MALORY: Huh. Well God
bless corn subsidies.

141
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:44,301
CHERYL/CAROL: Who're
you, Earl Butz?

142
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:46,403
MALORY: You say that
like it's a bad thing.

143
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:48,539
ARCHER (O.S.): Oh for the--
I said I was sorry!

144
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,906
CYRIL (O.S.): No you didn't!

145
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,641
ARCHER: Oh. Well I
was planning to.

146
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:53,043
GILLETTE: Oh, well
then no hard feelings.

147

ARCHER: Good, because your
shitty sarcasm notwithstanding,

148
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,315
I'm glad that's behind us so we
can enjoy what is probably a

149
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,984
once in a lifetime ad-
LANA: Rrrowrff!

150
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,519
ARCHER: -- venture, again?

151
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,854
Seriously? Why are
you puking so much?

152
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,856
LANA: Ugh, because
shut up and steer.

153
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,492
ARCHER: Here, take a
pull off this guy.

154
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,527
LANA: No! For the
like, ninth time, no!

155
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,464
ARCHER: Yes, c'mon, it'll take the edge off.
And I think I

156
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,232
speak for everybody-
CYRIL/GILLETTE: No you don't.

157
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:19,169
ARCHER: -- shut up, when I say we'd all
be a lot happier if you weren't so...

158
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,339
LANA: What, anxious?! About a
half-drunk first-time-driving-a-

159
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,842
submarine idiot taking me to the
bottom of the ocean to face

160
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:28,979
forty eco-terrorists led by a
crazy person who's about to

161
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,016
bomb the entire east
coast with nerve gas?!

162
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:36,853
ARCHER: I was gonna say-
LANA: What?! What were you gonna say?!

163
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:39,289
MURPHY: They're going to say
that I've gone insane, that

164
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:45,996
I've lost my mind. And that's fine, let them.
Because the real insanity is the

165
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,199
systematic, my God the almost
deliberate way, those bastards

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,401
are destroying our oceans.

167
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:55,705
And I hate that it's come to this, but
I truly don't see an alternative.

168
00:07:55,706 --> 00:08:00,611
So, you all know what you have to
do, and I know you won't fail me.

169
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:06,216
Nor I you, gentlemen...
nor I you.

170
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:14,069
ARCHER: I was gonna say "bitchy and
periody" but then I thought better of it.

171
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:21,406
ARCHER (O.S.): Okay, we're getting close.
Let's go over

172
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:22,674
the legends again. Lana?

173
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:26,678
LANA: I am tough-but-fair investigative
reporter Sojourner King.

174
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,347
ARCHER: Which, ugh, whatever.

175
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:29,547
Cyril?

176
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:31,884
CYRIL: [sigh) Chet, sound guy.

177
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,719
ARCHER: That's it? C'mon Chet,
the devil's in the details!

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,323
Like, I'm Randy Magnum, local
Emmy-winning cameraman and

179
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:40,492
nationally ranked
pro kitesurfer.

180
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:41,326
LANA: No you're not.

181
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,494
ARCHER: Well Randy Magnum is!

182
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,461
Ray, go.

183
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:47,065
GILLETTE: I am segment producer Carl Channing...
ARCHER: Oh my God, c'mon...

184
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,067
GILLETTE: And -- what's
Randy Magnum ranked?

185
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,002
ARCHER: Fourth.

186
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:52,137
GILLETTE: And third-ranked
pro kitesurfer.

187
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,705
ARCHER: What?! No you're not!

188
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:54,572
GILLETTE: Carl Channing is.

189
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,608
LANA: Nobody is a nationally
ranked anything! That is the

190
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:59,644
worst legend you could possibly
have, it would literally take

191
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:01,346
ten seconds to check it out!

192
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:02,814
ARCHER: Yeah, Carl.

193
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:05,417
LANA: Okay, shut
up, there it is.

194
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,921
CYRIL: Jeezy Petes,
that thing is huge!

195
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,755
MURPHY: Sealab to DSV, over?

196
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,824
LANA: This is-
ARCHER: This is DSV I'm skippering!

197
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:14,592
MURPHY: Um, okay. You
sound pretty excited.

198
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,895
ARCHER: I am, actually.
It's my first time.

199
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,530
MURPHY: Hey, super.

200
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,933
You're clear to dock, so
just head for the lights.

201
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,734
And I'll be waiting for you.

202
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,768
[zzrpt]

203
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,540
LANA: Was that -- did he sound -- do
you think this is some kind of trap?

204
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:34,212
ARCHER: What? No, I don't think it's a trap!
Although I never do...

205
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:35,914
And it very often is.

206
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:39,918
LANA: And that's how they died...
ARCHER: Right?

207
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,756
MALORY: A little peach juice, a little
of that old Kentucky Moon, and... boom.

208
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,925
You've almost got
yourself a Bellini.

209
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:47,459
CHERYL/CAROL: Mmmm!

210
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,194
PAM: Holy shitsnacks!

211
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,696
MALORY: Well it's no Harry's
Bar, but here you don't have

212
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:55,033
Hemingway grabbing
your tits every time you-[flrp]

213
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,635
PAM: Did I misread that?

214
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,704
MALORY: What do you think?

215
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,106
PAM: No?

216
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,108
MURPHY (O.S.): No, my men
are guarding the missiles.

217
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:04,476
CYRIL: Well there
goes that plan.

218
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,610
MURPHY: What plan?

219
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:10,282
LANA: To... do a one-on-one interview,
just you alone, with the missiles?

220
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,650
MURPHY: No, we're doing it on the
bridge, I've already got it all set up.

221
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,819
LANA: But I really think we
should do it wherever the

222
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,990
missiles are, to underscore
the gravity of the -

223
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,657
MURPHY: The bridge is
where the chair is.

224
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:22,094
LANA: But-
MURPHY: The bridge is where the chair is!

225
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,395
ARCHER: Yeah, Sojourner.

226
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,729
MURPHY: Thank you, uh...?

227
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,166
ARCHER: Randy, Randy Magnum,
I'm a local Emmy-winning

228
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,568
cameraman and nash -
LANA: Nooo!

229
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,338
ARCHER: -- shunally ranked pro
kitesurfer, second in the

230
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,410
nation, actually, which even the most
cursory internet search will corroborate.

231
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:39,277
LANA/CYRIL/GILLETTE: [sigh]

232
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:40,645
MURPHY: I really doubt
we'll have time, Randy.

233
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:44,082
MURPHY: We only have ten hours before
I'll be forced to launch my missiles.

234
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,784
LANA: Which are where
again, exactly?

235
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:47,852
MALORY (O.S.): You heard me!

236
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,787
I want fifty million dollars!

237
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:51,123
TIFFY: Pff, join the club.

238
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:51,789
CECIL: Right?

239
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,559
MALORY: That's how much I could've gotten
for the hydrogen bomb, so that's how

240
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,429
much I -- what do you
mean, join the club?

241
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,165
CECIL: Oh, that's just an idiom, it means-
MALORY: I know what it means,

242
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,934
you toboggan-wearing ass,
why did she say it?!

243
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:05,270
CECIL: Oh. I assume
because I'm penniless?

244
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:05,870
MALORY: What?!

245
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:08,040
CHERYL/CAROL: Ha, ha, oh.

246
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,207
Wait, what?

247
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,343
CECIL: (sighs) That's why I
tried to get control of your

248
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:14,712
inheritance. And I'm sorry
I did that, Beans. I just

249
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:18,483
wanted to help people, but all these
foundations are so expensive.

250
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:21,219
CHERYL/CAROL: I know, but Cecil!
You really spent your

251
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,155
whole inheritance on...
the poors?

252
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:25,857
CECIL: Well, and scientific research.
The Sealab alone cost

253
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:27,225
two hundred million.

254
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,661
MALORY: Wh-?! How did
it cost that much?!

255
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,796
CECIL: Well apparently they
bought a bunch of nerve gas

256
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:36,401
missiles, and hid that expense in the budget.
Which I never bothered to read.

257
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:37,735
Or even look at.

258
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:39,538
MURPHY: Look at this place!

259
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,141
Such a colossal boondoggle! We
don't do any research, really,

260
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:46,878
and building it, I mean, the
environmental impact was just insane!

261
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,013
LANA: So... why did
you take a job here?

262
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:51,916
MURPHY: To save the ocean! And
also my salary is six hundred

263
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,552
thousand dollars a year.

264
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:54,586
EVERYBODY: What!?

265
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,089
MURPHY: I know, but don't put that in there.
Let me just read

266
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,592
my list of demands. Ahem.
One, a fifty-year, worldwide

267
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:04,429
moratorium on all fishing. Two-
CYRIL: I'm sorry, did you mean whaling?

268
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,264
MURPHY: That's number
two, if you'll let me -

269
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,133
LANA: Wait, you want
to end all fishing?

270
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,434
ARCHER: For fifty years?!

271
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:12,170
MURPHY: At least. The
fish have to replenish.

272
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:15,373
LANA: Okay, that's it, I'm calling bullshit.
I want to see the missiles, now.

273
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:18,776
MURPHY: What, no, you can't, you-
LANA: You don't have any missiles!

274
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:21,513
MURPHY: Yes I do! I've got...
like fifty.

275
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:22,714
LANA: Fifty.

276
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,515
MURPHY: Ten?

277
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,382
ARCHER: That's still a lot.

278
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:29,687
LANA: Shut up. Captain Murphy, how long
have you been down here all alone?

279
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:32,457
MURPHY: (sigh) Two years.

280
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,527
Nobody had been paid in months,
the foundation was broke...

281
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,395
CYRIL: Not surprising,
given your salary.

282
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:41,633
MURPHY: Yeah, paid three years in advance.
He is the world's worst negotiator.

283
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,802
LANA: And you're, sorry, but
you've obviously had some kind

284
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,672
of psychotic break, so I think
you should come with us, and -

285
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:50,041
MURPHY: I'm not going anywhere!
Nor are you!

286
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,109
CYRIL/GILLETTE: Lanaaa!

287
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,110
LANA: Archerrrr!

288
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:53,211
ARCHER: Murpheeee!

289
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:57,115
I -- dammit, I had something
about point-and-shoot, but -

290
00:12:57,116 --> 00:13:00,051
MURPHY: A gun?! Are you insane, don't you
know how much pressure we're under?!

291
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:03,321
ARCHER: Honestly, and I don't know why
this is, but it never really gets to me.

292
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,957
CYRIL: Wait, I think he

LANA: Oh my God, Archer, I can't -- I
mean, I don't even know how to thank you!

442
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:17,599
ARCHER: Well, you could name

443
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,133
your kid after -
LANA: Noop.

444
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:22,704
ARCHER: Then just get me topside. I need
to brush Ray's tongue out of my mouth.

445
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:24,339
GILLETTE: I didn't give
you mouth to mouth!

446
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,978
ARCHER: C'mon, admit it, you Frenched me!
You can lie but your boner can't!

447
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,681
GILLETTE: (laughing)
Cut it out, Archer!

448
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,183
ARCHER: Yeah, look at ya!
All blushy!

449
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:40,054
LANA: Archer be careful, the defibrillator-
[BZZZZRPT!]

450
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,191
MALORY: So. Although Sealab was destroyed...
CECIL: It was insured for

451
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:46,093
three times its value, so
now I'm richer than ever.

452
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:50,365
CHERYL/CAROL: And I have forgiven you,
for being such an incorrigible douche.

453
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,599
MALORY: No one cares, because

454
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,967
most importantly -

455
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,001
ARCHER: I cheated not only

456
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:57,639
death, but also somehow
irreparable brain damage!

457
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,107
MALORY: That remains to be seen,
and shut up, because Lana

458
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,811
is going to be a mother!

459
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:06,047
CYRIL: Three cheers for
little Johnny Bastard!

460
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:08,049
PAM: Hip, hip!...Ahem.

461
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,116
Inappropriate.

462
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:14,055
MALORY: The point is -- and seriously,
shut up -- everybody has a happy ending!

463
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:16,891
GILLETTE: Really?! Ol' Ray
gets a happy ending?!

464
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,326
ARCHER: Ray-
GILLETTE: Or does Randy

465
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:19,994
Roughhouse here zap him with a

466
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:24,417
defibrillator and fry the CPU
that made his bionic legs work?!

467
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,946
ARCHER: Ray, I'm sorry! C'mon,
I was wrong!

468
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:27,848
GILLETTE: Really.

469
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:32,831
ARCHER: Yeah, without the mustache
you look, like, a billion percent gayer.

470
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,819
Boop.

471
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:45,247
