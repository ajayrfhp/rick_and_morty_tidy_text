MALORY: Swift and severe.

311
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:56,305
The punishment will
be swift and severe.

312
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:59,141
I mean it, Lana, that
girl is out of here.

313
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,979
LANA: Aww, and right when she was gonna
invest ten million dollars in ISIS.

314
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,180
MALORY: She said that?!

Oh my God, that phony
prospectus must've worked!

316

Do you think the
money's in here?!

Come on, help me
look in these boxes!

Oh.

Dammit.

322
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:20,096
ARCHER: So yeah... Krieger's helping
Barry finish his rocketship,

323
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:23,666
and when he gets home he can...
tell you about the other woman.

324
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:24,333
KATYA: The what?!

325
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,035
ARCHER: Wait, how'd we
get to another woman?

326
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,671
KATYA: Oh my God, do you
have proof of this?!

327
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:33,309
ARCHER: No, I -- can probably get some...
KATYA: Oh, Sterling!

328
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:37,647

ARCHER: And also if I prove it somehow...

329
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,382
KATYA: Then he will
be dead to me!

330
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:43,319
Because I will kill him
with my bare hands!

331
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:48,791
ARCHER: Yeah, or not, since then there's
no reason for him to come home at all!

332
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:49,559
KATYA: What's that?

333
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:50,860
ARCHER: Nothing, what?

334
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,029
Oh, you mean that?

CHERYL/CAROL: No.

ARCHER: I -- rrgh!

348
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:30,104
MALORY: A situation, by the way,
for which I blame you entirely.

349
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:31,939
LANA: How is this my fault?!

You were the -- holy shit, there really
are nerve gas canisters up here!

and just do it.

Forget about actually
fixing the rocket.

KRIEGER: But what about
the robot fight?!

358
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,590
And why are you
beating on shit?!

KRIEGER: Okay, either Barry!

I need you to find a female
co-ax bus connector.

will hurt, because I will rip it out!

Neil deGrasse Tyson!

467
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,213
HOLOGRAM: Oooooh,
deGrasse Tyson-san...

468
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,912
ARCHER: How the hell
did you fix his ship?!

469
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,356
I gave you a bunch of gibberish!

470
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,425
KRIEGER: I may have gone
a teeny bit off script?

Alaska or somewhere else snowy,
where he can't track us!

478
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,341
KRIEGER: Doesn't
even make sense.

479
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,543
ARCHER: You know what
doesn't make sense?!
