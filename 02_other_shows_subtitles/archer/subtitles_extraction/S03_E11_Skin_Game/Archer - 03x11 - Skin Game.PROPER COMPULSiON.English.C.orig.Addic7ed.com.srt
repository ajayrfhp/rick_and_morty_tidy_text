1
00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:02,885
Ugh, what is that?

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:04,787
I've never smelled
that smell in America.

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:07,157
I live in a
"transitional" neighborhood.

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,226
As the crack dealers
move to nicer ones?

5
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:10,428
This better be good, Krieger.

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,833
I mean hula girls, a replica volcano, some --
I have something better!

7
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,967
A surprise!

8
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:17,771
I hate surprises.

9
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,607
Except surprise fellatio.

10
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,642
That I like.

11
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,143
The non-Midnight Cowboy kind.

12
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:24,112
Yeah, no, you
can breathe easy.

13
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:25,680
Actually I can
barely breathe at all.

14
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:29,183
- Oh, probably the bathroom...
- Jesus, it's a --

15
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:30,184
A shared bath.

16
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:32,154
I was going to
say a literal shithole.

17
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,023
Krieger, how and why do you live here?

18
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:36,059
I use my salary
for "pet" projects.

19
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,194
Nope! Nope!

20
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:41,166
I had Korean barbecue for lunch, I
cannot look at a Dr. Moreau pig-baby.

21
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:42,668
Relax, you're gonna love this.

22
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,703
No I'm not, and
also I need to pee.

23
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:47,706
Don't be nervous,
I'm not gonna rape you.

24
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,974
Jesus Christ!

25
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,877
But you were gonna flay
me like a perch?!

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,578
Wh-?

27
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,946
No, that's a wetsuit!

28
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,114
Of human flesh?!

29
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:55,116
Neoprene!

30
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:56,183
I'm a certified diver.

31
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,485
Why's it skin-colored?

32
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,253
It's not if you're black.

33
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,955
What is it with
serial killers and skin?

34
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:03,191
I'm not a... serial killer.

35
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,693
Wait, why'd
you emphasize serial?

36
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:06,794
I didn't, what?

37
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:09,030
Are we doing, did I mention
I have a surprise for you?

38
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,233
Krieger!
Equal parts soju sangria and fear-induced

39
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,802
adrenaline means I have to pee.

40
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:16,572
And not in that sick bathroom, so--
O.K. There's a utility

41
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:17,473
sink in my lab.

42
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:18,642
Fine, wherever.

43
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:19,676
But no surprises.

44
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:20,344
Right.

45
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,745
Well. Except for the one.

46
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,683
Uh, is the surprise
that you're pirating cable?

47
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,454
No, no, Archer,
I've finally cracked it!

48
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,924
Wow, amazing, you can play YYZ.

49
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:35,462
First of all, it's Y-Y-Zed,
and second of all, no, I can't yet,

50
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:36,797
it's impossible.

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,070
Well --
And third of all, wrong thing!

52
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:42,205
Oh my God.

53
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,439
Krieger.

54
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,841
Is that...?

55
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,576
But how did...?

56
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:49,412
- I mean, at our wedding...
- I know.

57
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:52,049
- There was a lot of confusion...
- Noooooo!

58
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,117
Katyaaa!

59
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,155
No-ho-ho-hooooo!

60
00:01:57,157 --> 00:02:00,460
Gross and/or ick, and is she...?

61
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:01,294
Alive?

62
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:02,095
Yeah, man.

63
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,364
Flick her titty.

64
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,299
Katya!

65
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,300
You're alive!

66
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:08,269
Well, on, technically.

67
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,004
Either way, you're welcome.

68
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,606
My sweet, beautiful Katya!

69
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:12,340
It's you!

70
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:16,477
My darlink Sterlink, you awake
me like the prince of Snow White!

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,645
I love you!

72
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,214
I... I love you!

73
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:24,385
Krieger thank you, this is the --
why do you have an erection?!

74
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:26,888
I'm happy.

75
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:37,512

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

76
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,291
Here they are!

77
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,059
God, geese at the trough.

78
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:05,927
What?

79
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,530
Are you - thanks for
startiar my sentence for me -

80
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,232
people standing around for?

81
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,500
It's Bear Claw Monday.

82
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:14,236
And almost nine-thirty,
Pam, in case you were thinking

83
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:15,971
about, I dunno, working.

84
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:18,006
Jeez, somebody's raring to go.

85
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,875
Because I burn clean, Cyril.

86
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,378
Because I don't glop up my
engine with bear claws.

87
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,547
And also because --
Hello, friends of ISIS!

88
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:31,820
- And also because Katya needs a W--  
- Holy shitzombies!

89
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:32,620
I know, right?

90
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:33,655
Still crazy hot.

91
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,057
How --
Well for one thing, no bear claws.

92
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,592
is she even here?!

93
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,427
Wait, does this mean you and me --
Pam!

94
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,130
I swear to God, if you people
can't keep it down, this is the last

95
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,433
Bear Claw Mon --

96
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,734
Am I seeing things?!

97
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:49,971
- No, she's really here...
- Ow, ahh!

98
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:52,573
And if we don't file her
W-9 that first check will take,

99
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:53,841
like, eight weeks.

100
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,944
- I'm sorry, I'm a little confused...
- What, by the

101
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,412
dead woman standing here?!

102
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,747
Dressed like a whore?

103
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,883
Dead woman my
still-shapely ass.

104
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:07,254
She's obviously a double, carved up by
KGB plastic surgeons to look like Katya,

105
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,655
and --
How dare you?!

106
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:09,390
I'm sorry?

107
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,926
How dare you fail to recognize
my greatest accomplishment to date?!

108
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,962
You finally nailed YYZ?

109
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:15,929
It's zed!

110
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:18,365
And no, Neil Peart stands alone.

111
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,535
I was referring... to this!

112
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,436
Katya? On the flourish?

113
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:28,240
Is when --
Oh! Sorry, doktor...

114
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:30,609
Just like
the gypsy woman said!

115
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,211
You need to quit going to her.

116
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,179
And you need your head
examined if you think that

117
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:38,716
abomination is ever
going to work for ISIS!

118
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,018
Abomination?

119
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,019
Baby, come on,
you're not an abomination.

120
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:44,889
I mean, that's your
original skin, right?

121
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,190
Hobo.

122
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:46,890
What?

123
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:47,725
Yes.

124
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:48,359
See?

125
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,394
But --
Hang on, hang on.

126
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,495
Katya-person.

127
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:54,732
I'm still processing the
fact that you're a cyborg.

128
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,234
Yeah, way to bury the lead.

129
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:57,735
Who're you, Horace Greeley?

130
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,570
And also, was I not clear about that?

131
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:00,338
No!

132
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,808
- Although she does feel a bit clammy...
- Ow! Stop it!

133
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,709
You stop it!

134
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,445
Just because she's a cyborg
doesn't mean you can feel her up!

135
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,782
Da, I hef feelinks
just like all of you.

136
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:14,453
- I feel love, I leff, I sometimes cry...
- Albeit a

137
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:15,821
saline-lubricant solution.

138
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:19,559
Which reminds me, we need to talk about
other, um, internal lubricants like --

139
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,326
Stop!

140
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:21,695
That sounds like a private matter.

141
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,064
Yeah, that's what I'm talking ab--
And Katya!

142
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:24,965
My lovely lady.

143
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:28,001
Needs to go with Pam now
to do her stupid W-9.

144
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,637
But Ms. Archer said--
What, Pam?!

145
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,673
That she's so jealous of my love for
Katya, she won't hire a world-class spy

146
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:37,911
who also, spoiler alert, can do this?!

147
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,646
Babe, you wanna...?

148
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:44,084
- Oh! Sorry, darlink...
- Hey!

149
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,053
Wait, or do I mean sploosh?

150
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,955
Ya know, it's probably not the
worst idea in the world to have...

151
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:53,026
someone like her working at ISIS, since--
Since you wanna

152
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:53,861
screw affirmative action?

153
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,497
Since the KGB has
someone like Barry!

154
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:57,565
Barry!

155
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,835
Thet, thet --
Don't worry about Barry.

156
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,004
I'm never gonna let him
hurt you again, baby.

157
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:03,638
Ha!

158
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,006
It is Barry who should worry!

159
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,042
If I ever see thet <i>zloi
mudak again, I --</i>

160
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:08,843
<i>Don't worry, you won't!</i>

161
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:11,112
<i>Yeah he never
calls, he never writes...</i>

162
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:13,347
<i>So just go with Pam
to do your paperwork --</i>

163
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,983
<i>And I'll go try
to convince Malory</i>

164
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:17,384
<i>that you'll be an asset to ISIS.</i>

165
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:20,420
<i>Thank you Lana, that's --
So not doing it for you.</i>

166
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,322
<i>So don't care.</i>

167
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:23,791
<i>So! Robocop!</i>

168
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:24,792
<i>Pro or con?</i>

169
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:25,626
<i>Neither!</i>

170
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,629
<i>I don't want her to be an ISIS agent,</i>

171
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:30,599
<i>and I certainly don't want her
and Sterling back together!</i>

172
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,568
<i>Well, I can
understand the latter --</i>

173
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,337
<i>I mean, who wears bangs?</i>

174
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,339
<i>-- but it can't hurt to
level the playing field,</i>

175
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,475
<i>now that --
Nikolai has been murdered.</i>

176
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:42,279
<i>By the new head of the KGB,
who is also a cyborg.</i>

177
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,215
<i>Just like
the gypsy woman said!</i>

178
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,049
<i>Oh for --!</i>

179
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,284
<i>- Oh, alright...
- Really?!</i>

180
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:48,819
<i>Katya can be an ISIS agent?!</i>

181
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:49,887
<i>Probationary.</i>

182
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,691
<i>But if I find out the KGB is behind this --
You won't!</i>

183
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:54,392
<i>They're not!</i>

184
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,028
<i>I'll part her out
and sell her for scrap.</i>

185
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,663
<i>And I thought you were
scared of robots!</i>

186
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,532
<i>I -- no, not
Katya, she's different!</i>

187
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:02,467
<i>Hmp.</i>

188
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,969
<i>Well don't come crying to me when
she breaks your heart again.</i>

189
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,105
<i>She didn't break my heart,
Mother, she was murdered.</i>

190
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,475
<i>Yes, and then you ran
away from home to, ugh,</i>

191
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:13,044
<i>grief-bang the entire Pacific Rim.</i>

192
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:13,845
<i>To what?</i>

193
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:14,512
<i>Nothing!</i>

194
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,881
<i>Oh please, I bet the
gene pool of Polynesia</i>

195
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,683
<i>is irreparably altered.</i>

196
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,584
<i>Darlink...?</i>

197
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,586
<i>Baby, I was
emotionally shattered.</i>

198
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,656
<i>Which, turns out, to be
kind of a pantydropper.</i>

199
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:26,091
<i>Is alright, darlink.</i>

200
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:29,027
<i>I understand this... how do you say?</i>

201
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,262
<i>Griff-bakink.</i>

202
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:30,896
<i>See?</i>

203
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,697
<i>Is she not something special?</i>

204
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,233
<i>Oh, is special occasion?</i>

205
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,835
<i>Well, the love of my
life, this smoking-hot woman,</i>

206
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,105
<i>was not only murdered and
then brought back to life,</i>

207
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:42,576
<i>she also just got a job today,
so yeah, pretty special.</i>

208
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,177
<i>- Uh...
- Shut up.</i>

209
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,412
<i>Babe? What're you hungry for?</i>

210
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,681
<i>I am thinking.</i>

211
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,750
<i>While she thinks, bring
me some soup dumplings.</i>

212
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,853
<i>No, no, I am thinking
about your mother.</i>

213
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:53,789
<i>God, don't waste the
ROM, or RAM, whatever.</i>

214
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,924
<i>Does she hate what I am?</i>

215
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,660
<i>What you are, meaning
"the one woman who can</i>

216
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:59,263
<i>free her child from the
psychological prison she's spent</i>

217
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:00,698
<i>a lifetime erecting?"</i>

218
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,835
<i>No, darlink, meaning a...
cyborg.</i>

219
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:05,403
<i>She'd hate you
no matter what you are.</i>

220
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:07,438
<i>Because I did not
ask to be this way...</i>

221
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,141
<i>Yeah, hey, me
either, vis a vis Mother.</i>

222
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,709
<i>And you?</i>

223
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,043
<i>Do you think I am a monster?</i>

224
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:16,347
<i>Baby, I don't care about
the chips and gears and...</i>

225
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,615
<i>I assume some hinges?</i>

226
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:21,485
<i>All I care about is what I see
when I look into those big green--</i>

227
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,921
<i>oh, I guess they're red now, huh?</i>

228
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:24,989
<i>Anyway, your eyes.</i>

229
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,390
<i>Da?</i>

230
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:28,593
<i>And what do you see in my eyes?</i>

231
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,329
<i>Mostly those insane boobs.</i>

232
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,397
<i>Check!</i>

233
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,432
<i>Ah.</i>

234
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,834
<i>Ooh.</i>

235
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,935
<i>Eee.</i>

236
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:37,369
<i>Unn.</i>

237
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,237
<i>Ahhhh.</i>

238
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:38,904
<i>Darlink?</i>

239
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:39,939
<i>Are you alright?</i>

240
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,574
<i>Yes, no, yes.</i>

241
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:42,675
<i>Yes.</i>

242
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:46,312
<i>Lot of feelings coming together,
just trying to process.</i>

243
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:48,448
<i>Not gonna lie, having
some dj vu here.</i>

244
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:54,054
<i>Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... ow!</i>

245
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,389
<i>Owwww!</i>

246
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,558
<i>Which, if I gave
it any real thought,</i>

247
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,193
<i>would probably explain a lot.</i>

248
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,728
<i>Try to relex, darlink.</i>

249
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,864
<i>You are, how do you say?</i>

250
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:03,932
<i>To push a rope?</i>

251
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:06,368
<i>Sorry, babe, I'll focus.</i>

252
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,147
<i>But could you close your eyes?</i>

253
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:11,307
<i>I kinda feel like I'm banging
tail-lights on a country road.</i>

254
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,438
<i>I swear to God, if I
went blind right this very</i>

255
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,073
<i>second I'd be okay with that.</i>

256
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,741
<i>Oh, dun't say that!</i>

257
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,143
<i>Mr. Sleepy Head!</i>

258
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:22,977
<i>Sleep?</i>

259
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,446
<i>I've been doing yogic breathing
work for two hours.</i>

260
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,047
<i>My balls are like cran-baisins.</i>

261
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:27,814
<i>What?</i>

262
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:28,882
<i>Cranberry raisins?</i>

263
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:29,916
<i>Craisins?</i>

264
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,986
<i>Whatever, yes, I
call them cran-baisins.</i>

265
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:34,188
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

266
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,056
<i>I em amazink!</i>

267
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,558
<i>Don't take this
the wrong way, but duh.</i>

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,927
<i>I mean our love, darlink.</i>

269
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,663
<i>It feels like...
what is a giant, unstoppable wave?</i>

270
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,332
<i>Wait, you know craisins,
but you don't know tsunami?</i>

271
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,968
<i>Da, then our
love is like tsunami.</i>

272
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,372
<i>Or the Mountain Everest.</i>

273
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:55,872
<i>An apt metaphor.</i>

274
00:09:55,874 --> 00:10:01,044
<i>Because not only am I lightheaded,
certain parts of me are --</i>

275
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:04,548
<i>Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb!</i>

276
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,753
- <i>They are not coming back.
- Why?</i>

277
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,021
<i>In the sink?</i>

278
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,790
<i>Is your... vagina?!</i>

279
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:12,691
<i>Why?</i>

280
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,193
<i>Darlink, it was dirty.</i>

281
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,863
<i>The remedy for which,
miss, if you'll forgive</i>

282
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:17,931
<i>my boldness...?</i>

283
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,967
<i>Da, please, Woodhouse,
I think boldness is needed.</i>

284
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:21,901
<i>What do you suggest?</i>

285
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:25,071
<i>White vinegar,
mineral oil, and elbow grease.</i>

286
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:28,808
<i>Same thing we used in the RFC
to clean the engines on our</i>

287
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,410
<i>Sopwith Camels.</i>

288
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:34,713
<i>And so, with your permission,
while you breakfast on the</i>

289
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:39,818
<i>terrace I'll get that little
pleasure boat looking Bristol!</i>

290
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,188
<i>I took the liberty of
poaching you an egg.</i>

291
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,524
<i>Is not much of a liberty,
considerink thet you are going</i>

292
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,892
<i>to polish my vagina.</i>

293
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,327
<i>No.</i>

294
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,129
<i>No it isn't.</i>

295
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:54,033
<i>And when he woke
up from faint, boom!</i>

296
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,501
<i>He ren out of there fest like crezzy.</i>

297
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:57,402
<i>So.</i>

298
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:58,403
<i>You dated him.</i>

299
00:10:58,405 --> 00:10:59,371
<i>What do you think?</i>

300
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,940
<i>I think... hang on.</i>

301
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:06,843
<i>I think if you're looking for
insight into why Archer is...</i>

302
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,613
<i>Archer, you need to jump in a
time machine and then go have</i>

303
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,782
<i>a treesome with Oedipus
and Sigmund Freud.</i>

304
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,384
<i>Thanks for nothing.</i>

305
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,118
<i>Well?!</i>

306
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,320
<i>I don't really have a roadmap
for my ex finding your</i>

307
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:18,222
<i>robo-gina in the sink.</i>

308
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,690
<i>In the sink, Cyril!</i>

309
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:20,858
<i>In the sink!</i>

310
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,661
<i>It was like a
transistor radio and a</i>

311
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,530
<i>veal cutlet had a baby!</i>

312
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:27,299
<i>Well gross and/or ick--
Right?!</i>

313
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,102

316
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,274
<i>and she made me pour out all
the booze at my house!</i>

317
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,576
<i>Holy shit, really?</i>

318
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,511
<i>Glengoolie Blue?</i>

319
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,780
<i>Yeah, and it's three
hundred a bottle...</i>

320
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,983
<i>I -- which I haven't even tasted yet!</i>

321
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:45,453
<i>Because I was saving it
for a special occasion!</i>

322
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,123
<i>Befitting a gift from my grandfather!</i>

323
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,458
<i>Who's dead!</i>

324
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,527
<i>Of course he is,
he'd be like, a hundred.</i>

325
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:53,795
<i>It's almost empty!</i>

326
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,630
<i>Just like my heart, Cyril --</i>

327
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,231
<i>Well, not your liver...
-- because she ripped</i>

328
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,065
<i>it out!</i>

329
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,066
<i>Wait, your liver?</i>

330
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,001
<i>My heart!</i>

331
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:01,702
<i>And threw it in the sink!</i>

332
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,004
<i>Wait, her vagina?</i>

333
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,605
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

334
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,708
<i>- Oh for --</i>-

335
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,743
<i>The old man knew his scotch.</i>

336
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,912
<i>You are such an... asshole!</i>

337
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:14,748
<i>Wait, really?</i>

338
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,949
<i>Yes, really!</i>

339
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,151
<i>That was a gift to my grandfather!</i>

340
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,285
<i>From Frank!</i>

341
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,420
<i>Sinatra!</i>

342
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,088
<i>Well then I feel even worse,</i>

343
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,291
<i>because I'm probably gonna
puke it up in about five --</i>

344
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,726
<i>One minutes.</i>

345
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,194
<i>But I meant about Katya.</i>

346
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,632
<i>Yes!
You are an asshole about all things!</i>

347
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:33,368
<i>But, specifically,
now, about Katya.</i>

348
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,837
<i>Or...
could I hef done something wrung?</i>

349
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,672
<i>Besides leavin yer
cooch in the sink?</i>

350
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,506
Pam! Pam!</i>

351
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,107
<i>What?</i>

352
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:40,375
<i>That just sounds considerate.</i>

353
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:44,245
<i>Is just, I know he hez
wery good reason to hate...</i>

354
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,714
<i>people like me.</i>

355
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,316
<i>Who, whores?</i>

356
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:50,486
<i>And that's twice, sorry,
ignore me, my whole thing is</i>

357
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:51,754
<i>I just crave attention.</i>

358
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:55,124
<i>But I mean, Barry
did murder her -- ungh!</i>

359
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:58,427
<i>And my possible father -- ungh!</i>

360
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,262
<i>And more importantly,
tried to murder me!</i>

361
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:01,096
<i>Unngh!</i>

362
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:01,864
<i>Because Barry!</i>

363
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,132
<i>Is a psychopath!</i>

364
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:06,002
<i>That doesn't mean all
cyborgs are like that!</i>

365
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:09,506
<i>But Cyril, machines...
can hurt people.</i>

366
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,975
<i>Waaaaaaghhhh!</i>

367
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:15,780
<i>Well you lost me there,
thankfully, but -- Give me that!</i>

368
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,582
<i>What, was that Peter Lawford's?</i>

369
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:20,752
<i>No, it was -- Oh shut up,
do you wanna learn something?</i>

370
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:23,021
<i>- Probably not...
- Because did you</i>

371
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,723
<i>know that in Chinese, the
words for crisis and</i>

372
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,491
<i>opportunity are the sathme word?</i>

373
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,361
<i>And... point?</i>

374
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,363
<i>Hello?!</i>

375
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:31,431
<i>Actually I have no idea.</i>

376
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,899
<i>They just used to say
that in the hospital.</i>

377
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:37,870
<i>While they made us fold those
pointy goddamn paper birds.</i>

378
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:40,306
<i>I think what Cheryl's--
Bawk bawk!</i>

379
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:41,007
<i>Therapy cranes!</i>

380
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:41,741
<i>Bawk!</i>

381
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:44,277
<i>I think what she's trying
to say is you can either think</i>

382
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,381
<i>- of this as a crisis...
- Or an opportunity!</i>

383
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:48,816
<i>To get closer!</i>

384
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:52,120
<i>- Hooray...
- By marrying her?!</i>

385
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,389
<i>That actually
was Peter Lawford's.</i>

386
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,759
<i>And why not, you were
gonna marry her before!</i>

387
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:58,460
<i>Before she wasn't a cyborg.</i>

388
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,630
<i>She's still kind,
smart, insanely hot...</i>

389
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,765
<i>Yeah, and even
though it's detachable,</i>

390
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,034
<i>that vagina is like, mind-shattering.</i>

391
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:07,701
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

392
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:12,673
<i>What, does it vibrate, or -- Ow!
Ow! Dammit You started it!</i>

393
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,775
<i>That's my fiance
you're talking about!</i>

394
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,709
<i>Really?</i>

395
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,711
<i>I can look past
our differences, Cyril,</i>

396
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:19,246
<i>I'm a much bigger man than you think.</i>

397
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,548
<i>Plus it'll drive Mother crazy.</i>

398
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,818
<i>Plus yes, it vibrates.</i>

399
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,819
<i>Really?!</i>

400
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,721
<i>Yes, really, and... Krieger?</i>

401
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:28,589
<i>Today?</i>

402
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,189
<i>Hm?</i>

403
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:29,957
<i>Oh! Sorry.</i>

404
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,659
<i>Little thing
called timing, Krieger.</i>

405
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,694
<i>And the erection's
really not appropriate.</i>

406
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,396
<i>I'm still happy!</i>

407
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,463
<i>Katya?</i>

408
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:37,431
<i>Baby?</i>

409
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:41,768
<i>Oh yes, yes, a
thousand times yes!</i>

410
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,670
<i>When's the wedding,
when's the wedding?!</i>

411
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,404
<i>I can actually
marry y'all right here.</i>

412
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,772
<i>Oh for God's sake!</i>

413
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,542
<i>Get it over with!</i>

414
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,409
<i>Brett!</i>

415
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,510
<i>Aaagh!</i>

416
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,078
<i>Wait, do you want me to be a groomsman?</i>

417
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,679
<i>No!</i>

418
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,347
<i>Go to the liquor store
and buy a case of --</i>

419
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,482
<i>three cases of champagne!</i>

420
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,484
<i>Sure, I'll just
limp on down there.</i>

421
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:59,551
<i>Don't limp, Brett!</i>

422
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:00,119
<i>Run!</i>

423
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:03,590
<i>We're having a wedding
in a few short minutes!</i>

424
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,091
<i>And it's a win-win.</i>

425
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:07,394
<i>Plus it vibrates.</i>

426
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,073
Okay, bride and groom, check.

427
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,709
Bridesmaids, check.

428
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:15,944
Best man --
Well, best available.

429
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:18,881
Oh for -- name one,
name one friend of yours.

430
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:19,749
Shut up.

431
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,385
Ray, don't you have like,
a priest outfit, or...?

432
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,488
No, I wore it to Fetish Night
at The Snug, and it's covered in --

433
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,523
Okay! Ugh.

434
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,957
Red wine, ass.

435
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,427
And who gives this woman to
be wed in holy matrimony?

436
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,262
I do!

437
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,498
And no mother of the groom, so --
Yes! Right here!

438
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,133
Mother! You came!

439
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,667
Phrasing, boom!

440
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:39,602
Ahem.

441
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,803
Inappropriate.

442
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:41,570
Alrighty!

443
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,873
So unless anyone - besides Mommie
Dearest - objects to this union --

444
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,842
Uh, I think other Barry might.

445
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:47,743
Wh-?

446
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:48,710
Barry?!

447
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,013
Yeah, and I brought bubbly!

448
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,181
You.. <i>. Mudak!</i>

449
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:53,915
<i>Whoa!</i>

450
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,017
<i>You kiss your mother-board
with that mouth?</i>

451
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,920
<i>And also, is anybody
gonna ask how and why</i>

452
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:01,122
<i>I knew to show up here?</i>

453
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,691
<i>Is...?</i>

454
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,691
<i>Okay, I'll bite.</i>

455
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,428
<i>By tracking the satellite
signal from Katya's internal</i>

456
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,565
<i>hard drive, which Doctor Dipshit
over there, bought from the KGB!</i>

457
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,199
<i>Wh-?!</i>

458
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,033
<i>Krieger!</i>

459
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,201
<i>- Yeah, but the savings...
- Like,</i>

460
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:15,236
<i>eighty bucks you saved.</i>

461
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:18,005
<i>But nobody's gonna save you, Archer.</i>

462
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,907
<i>Don't you have
that backwards?!</i>

463
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:20,874
<i>Archer don't!</i>

464
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:24,845
<i>Everybody down.</i>

465
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,915
<i>Why do I always
forget you're -- ungh!</i>

466
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,517
<i>Darlink!</i>

467
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,886
<i>- Really super-strong...
- Yeah,</i>

468
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:34,055
<i>walk that off while I kill
your girlfriend again.</i>

469
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,190
<i>Then we do the dance.</i>

470
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,560
<i>Actually, I don't think
I'm in any shape to dance,</i>

471
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:38,260
<i>right now Barry.</i>

472
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:40,162
<i>The dance of death, idiot.</i>

473
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,498
<i>But first let's me and you cut a rug.</i>

474
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,168
<i>How you say... come et me, bro.</i>

475
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,471
<i>Rrrrrraaarrrrgh!</i>

476
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,339
<i>Ow.</i>

477
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:51,673
<i>Is thet the best you got?</i>

478
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,475
<i>Ungh!</i>

479
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,044
<i>Obviously not.</i>

480
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,112
<i>But this is -- oof!</i>

481
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:07,621
<i>Katyaaa!</i>

482
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,356
<i>Jesus somebody, a little help?!</i>

483
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:10,457
<i>We are if you'd shut up!</i>

484
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,524
<i>It's pound!</i>

485
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:12,359
<i>That is pound!</i>

486
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:17,630
<i>Pound six, pound five two!</i>

487
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:20,667
<i>I'm confused, what're we --
Here!</i>

488
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:21,635
<i>Still confused.</i>

489
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:25,005
<i>Ray, now!</i>

490
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:25,806
<i>Oh.</i>

491
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,108
<i>Their CPU's are powered
by photovoltaic cells!</i>

492
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,978
<i>Without exposure to a light-source
they'll slowly lose power!</i>

493
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,879
<i>Like vampires?</i>

494
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:35,648
<i>I -- no, nothing
like vampires, idiot!</i>

495
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,452
<i>Well I'm sorry, Ira Flatow!
From Newton's Apple.</i>

496
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:41,353
<i>Will you shut up?!</i>

497
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,722
<i>If Barry gets weak enough,
maybe you can overpower him!</i>

498
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:45,257
<i>I was just gonna say that!</i>

499
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,025
<i>Move!</i>

500
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:47,093
<i>Sterling, be careful!</i>

501
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:49,963
<i>Shut up.</i>

502
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:50,797
<i>Pam!</i>

503
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,168
<i>- It'll spoil...
- God damn it.</i>

504
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,670
<i>Barryyyyy!</i>

505
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:56,571
<i>Polo!</i>

506
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:59,908
<i>Will you shut up?!</i>

507
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,109
<i>Polo.</i>

508
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:05,547
<i>Beset, on all
sides, by idiots...</i>

509
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:12,988
<i>Brett?!</i>

510
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,056
<i>I thought you were dead!</i>

511
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:17,692
<i>No, just hurt
really really badly.</i>

512
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,929
<i>Although not nearly as
badly as I am now.</i>

513
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:23,231
<i>You better not be
bleeding on my carpet!</i>

514
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:26,100
<i>No, pretty sure
I'm all out of blood.</i>

515
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:31,239
<i>Well serves you
right, for -- Oh Barry,</i>

516
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,742
<i>- I am coming for you...
- Phrasing, boom.</i>

517
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,543
<i>Brett!</i>

518
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,745
<i>Polo!</i>

519
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,749
<i>And after I kill you, and
defile your cyborg-y corpse,</i>

520
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,651
<i>I'm gonna -- wh-?!</i>

521
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,652
<i>Oh for shit's sake!</i>

522
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:45,487
<i>Really?!</i>

523
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,422
<i>Woooooo!</i>

524
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,857
<i>Darlink, I ken explen!</i>

525
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,292
<i>Ray, turn the lights on!</i>

526
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,894
<i>Archer no, the photovoltaics!</i>

527
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,595
<i>Turn on the goddamn lights!</i>

528
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:55,664
<i>Gaaaagh!</i>

529
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>Why do I always forget that?!</i>

530
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,236
<i>And how can you explain that?!</i>

531
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:01,671
<i>What were they, having sex?!</i>

532
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,738
<i>Think so, yeah.</i>

533
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,907
<i>Called it!</i>

534
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,944
<i>As we fought, it became
more like, like dancing.</i>

535
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,546
<i>Bone dancing!</i>

536
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,546
<i>Shut up!</i>

537
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:13,315
<i>Katya, how could you do this?</i>

538
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:17,485
<i>I'm sorry I hurt you, but
I realized thet even though</i>

539
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,721
<i>you tried to see past what I
em, Barry and I are the same.</i>

540
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,524
<i>Inside and out.</i>

541
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,593
<i>Except her insides vibrate.</i>

542
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,827
<i>Rrrragh!</i>

543
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:27,849
<i>Ka-</i>

544
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,467
Always with the forgetting...

545
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,063
We are like two mermaids.

546
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,571
We will swim together.

547
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,953
So, I won't ask you to forgive me...

548
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,995
But could you at least be happy for me?

549
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:39,341
Because I have finally found a soulmate.

550
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,416
No.

551
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,512
Or whatever...

552
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,958
Yes. Yes.

553
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:47,378
Thank you, darling.

554
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,300
You will always have
a special place in my...

555
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:53,280
Well, I guess my C-drive.

556
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,482
Well, other Barry and I...

557
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:58,582
are in her other special place.

558
00:19:58,702 --> 00:19:59,825
Which, again,

559
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,326
vibrates.

560
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,529
Later, tator.

561
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,593
Well, mother, go ahead and say it.

562
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:10,033
Oh, Sterling.
You just had your heart broken.

563
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,734
And you don't need a smug

564
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:13,564
"I told you so" from me.

565
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:17,574
And smug it would be, because tell you
I most certainly did.

566
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,517
Just like that Electrolux all over again.

567
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:24,913
So...

568
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,834
- I know that sucked...
- Vacuum cleaner ponds?

569
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:28,742
Now?

570
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:29,661
Really?

571
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,171
No idea thankfully about any of that,
but

572
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,903
if you really did love Katya

573
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,319
you gotta be happy that she's happy.

574
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:38,088
Yeah...

575
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,830
She did look pretty happy, huh?

576
00:20:57,338 --> 00:21:06,411
