[Archer yawns, groans]

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,911
[Cyril] Archer, hey,
I'm glad you're here.

3
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:07,447
- I'm sure you are.
- Because I could kind of use your help.

4
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:10,249
I'm sure you could. But unless
it's helping you leave me alone

5
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:12,252
until I finish my
breakfast burrito, I...

6
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,488
- It's actually about your mother.
- Oh. Is she in this burrito?

7
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,757
- No, but...
- Then sorry. My hands are tied.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,525
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

9
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:21,994
Cyril, if you were me, I'd
drink a bunch of antifreeze

10
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,363
and then jump off a
bridge, holding a giant toaster.

[whirring, beeping]

00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,635
Oh, not you, buddy. Not...

13
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,104
you!

14
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:32,939
In the well-toned flesh.

15
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:35,609
Aaahh! [grunts]

16
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,345
On second thought, I
will have a glass of that.

17
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:41,148
Oh, good. I do hate to drink alone.

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,150
[clears throat] I'm here.

19
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:47,620
Well, but this is a
Grande Cuvée, so... [chuckles]

20
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:48,954
Cheers!

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,457
And here's to a lucrative reunion.

22
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,192
[Archer] And here's to what the shit?

23
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:56,396
Why is Slater here? Why are
you drinking champagne with him?

24
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,665
And may I please have
some of said champagne?

25
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:02,802
In reverse order, no, I was
mildly thirsty, and he wants to hire us.

26
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,570
To do what, kill another scientist?

27
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:06,006
And whose fault was that?

28
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,974
- I don't remember.
- Well...

29
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,727
But whatever CIA bullshit you want

30
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:11,545
us to do, Slater, the answer is no.

31
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,714
- Well, let's at least hear him out.
- [laughs]

32
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:17,016
- Are you literally insane?
- No, but I'll tell you what is,

33
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,218
A.J.'s tuition for
Country Day preschool.

34
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,920
Wait. I thought she
was banned from there.

35
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:24,690
She was, until we
made a sizable donation

36
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:27,326
- to their endowment fund.
- Wh... How sizable?

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,528
Uhh, we should probably hear him out.

38
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,864
- Goddamn it. What?
- Okay.

39
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,101
I assume you're all familiar
with The Manchurian Candidate?

40
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:36,403
- The Frank Sinatra movie?
- Oh, my God.

41
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,026
How the hell does this have anything to

42
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,538
do with a movie about three sailors,

43
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,188
Gabey, Chip and Ozzie, who fall

44
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,909
in love with three crazy gals,

45
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,057
Ivy, Hildy and Claire, during a

46
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,446
24-hour shore leave in New York?

47
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,182
Oh, and it's a musical?

48
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,783
That's On the Town!

49
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:54,054
And also Bea Benaderet's film debut.

50
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,756
Jethro's mom? Uh, Tweety's Granny?

51
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,557
- You done?
- Yes.

52
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,193
- Okay, so...
- Kate Bradley?

53
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,762
- [sighs]
- Mrs. Barney Rubble?

54
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:04,396
- Thanks for the champagne.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait!

55
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,399
He won't say another word.

56
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,902
- Please, don't go.
- [sighs] All right.

57
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:13,105
But only because my other
options are somehow even worse.

58
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,108
So, what do you want us to do?

59
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,276
Short answer, prevent World War III.

60
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,746
And longer answer... Where's the, uh...

61
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:21,313
Oh. Sorry.

62
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,217
Help me prevent a former CIA agent,

63
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,319
Ken Hinkins, who was brainwashed
in the MK-ULTRA program,

64
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,756
from assassinating a
visiting Soviet dignitary,

65
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:31,991
thus triggering a chain
of geopolitical events

66
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,060
that would lead to World War III.

67
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:36,262
So, questions? Comments?

68
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:40,133
That aren't about Bea Benaderet?

the CIA sucks at everything,

72
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,683
but can they really
not find this Hinkins guy?

73
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,853
- Why'd you come to us?
- Well, for one thing, I saw this.

74
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:34,854
- Goddamn it! Give me that!
- And obviously,

75
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:38,224
the agency could find him,
ass, but this is off the books.

within the borders of the
United States is illegal.

Especially Project MK-ULTRA!

00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,169
Wait. MK-ULTRA...

81
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:52,038
That was the CIA's mind-control
program, right?

82
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,198
Yeah, it's since
been, uh, discredited, but...

[laughs]

84
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,043
- Discredited for being batshit-crazy!
- It wasn't...

85
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:01,081
And for being in direct
violation of the Nuremberg Code,

86
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,821
which was written because of medical

work for the C-I-goddamn-A!

Wait, what?

91
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,159
Look, the Soviets were
kicking our ass in the Cold War.

92
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,161
Our scientists had to
think outside the box.

93
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,164
Oh, is that the box where
they kept informed consent?

94
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,399
Because I'm pretty sure that
all those mental patients

95
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:23,168
the CIA force-fed LSD didn't give it!

96

- Wait, what?
- Mental patients, Lana.

97
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,042
They gave them LSD every
day for six months.

98
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:31,343
Not six months. The longest one was only

99
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,780
- a hundred and seventy-four days.
- That is six months.

100
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:36,682
Oh, and what about Project
Artichoke, before Ultra,

where you dick-bags got
innocent people addicted to morphine?

Look, all that crazy drug stuff was

00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,255
intentionally "secretly" leaked

104
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:44,667
to divert attention from the

105
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,293
real goal of Project MK-ULTRA,

106
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,561
which was mind control through
hypnosis and torture.

107
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,230
Is that supposed to make it better?

108

No, but for real, though, the CIA

112
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,805
really drugged and hypnotized people?

113
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,124
Oh, please! That's merely the tip

114
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,610
of a very dark and twisted iceberg.

without even consulting
me, the owner of the agency...

120
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,792
to work for the CIA again?

121
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,293
Because my pool needs to be retiled.

you can't zap somebody's

- No, none of that. Just pure hypnosis.

00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,709
Ugh! Are you?

159
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:44,377
[Slater] Man, Veronica Deane.

160
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,579
- Remember her in Shanghai Moon?
- Oh, my God.

161
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:47,881
- That dress?
- Right?

162
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:49,481
Yeah. Tell him how you kissed her.

163
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,584
- What?
- First of all, she kissed me.

164
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:54,153
- My ass!
- My mouth. Wait.

165
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:56,423
I mean... And I
thought we were over that.

166
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,223
Well, apparently you're not.

167
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:00,427
I didn't cast her in Deadly Velvet.

168
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,129
Which, do you think they're currently

169
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,930
in principal photography on that, or...

170
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,043
I think it's neither the time nor the

171
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,068
place nor the Slater to discuss it!

172
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,668
I'm not the one who brought it up!

173
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,504
- You are exactly the one!
- First of all...

174
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:15,340
Could you both please shut up
and do what I hired you to do?

175
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,444
Which, if you already
knew Hinkins was here...

176
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,902
He's not. But there's somebody up

177
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,412
there who should know where he is.

178
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,615
- Yeah, Lana. Ow!
- [sighs]

179
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:26,019
Archer, your
professionalism never ceases to amaze me.

180
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,021
[gasps] You know what's amazing?

181
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:32,158
Magnets! Especially for
dumb idiots like you.

182
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,142
[Archer] Okay, what's this guy's name?

183
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,111
Eckerd. But follow my lead in there.

184
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,647
We gotta take it real easy. These
ex-ULTRA guys are really jumpy, so...

185
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,784
Hey, Eckerd, come move your
goddamn car outta my spot,

186
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,319
- you bug-eyed son of a...
- [rifle fires]

187
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,421
- Hey!
- Now who's the idiot?

188
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,822
- [rifle fires]
- Whoo!

189
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,423
He asked, idiotly.

190
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,992
Wait, wait, wait!

191
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:57,594
- [thudding, glass shatters]
- Damn it!

192
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:00,129
Holy shit!

193
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:01,964
- [grunting]
- Stop it!

194
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,399
- [Slater] Eckerd!
- [gasps] Slater!

195
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,134
It's okay. We just wanna talk.

196
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,504
Yeah, the gun's just
a conversation piece.

197
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,339
[Pam] What? Bluntz & Blintzen?

198
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,076
Nice try, Krieger. Who
am I, the Road Runner?

199
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,311
Although if this is for
real, I'll never forgive myself.

200
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:19,115
Goddamn it, this better not be a ruse!

201
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,851
All right. There better be some damn...

202
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,753
[sputters, spits] What the...

203
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,655
[heart beating]

204
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:27,856
Huh.

205
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,025
- Pamela.
- Yes, Doctor.

206
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,428
You are under my complete control.

207
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,532
- Yes, Doctor.
- Tell Cheryl to come in here.

208
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,599
Hey, neck-bird, come here a second!

209
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:40,636
Ugh! Why? Shut up! Why?

210
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,398
Uh, there's a mouse caught in

211
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,306
a trap, and he's still alive,

212
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,176
but his tiny little back's broken!

213
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,178
Where? Show me. I wanna see it. Where?

214
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,178
Eww!

215
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,514
[heart beating]

216
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,349
Huh.

217
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,051
- Cheryl.
- Yes, Doctor.

218
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,021
Boolean search, hypnosis,

219
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,890
and how to defend against, yes?

220
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,792
[Pam, Cheryl] Hey, Cyril, come here!

221
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,059
Why? Shut up! Why?

222
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,361
[Pam] Uh, we found Lana's diary!

223
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,430
[Cheryl] And it's all about your dong!

224
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,366
[together] Yes, Doctor.

225
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,702
See? Easy peasy zombie squeezy.

226
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,506
You still gotta get Ms. Archer, and

227
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,472
she's not a candy-ass like these ones.

228
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,143
She's 80 pounds. This stuff

229
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,842
could paralyze a gorilla.

230
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,812
- [whispers] On angel dust.
- [Malory] Wha...

231
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,880
I better not smell marijuana!

232
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:26,515
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

233
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:31,020
I swear to God, you people, the...

234
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,020
Huh.

235
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,323
- Malory.
- Yes, Doctor.

236
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:37,159
- You are under my... Ow!
- You son of a...

237
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,996
- [grunting]
- Are you out of your mind?

238
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,030
- What is wrong with you?
- Oh-ho-ho!

239
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:44,099
Walk in here with you
idiots smoking reefers

240
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,602
like a bunch of
yardbirds, and you spritz me?

241
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:48,704
- You spritz me?
- [grunting continues]

242
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,907
<i>- Well, let me tell you something, Herr Doktor!
- Oh!</i>

243
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,210
I killed seven Krauts with a shovel,

244
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:57,012
so one more beardy son
of a bitch like you

245
00:09:57,045 --> 00:10:00,882
- won't make a damn bit of difference!
- [screams]

246
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,284
- [clears throat]
- [whimpering]

247
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,620
And you!

248
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:06,222
Any questions, little Miss Blintzen?

249
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,756
- [rattling]
- [squeaky] Mm-mm.

250
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,759
And when I get back from lunch,

251
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,462
you people had better be hard at work!

252
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:17,599
[coughing]

253
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,234
I told your dumb ass...

254
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,104
[inhales sharply] Yep.

255
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,472
Back in ten minutes. Be ready.

256
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,275
Ow, ow, ow, ow. [grunts]

257
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:29,077
Ow, ow, ow, ow. [grunts]

258
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,114
Eckerd, I'm not gonna ask you again.

259
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:34,082
- Good, because I'm not gonna tell you.
- Yes, you are.

260
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,552
So, how'd you know this
wasn't a combat shotgun,

261
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,321
with, say, five rounds in the tube?

262
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:41,056
- How would I know that?
- So you just barged in?

263
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,703
What am I gonna do, Lana, stand out

264
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:44,226
in the hall the rest of my life?

265
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,428
- [Slater] One.
- [gun cocks]

266
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,630
- I...
- Two. Eckerd, I'm serious.

267
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,966
- It's got real bullets and everything.
- I...

268
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,068
I don't care. I won't tell you.

269
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,003
Slater, is that really necessary?

270
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,275
Actually, no. Could you grab me

271
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,606
a pitcher of water and a towel?

272
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,608
Wait! No, no! No! No!

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,276
No, no, no! Stop, stop,
stop! Okay, okay, okay.

274
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,445
Please. I'll tell you where he is.

275
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:04,946
- Wait, what?
- I'm waiting.

276
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,849
He didn't even pour any water on you.

277
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,017
Yeah, and he's not going to.

278
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,050
Hinkins is at the Tuntford Arms,

279
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,488
room 302, under the name "Swenders."

280
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,590
- Okay, we can be there...
- Wait a minute.

281
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,505
You give up your buddy just because some

282
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,295
dickhead threatens to waterboard you?

283
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,997
- Yes!
- Are you... How bad could it be?

284
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,000
- What? Are you kidding?
- Archer, it's...

285
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,435
- Wait. You wait.
- What?

286
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,703
How have you never been waterboarded?

287
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,005
- Why would I?
- What?

288
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,773
Gee, I don't know. Training?

289
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,107
- [chuckles] What?
- Oh, my...

290
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,709
Archer, we all had to...

291
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:36,878
- Where were you on waterboarding day?
- Uh...

292
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,982
No, no, no, no! Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

293
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:42,184
I think I'm supposed to be somewhere.

294
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:44,755
But I also think I want the lavender

295
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,155
instead of the sandalwood. Right?

296
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:48,890
- Oh, who remembers?
- I do.

297
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,992
I remember exactly where I was, Archer.

298
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,266
I was strapped to a board and so

299
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,662
convinced I was actually drowning

300
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,064
that I shit my sweatpants.

301
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,332
- Wait. Not...
- Yes! Literally!

302
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,968
- Well, that sounds terrible.
- It is terrible.

303
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,973
I can't believe you weaseled out of it.

304
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:03,205
That is so classic you!

305
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,408
[chuckles] Yeah, right? Pretty great.

306
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,343
So, should we go, or do you need to

307
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:09,245
bungle the invasion of Cuba first?

308
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,013
Mm, no. We've got a few minutes.

309
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,415
- [cocks]
- So get on the table, idiot.

310
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:16,084
[chuckles] Exqueeze me?

311
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,719
You heard him.

312
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,254
No, but seriously, don't feel bad

313
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,890
when I'm totally unfazed by this.

314
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,524
Yeah, again, it's not gonna be

315
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,927
like some homoerotic prep-school swirlie.

316
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,697
Yeah, they were kind of oddly sexual.

317
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,699
Gonna just leave that there? Lana?

318

With pleasure.

319
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,568
Plus, I bet this only affects women.

- Well, you know, people with vaginas.

321
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:39,674
- Uh-huh.
- However you choose to self-identify.

like putting stuff in guys' mouths.

325

- Aah!

327
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,889
And then clear your throat!

328
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,558
Okay. All right. I'm
ready. Let's do this.

329
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,868
And just to
reiterate, waterboarding will

330
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,928
not affect me in any way whatsoever.

331
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:03,600
[clears throat] And,
also, you have a vagina.

332

[stammering] I didn't know
it... it would be like that.

333

I mean, you... you...
you... you hear about it,

334
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,208
and you hear people say
it's bad, but you think,

335
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,010
"Oh, those people probably
have vaginas."

336
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:25,581
But I don't have a
vagina! But as God is my witness,

337
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:29,752
that was the worst thing I've
ever experienced in my...

338
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,087
Wait a minute! I've
actually drowned before!

339
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,873
Literally drowned! I was actually

340
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,523
clinically dead from drowning!

341
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:36,868
Which, looking back, I'm kind

342
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,360
of surprised I didn't remember

343

having vaginas, but...

No, no, no, no, no.

346

Do not speak to me. You

Yeah, but I... Oh, come on, Lana.

It's okay. I was gonna do that, too.

372

Hey, no! Save it for the camera.

373

All righty, I guess let's get 'em

375

[Lana] As a matter of fact, why don't

376
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,693
you just call her up and ask her out?

377

Lana...

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,797
Take her to the Brown
Derby for the early-bird special,

379
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,633
get her some chicken croquettes.

Oh, oh, oh, and some sherbet!

Oh, and how old is Ellis Crane?

386
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,646
Moot! The question is moot,

387
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,648
because I didn't make
out with Ellis Crane!

388
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,682
Hey, guys, as much as I'm loving this,

389
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,818
- what say we focus on the mission here?
- I am focused, Slater!

390
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:13,021
But once we find this
Hinkins guy, you can just...

Hinkins! Hinkins, wait! Damn it!

394
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:21,297
I'll take the lobby. You two
take that stairwell to the roof.

Oh, shut up and come on!

00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,738
- He's going up!
- Why are you still talking?

398
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,873
Well, that's a good question, Lana,

399
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,504
because obviously you can't have a

400
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,009
mature conversation about this.

401
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:37,513

- Case in point!

You can tell Slater and the rest

<i>[all squawking]</i>

472
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:32,516
Ja! Und Cyril ist Der Falkonmeister!

473
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,453
Ja, ja! Untzergrabben! Untzergrabben!

474
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,703
Oh, my God! You are hands down the

475
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,858
world's shittiest Falkonmeister.

476
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,859
What? I don't even remember that.

477
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,460
You don't have to. It's on tape.

478

<i>So now we gotta go see Jo Jo Dancer.</i>

479
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:48,398
Which better be as racist as it looks.

480
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:51,202
And you're not, like, hungover, or...

481
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:53,404
- Why would I be?
- No, I mean you wouldn't,

482
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,355
especially if you weren't exposed to

483
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,274
scopolamine or something like that.

484
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,378
Scopolamine? Why would I have been?

485
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,647
I... No, yeah, no... I... You know, I...

486
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,149
Yeah, exactly. Why?

487
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:08,219
And more importantly, how?

488
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:10,821
[Krieger] Okay,
that's... Oh, come on. Stop it.

489
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:12,641
That's just about enough of... What...

490
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,924
Well, that does it, missy!

491
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,827
- You can just cool your jets in there.
- Yes, Doctor.

492
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,430
And by "jets," obviously I
mean your actual cooling jets, so...

493
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:21,633
Yes, Doctor.

494
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,467
So, yeah, just cool your jets...

495
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,670
Oh, and as for the rest of you...

496
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:27,200
Now that I think about it, let's

497
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,072
everybody cool their respective jets.

498

[whirring]

499
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,143
Excellent. Yes.

500
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,312
Yes, very good.

501
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,716
Well, short term, anyway.
