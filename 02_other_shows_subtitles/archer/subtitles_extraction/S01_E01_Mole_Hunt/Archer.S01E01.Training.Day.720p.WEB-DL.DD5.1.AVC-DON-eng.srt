00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,607
Oh.

156
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,010
- Oh, hey hon.
- Hey back.

157
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,377
- Hello.
- What's...

158
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,280
- What's this?
- Well, see...

159
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,511
here's the thing...

160
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,124
MALORY: <i>Under no circumstance is Lana</i>
<i>to know about our little...</i>

<i>... plan.</i>

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,122
- Here's what thing?
- Okay.

163
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,386
- Archer's DD-14.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,053
That we're on our way down
to clear up with Jane.

165
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,460
- Really?
- Well...

166
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,225
you know Scatterbrain Jane.
Heh-heh.

167
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,266
- You're cooking dinner later?
- Yes, I am.

168
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,806
Speargun?

170
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:41,076
- Oh. I can't believe I just did that.
- Yeah, dunce.

171
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,575
Now Jane's a loose end.

172
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,505
Hey, Jane.

173
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,649
You getting a snack?

174
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,718
Keep your story vague.
That's lesson one.

175
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,254
But, I mean, morality aside, how
do you keep track of all these lies?

176
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:59,417
Practice, Cyril.
Lying is, like, 95 percent of what I do.

177
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:00,755
- In your job.
- Sure.

178
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,194
It was pretty cool how
you handled that speargun.

179
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,926
- Yeah, it was pretty cool.
- Will I get to learn karate?

180
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,593
Karate?
The Dane Cook of martial arts?

181
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,433
- No. ISIS agents use Krav Maga.
- Krav?

182
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,871
We've got an ex-Mossad guy,
he comes in Thursdays.

183
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:17,342
- Neat.
- Yeah. Tuesdays he does a spin class.

184
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:20,676
- So will I need sweatpants?
- Cyril. You need all new clothes.

185
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,181
What's wrong with these?

186

[LAUGHS]

Oh.

189
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,527
I was laughing at your clothes.

190
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:38,358
Wow, Archer, you were right.
A tailored suit hangs so much better.

191
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,627
ARCHER:
That's because Woodhouse is a genius.

192
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,795
Like so many other geniuses,
unappreciated in his life...

193
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,463
ARCHER:
Shut up and hem, you old fruit.

194
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:49,475
- Speaking of fruit, sir.
- Oh, sorry. Heh-heh.

195
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,409
- Cyril, check this out.
CYRIL: Watch yourself.

196
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,709
- Really?
- Don't make it weird. It's your friend.

197
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,115
- And so's this baby.
CYRIL: Jeezy Petes.

It's a Chekhov. Russian-made.

- When would you use an underwear-gun?

200
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,286
Hopefully never. But say you're...

201
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,986
in a Caribbean bungalow
and you're kind of high.

202
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,394
An exotic woman on the bed...

203
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,626
now is she just the high-priced
whore you asked for?

204
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,930

Who ordered champagne?

207
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,806
CYRIL: How should I know.
ARCHER: Exactly.

208
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,308
You're baked, can't remember.

209
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,242
Since when does it take three
huge, surly Jamaican guys...

210
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,814
to deliver one bottle of champagne?
CYRIL: Oh.

211
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,145
- Because they're assassins too.
- Or...

212
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,186
Maybe one guy's a new waiter,
the second one's training him...

213
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,883
and the third's from maintenance,
finally off his lazy ass to fix the AC.

214
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,651
Oh. Yeah, I guess that could happen.

215
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,388
Point is, you come out
of the john waving this around...

nobody's gonna bug you
for a tip. Here.

Oh, just antihistamines mostly.

- Holy shitsnacks.
- We have snacks?

Everybody's personal medical records.

- No, we can't be looking at this.

It totally should be. Look at this.

- Yeah.

ARCHER: Hey.
- Oh, Trinette.

266
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,318
It's perfectly safe. You're tangoing...

00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,720
then your trained field agent eyes
spot two threats.

268

But they're not trained.
We haven't done this yet.

269
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,292
This is how you train them. So.

- You spot your first threat. Woodhouse.
- Ooh. Hoo.

- My knees aren't...
- Bam, bam, bam.

272
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:02,060
You put him down. But just shoot
the pad, not Woodhouse.

273
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,899
- Like, actually shoot the gun?
ARCHER: Then.

274
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,337
How else are you gonna learn?
Okay, he's down...

275
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,773
just the pad.
Then you see the second threat.

276
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:11,412
Oh, no, you're out of ammo.
What are you gonna do?

277
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,241
Oh, that's where the turn comes in?

278
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,008
Duh. Woodhouse. Get in position.

279
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,981

Yeah. I did, didn't I?

- Second threat.
- Oh. Right, I forgot about...

- Second threat.

Yeah, it fricking hurt, idiot.
It's ice.

- We've only lingonberries, sir.

00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,055
I don't feel so good.

CYRIL:
Me neither.

309
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,091
And voicemail again. Huh.

310
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:38,290
So, it's me. Duh. And did you say
you'd cook, or did I mishear that?

311
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:42,164
I know I misheard you about Jane,
because turns out, I ran into her.

312
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,302
Hey, Jane.

313
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,635
You getting a tampon?

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,004
Yeah. Loose end.

315
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,442
But I'm sure you had a good reason
to lie to me...

316
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,878
so can't wait to hear what it was.

317
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:57,312
- Oh, my God, you killed a hooker.
- Call girl.

that if anything bad happened...

323
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,594
No. Do not say the Chekhov gun, Cyril.
That, sir, is a facile argument.

324
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,793
And also woefully esoteric.

No. No, I'm not happy.

Well, guess what. Me neither.

ever mention my mother's loins...

- Super high, right?
- No, low.

346

other direction with that.

who killed a perfectly good hooker.

370
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,058
By accident. We could explain.

She'd never forgive me.

00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:38,437
to make you an agent
just to impress Lana. Ironic, isn't it?

I'm not sure that's technically irony.

- Yes, it is.

doesn't deserve a woman like Lana.

Why on earth would you lie to me?

I may have injected

458
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,962
From the sweet old Korean lady?

459
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,299
Yep. How you feel about that?

460
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,035
- Like I got off pretty easy.
- Night ain't over yet.

461
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,236
- Throw me in a trunk?
- Not part of the plan.

462
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,438
Inject me with some crazy spy poison?

463
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:36,015
- It was just a harmless tranquilizer.
- You shitass.

464
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,381
I mean, let's be honest, I doubt
that's the first needle you ever...

465
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:42,079
- Ow!
- I never. Give me your wallet.

466
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:43,349
I already paid you.

467
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:47,256
File a customer service complaint.
I'm sure Popeye'd love to hear it.

468
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,863
Hey, come on, you wouldn't tell Popeye.

469
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,397
Oh, watch me.

470
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:54,194
- Oh. Give me your watch.
- You know how much this thing costs?

471
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,269
Probably less
than a new set of kneecaps.

472
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,498
- There. Happy?
- Almost.

473
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,902
You know, I bet there's a lesson
to be learned from all this.

474
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,379
But l... Oh, shit, my rug.

475
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:32,495
