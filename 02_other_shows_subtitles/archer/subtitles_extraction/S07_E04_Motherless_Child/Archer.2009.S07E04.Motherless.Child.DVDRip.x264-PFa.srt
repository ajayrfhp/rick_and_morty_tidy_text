00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:05,441
Uh-uh. Or the town,
or even the county.

159
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,441
Nope. Or even your
actual date of birth!

160
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,341
I-- Look, if this was easy

161
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,508
I wouldn't have to bury
ladies out in the desert!

162
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,474
Yeah, so did she struggle?

163
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,341
Did you have to punch her
in her bony face?

164
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:17,641
No, Creepy Spice, I used chloroform.

165
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:20,341
Aw. Yeah, her husband
didn't even wake up.

166
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,407
Damn machine.
You need a Ph.D.

167
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,407
for this thing.
It's like the Univac.

168
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:27,574
It says here "grind." It's
already ground from the store!

169
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:30,608
I just want it to drip, but
there's no button for drip!

170
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,341
What are you,
in the shower? Hello?

171
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,474
Do I need to mess with "program"?

172
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:39,474
And because it was a closed adoption
with any record of it sealed,

173
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:43,241
we need to basically hack into the
state's vital records database,

174
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:44,641
and comb through millions of records!

175
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:46,374
Yeah, so then do that.

176
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,741
I-- [sighs] But even
if we could hack in--

177
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,774
Their password security's
probably just eight-bit,

178
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,508
so I'd suggest a combination
of dictionary attack,

179
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,508
reverse cryptographic hash function,

180
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,508
and good old-fashioned
brute force.

181
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,341
Oh, we can do that?
Lemon squeezy.

182
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,541
Oh, okay, but my larger,
sort of overall concern

183
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,274
is that it's a felony.

184
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,474
Well, but so is
painting the walls in here

185
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,508
with you people's tiny brains.

186
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,274
[all gasp] Yeah, so whaddya
say we "get crackin'"?

187
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:11,608
[chuckles]

188
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:14,508
See what I did there?
Pun-wise?

189
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,307
Samuel Johnson tells us that puns
are the lowest form of comedy,

190
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,542
but for me it's murder.

191
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,756
[Archer] Damn it, people, my
mother is buried alive!

192
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,756
What is taking so long?

193
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,589
We're going as fast as we can!

194
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,456
And why is it so frickin' hot?

195
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,589
What? Why do you think?

196
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,723
To crack the password we need

197
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,756
every last bit of
this computing power!

198
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,822
Still though...
It is pretty hot.

199
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,922
Sweet Jesus Metal Christ!
Whoa, my God!

200
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,822
What's the matter?
C'mon, Lana.

201
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,523
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

202
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,855
Wait, what?
Yeah, dude,

203
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,556
me and her b-b-b-boned. What?

204
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,556
Did I know this?
When was this?

205
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,756
Way back!
When he was, ya know...

206
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:59,723
What, back when
I was what, Lana? Human?

207
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,723
I mean--
I still have feelings!

208
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,723
Well, then put some damn clothes on!

209
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:05,723
No, no!
You can just feast

210
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:09,689
your beady little eyes
on my... endoskeleton!

211
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,889
[excitedly gasps] Here's an idea!
Turn on the A/C!

212
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,589
[Pam]
Yeah, right!

213
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,855
We're way over maximum voltage.

214
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,689
I got about
a buck-fifty in pennies

215
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,556
crammed in the fusebox as it is.

216
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,822
[all groaning]
Oh, relax.

217
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,889
Worst case, an innocent
migrant farmhand

218
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,789
goes to turn on the milking
machine and gets electrocuted.

219
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,589
What? I mean, worst case
we fry some circuits.

220
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,789
Hmm...
What?

221
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,556
I mean, how's Mother?

222
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,689
I wanna see her,
put her up on the monitor.

223
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,789
Okay!
But just for a second.

224
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,523
Oh and keep it
on "mute." Carol.

225
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:43,556
[all groaning]
[Barry chuckles]

226
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,422
Yeah, she's really losing her shit.

227
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:47,822
...hunt you bastards down

228
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,889
and have your guts for
garters, you hear me?

229
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,489
My God, get it together.

230
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,789
You've been in tighter spots
than this.

231
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,456
East Berlin, Warsaw.
Ugh, Khartoum?

232
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,789
At least this time you're not
hooked up to a car battery.

233
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,456
Or up to your ankles in camel blood.

234
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,789
And whoever these bastards are,

235
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,623
they must not want you dead just yet.

236
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,389
But what do they want?
And where is this?

237
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,723
[sighs] Well, it's
hard to say, really.

238
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,389
I mean, we're computating
as fast as we can,

239
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,456
but every possible
permutation of this password

240
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,822
is something on the order of
ten to the ninth power, so--

241
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:22,789
Got it! Wait, what? Wait, what?

242
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,389
[muttering]
Whoo!

243
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,723
Can't hear anything.

244
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,656
Although I can feel just
the slightest draft, but...

245
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:33,422
[deep sniff] Hm. Maybe
a hint of diesel?

246
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,456
Doesn't help much,
that could be anywhere.

247
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,589
Although "anywhere" usually
has some kind of sounds.

248
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,756
Traffic, birds, a train.
Here there's just nothing.

249
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,756
Could-- Damn it,
I'm underground!

250
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:48,855
But what kind of
sick, twisted, bastard...

251
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,855
Whoo! Barry's
baggin' some tea!

252
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,589
[thrusting sounds]

253
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,456
I suppose there's really no telling.

254
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,855
You spend your whole
life in espionage,

255
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,422
you're going to make a few enemies.

256
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:03,422
But kiddo, you're not gonna
sit here on your keister

257
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:07,690
waiting to find out who's
behind this. So. Step one.

258
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:14,523
And now for step two.

259
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:17,422
[inhales, grunts]

260
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,523
[exhales] Step two's always a bitch.

261
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,822
All right, now step three.

262
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:24,724
[grunting]

263
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,723
[Barry] Okay, so now what, now what?

264
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:30,689
Well, I think the first
thing we should do

265
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,723
is make Pam put on some clothes.

266
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,556
Don't try to body shame me!

267
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,822
Dog Tits!
Yeah, shut up.

268
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:38,389
[sighs] So now, we have to go through

269
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,822
all these millions
of records line by line,

270
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:42,889
looking for any records
with your given name,

271
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,556
and hope we can
cross-reference that

272
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,689
to find some record of
your birth mother's name.

273
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,556
What? How long is
that gonna take?

274
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,623
I-- Awhile, Archer.

275
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,556
Oh, well then, can I borrow Krieger?

276
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,589
No. How does that help the situation?

277
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,789
It helps my leg, Cyril,

278
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,889
which I think might be
turning septic,

279
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,656
thanks to your new
best friend, Darth Barry!

280
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,789
You do realize I'm not
that kind of a doc--

281
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,689
Krieger, break room now, goddamn it!
So, is it cool if I--

282
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,556
Yeah, but give him some morphine
or something to shut him up,

283
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,556
'cause I've really got this warm,
hopeful feeling right now,

284
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,523
and I kinda feel like
it's gonna be ruined

285
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:18,523
if I have to pull his spine
out through his face.

286
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,523
Um, and also can I go
to the bathroom? No.

287
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,756
Then why does Archer get
to do whatever he wants

288
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:26,855
plus morphine when you're not
even my robot supervisor!

289
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:30,623
Okay, Jesus, go to the bathroom.

290
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,822
Well, if she's going-- Everybody
go to the damn bathroom!

291
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,556
Go crazy, use the frickin' bidet!

292
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,389
I'm not the one
running out of oxygen here.

293
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,589
Oh right, I forgot about Miss Archer.

294
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,689
Although...
[grunts]

295
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,822
step three's no prize.
[groans]

296
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,822
Aha!

297
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,822
And now, for these damn cuffs!

298
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:54,523
[Krieger]
You lost me.

299
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,889
I want you to Edison this elephant.

300
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,789
Ooo-kay.
Nope, still lost.

301
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,756
Thomas Edison! Remember?
When he killed that elephant

302
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:06,656
by jamming a big, fat
electric cable up its asshole?

303
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,523
What?
Yeah.

304
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:10,489
The kindly Wizard of Menlo Park,

305
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,689
bought a sweet old circus
elephant just to murder it.

306
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,756
Now I want you to figure
out a way to zap Barry

307
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:17,422
with enough juice
to shut down his CPU.

308
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:21,456
Uh, okay, like-- Like, just brick him.
[zapping sound]

309
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:24,556
But the KGB built him. I'm sure
all his circuits are shielded.

310
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,723
It would take like,
gigawatts worth of volts.

311
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:29,523
Okay, that doesn't sound right.
It's not.

312
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:30,689
But how many volts do
you think we have with

313
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,723
two pounds of pennies
jammed in the fusebox?

314
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,556
Hmm, and if I routed it
all to a single circuit,

315
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,389
like the dimmer switch
in the bullpen,

316
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,723
maybe spilled an electrolytic
solution on the floor

317
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:42,556
for good measure, and get Barry
to touch said dimmer switch...

318
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,456
Wait, what happened to jamming

319
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,689
a big, fat electric
cable up his asshole?

320
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,689
Well, A, I don't think he even has
an asshole, not that I was looking,

321
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,855
and B, a dimmer switch is way easier.

322
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:54,623
Okay, but-- But wait,
if you fry Barry's CPU,

323
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,523
he can't tell you
where Miss Archer is!

324
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:58,855
Well, I'll worry about that
bridge when I come to it!

325
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,556
I kinda think you should
worry about it before then.

326
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,822
Krieger, if I worried about
a fraction of the stuff

327
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,656
I should be worried about,
I'd never get anything done!

328
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,689
I know, but--
Oh my God, BPA!

329
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,790
I--
Transgendered frogs!

330
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:17,456
[frog bribbit]
Shh, shh, shh.

331
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,789
[Gillette] What? I said
I'm in love with Barry.

332
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,523
[toilet flushes] [laughs]
I knew that was coming.

333
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,889
Oh, my tits, what? How could--
He's a frickin machine!

334
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,855
Well, Ray, a machine
is like a desert.

335
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,756
Either it fascinates or appalls you.

336
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:32,556
What? It's not "noice!"
Noyce.

337
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,789
How could you be attracted
to a homicidal maniac?

338
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,489
No, that's a quote by Wilfrid Noyce.

339
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,589
Really?
What? Yes!

340
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,723
The mountaineer?
Yes!

341
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,656
Well, here's a quote by me:

342
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:45,889
Barry's about to violate
the First Law of Robotics...

343
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,855
[whispers]
on my vagina.

344
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,855
[chuckling]
Noice.

345
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:54,489
Ha! Now just to see
where the hell I am...

346
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,723
What? Oh, for the love!

347
00:14:56,724 --> 00:15:00,889
Although, no matter who
or what ends up killing me,

348
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,623
you could probably
paint that on the wall.

349
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:06,490
The idiot.

350
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,589
Let's go, people.
The clock is ticking.

351
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,165
Tick tock, tick tock.

352
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,414
Name something a clock would say.

353
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,348
Barry, you could, ya know, help!

354
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:21,648
[chuckles]
I'm too wound up!

355
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,648
Name something a clock would--
Ray.

356
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,148
Seriously.
I could maybe help you unwind.

357
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,214
[Lana] Ugh. Didn't I
murder you one time?

358
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:32,314
Maybe...
[Archer] Carol!

359
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,581
Get back to work, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

360
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:37,281
Well, you guys were
all pretty sweaty,

361
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,648
so I brought you
some Sports Drank to--

362
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:44,214
Oh, damn it! Damn.
Damn. Damn. Damn it!

363
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,681
Probably because
it's so dark in here.

364
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,548
Yeah, Archer, it is getting dark,

365
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,281
which means your mommy is running out

366
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,214
of both time and oxygen!

367
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:54,214
It also means potentially
dangerous eye-strain

368
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:55,548
for these hardworking folks, Barry.

369
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,681
So why don't you go over there
and turn up that dimmer?

370
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:00,448
You turn up the damn dimmer!
No, Barry, you do it!

371
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,181
Ugh, Jesus, I'll turn up
the stupid dimmer.

372
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:05,515
Carol, no! Don't touch that dimmer!
Wait a minute...

373
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,348
Why do you want me
to touch the light switch?

374
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,448
Hm? And all the sports drank
conveniently spilled

375
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,615
on the floor, full of electrolytes?

376
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:16,348
Is it? Are you trying
to electrocute me?

377
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,348
[gasps]
What, no!

378
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:21,314
[Krieger screams]
[sighs] Apparently not.

379
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,381
If I was electrocuted, how the hell
were you gonna find your mother?

380
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,214
So there were a couple of holes!

381
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,181
[Pam] Wait, are we doing-- Jesus!

382
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:32,181
You were willing to risk that?
Oh, that is classic you!

383
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:33,548
A mother!
The one thing

384
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,414
I've been searching for
my entire goddamn life,

385
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,648
and you take it for granted!

386
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,481
Just like you do
with everything else!

387
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,248
Shut up!
Well, guess what!

388
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:42,648
You take your mother
for granted? Fine!

389
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,348
Good luck finding her
without the coordinates!

390
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:47,214
[all gasping]
What the shit?

391
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,415
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

392
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:55,248
[exhales] First thing, I'm
taking a long hot bath

393
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,381
with a nice stiff drink.

394
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,581
[grunts]

395
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:04,348
And then I'm going to kill everybody!

396
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,414
Yeah?
Well, get in line, lady!

397
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,414
[all]
Hey, whoa! Calm down!

398
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:11,214
After I kill
all you idiots, I'm--

399
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,648
- [Pam] I found her!
- [All muttering]

400
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,414
Found who? Your mom! At
least I think I did.

401
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,615
[all chattering]
Let me see.

402
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:21,515
So, the Hide-A-Wee
Home For Children...

403
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:24,314
That's where I grew up!
Took in a newborn baby,

404
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,548
born at County Hospital
close to your dates,

405
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,381
who was christened
Bartholomew Aloysius Dylan.

406
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,548
That's me!
Little baby Barty D.!

407
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,581
And, according to
County Hospital's records,

408
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:37,615
the baby was put up for adoption
by a young woman named...

409
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,515
You sure you wanna know this?

410
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,582
[gunfire]
[all clamoring]

411
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,548
Yeah.
[sighs]

412
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,481
Tammy Jo Stamps, age 16.

413
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,715
Holy shitsnacks!

414
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,615
And she's still alive, you guys!

415
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,248
She lives in L.A.!

416
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,581
[all muttering]

417
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:59,448
[bawling] Well? What
are you waiting for?

418
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,515
You got what you wanted!

419
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,214
Go to her!

420
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,681
Just go!

421
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:09,248
I mean, yeah, right?
I mean, right?

422
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,314
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

423
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:14,381
But what? I mean, you
can't go like that.

424
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,515
Why, what are you...

425
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh my God, I look
like the Terminator!

426
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,214
Well, a Terminator.

427
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:23,615
I think I may have just the thing.

428
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:25,581
Okay, I was kinda saving this for...

429
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,515
this other thing, but anyhoo.

430
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,581
[all gasping]

431
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,515
What the shit, Krieger?

432
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:34,281
What?

433
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:38,281
Why do you have our heads?

434
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:41,515
And hands. What, it's for this other...
nothing.

435
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:45,248
So! Who's it
gonna be, big guy?

436
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,715
[chuckling]

437
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,515
Holy shit, now I know you're crazy.

438
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,414
What, you thought I'd pick you?

439
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,648
I mean...
Or Gillette?

440
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,314
[chuckles] The poor
man's Frank Langella?

441
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,548
Oh my God, I am.

442
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,581
No, this is the face.
How do I look?

443
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:02,381
[all muttering]

444
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,448
Yeah, right?
Okay, so...

445
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:07,481
Wow! Off to meet
my birth mother.

446
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:11,214
Wish me luck, friends!
[all] Good luck.

447
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,581
[chuckles]
Thanks, guys!

448
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,349
[brakes screeching]
[all] Oh!

449
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:22,281
[Barry]
I'm okay!

450
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,548
[sarcastic muttering]

451
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:27,414
[sighs]
Like a bad penny.

452
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,215
Oh, shit!
The pennies!

453
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:41,583
[Lana]
So, what did we learn?

454
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,782
[muttering]

455
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,090
I learned...
Wow.

456
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,749
Nothing?
Nope.

457
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,416
I learned that the cabinet

458
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,483
of Dr. Krieger is
full of our faces.

459
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,649
And hands.
I-- Look,

460
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,416
don't worry about it. I
really feel like we should.

461
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,682
Oh, you worry about everything.

462
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:59,882
Oh, shit!
I hope Mother's okay.

463
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:01,617
[dopey laugh]

464
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:06,145
[trucker]
Evenin'.

465
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:09,782
I'll give you $1,000 for a
ride to the nearest bar.

466
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,483
[trucker laughs]
What?

467
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,749
Oh, shit yeah, lady, climb on up!

468
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,583
[groans] Yeah, there ya
go, get on up in here.

469
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,616
[Malory groans]
Whew. Thank you.

470
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:23,682
[trucker chuckles] Thank you.
A thousand bucks?

471
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,550
You're either crazy or rich or both.

472
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:29,583
[Malory] Well, I don't have
it on me obviously, but...

473
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,616
[trucker] Oh, I betcha we
can work something out.

474
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:36,550
[Malory] Ahem, your hand
seems to be on my thigh.

475
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,583
[trucker] Yeah, you're
like a silver fox.

476
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:40,782
[Malory]
I beg your pardon?

477
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,616
[trucker]
And I'm just hopin'

478
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,483
them curtains match the rug,
'cause I like that.

479
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,416
[Malory sighs]

480
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,516
[punching]

481
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,583
[groans, chokes]

482
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,782
[coughing]

483
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,782
[Malory] Ya like an
elbow to the throat?

484
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,550
Shit heel.

485
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,416
Although, if you had worded
that a bit more delicately

486
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,583
it could've been
quite flattering, so...

487
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:06,816
well, not thank you,
necessarily, but...

488
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,029
[choking]

489
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:12,782
[Malory] Je ne sais quoi.
Exactement. Ciao!

490
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,650
[continues choking]

491
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,782
