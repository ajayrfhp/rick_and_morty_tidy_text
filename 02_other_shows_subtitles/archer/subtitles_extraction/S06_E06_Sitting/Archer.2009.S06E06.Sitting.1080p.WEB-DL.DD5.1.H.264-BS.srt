1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,335
[lana]
so, that bag is clothes.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,671
That bag is diapers.
The cooler is breast milk,

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,374
Which obviously needs
to go in the--
where do you buy breast milk?

4
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,376
[sighs]
you don't, archer. You--

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,378
[laughs]
oh, my god, will you relax?

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,446
Here. Have a cold-- wow.

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,481
So no beer?

8
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,116
Why would I bring beer?

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,118
Because you don't want me
drinking liquor?

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,953
I don't want you
drinking anything!

11
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,522
What, that's all for her?
I'll find a sitter.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,958
Lana, relax.
I won't drink while you're gone.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,027
I take this very seriously.

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,728
Well, or at least
woodhouse does.

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,464
Yeah, and if he was here--
wait. What?
Where is he?

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,866
[whispers]
rehab.

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,501
Oh, seriously?

18
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,303
I know. At his age,
it's like, why even bother?

19
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,705
Well?
I'm kidding.

20
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,640
It's his annual
three days off.

21
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,510
It's normally two,
but I let him roll over one
from last year.

22
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:47,079
Your largesse knows no bounds.

23
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,148
Well, it's not paid.
Ugh!

24
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,016
Have you at least
baby-proofed this place?

25
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,985
I don't think a baby
can hurt anything.

26
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,988
No, not-- ugh!
I mean, like firearms,
for instance.

27
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,556
Are they stored securely?

28
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,758
[rattles]
yes.

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,894
I'll find a sitter.
Lana, go.

30
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,263
A.J.'s in good hands.
I know what I'm doing.

31
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,266
E read ten
the   <i>baby-sitters club  </i> books.

32
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,501
Really?
Yeah. I'm totally
a kristy,

33
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,871
With maybe, like,
a dash of claudia.
Because I won't have my phone.

34
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,507
So when you realize
you can't handle it--
I won't.

35
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,209
But when you do--
please shut up--

36
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,211
This is the main number
at the zen center.

37
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,180
And a staff member
will come and find me.

38
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,749
In your stupid--
what is it, a wigwam?

39
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,452
It's a yurt.
Wow. Even stupider.

40
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,120
Archer, I'm serious.
Me too.

41
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:31,023
Paying to spend 24 hours
sweating in a yurt

42
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,292
Is literally the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

43
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,528
Oh, I can think
of a few more.
You're right.

44
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,264
Maybe this will help you shed
some of your negative energy.

45
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,134
My--
have fun. Say hi
to your spirit animal.

46
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,370
Ugh! Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

47
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,573
[singsong voice]
but I bet you call
before then!

48
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,775
[scoffs]
I bet I won't.

49
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,110
[muffled muttering]

50
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,244
[gulps, coughs]

51
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,279
Holy shit,
I gotta wash that down.

52
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,381
See that, a.J.?
That was a teachable moment
[cooing]

53
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,383
About a little thing
called confidence.

54
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,452
And contrary to what
you may have heard,

55
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,088
You can never have
too much of it.

56
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,124
Or bourbon.
Where's the bourbon?

57
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,793
Okay, I gotta have some irish,
or at least some scotch,

58
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,328
Or blended, or--

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,297
Jesus christ, woodhouse,
stock the bar!

60
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,399
Okay, here we go.
So we have...

61
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,835
Ugh, tequila and coffee liqueur.

62
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,904
All right.
So we can make...

63
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,507
I guess this will be
a... Black mexican?

64
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,309
[fussing]
what? No, that's not racist.

65
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,145
That's what it is.
If you added milk,

66
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,681
It would be a white mexican,
but all we have is breast milk--

67
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,418
Eww, which would make it
a rusty krieger.

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,087
[slurps]
oh!

69
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,823
Oh, god. Wow.
That is   <i>mierda.</i>

70
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,191
And also between us, okay?

71
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,826
Because your mom
likes to worry, a.J.,

72
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,161
But she doesn't need to,

73
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,962
Because when
you're with me, kid,

74
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,365
You're as safe as a bug in a...
[door thuds open]

75
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,799
Archer!
Help!

76
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,035
Please help!
He's been shot!
[groaning]

77
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,138
[a.J. Crying]
oh, good.

78
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,307
For a second,
I thought you were lana.

79
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:59,211
[groaning continues]
[belches]

80
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:04,283
<i>â™ª</i>

81
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,417
[slater]
where's the goddamn
first aid kit?

82
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,419
[archer]
behind the bar.
And quit yelling.

83
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,853
[man]
aahhh! Ow!
[blow lands]

84
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,021
Why did you hit me?

85
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,590
'cause!
Get your shit together!

86
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,391
Get your shit together, man.
[a.J. Crying]

87
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,826
You're the one
who's bleeding to death.

88
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,828
Yeah. From my ears.
So shut up!

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,530
[archer]
everybody shut up,

90
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,032
Because, spoiler alert,
this is a baby.

91
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,168
And why do you
have a baby?

92
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,103
Well, slater.
When a mommy and a daddy

93
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,438
Love each other very much--

94
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,672
In your apartment!

95
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,742
Yeah. Or a motel
or a porta-john,

96
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,444
Or--
are you trying
to piss me off?

97
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,612
[chuckling]
not really.

98
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,180
Well, you are, so...

99
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,449
Why do you keep your
first aid kit in the bar?

100
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,685
Because that's where over
80% of home accidents happen.

101
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,388
Wow. Really?
They happen in the bathroom!

102
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,023
Not in my home.
Speaking of which,

103
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,225
Why are you in it,
and who is he?

104
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,395
Sterling archer,
this is farooq ashkani.

105
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,796
Yeah. Hi.

106
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,398
Black mexican?
What?

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,967
Uh, hey, dick,
I happen to be pakistani.

108
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,703
[speaking urdu]

109
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,138
I was offering you a drink,

110
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,041
But all I have is tequila
and coffee liqueur.

111
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,043
Sorry. I thought
you were being racist.

112
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,745
No. If anything,
you were,

113
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,648
If you think black
or mexican is an insult.

114
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,717
My child is actually
multiracial, so--

115
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,819
Hang on. Go back.
You speak urdu?

116
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,455
Huh? Oh. No. No, no.
Just that one phrase.

117
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,058
The only phrase
you know in urdu is,

118
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,560
"no, shit,
you goat-raping pig-devil"?

119
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,297
What? I thought it mean,
"I'm sorry."

120
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,966
Huh. Probably why that night
in a karachi whorehouse

121
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,669
Suddenly went from pretty bad
to much worse.

122
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,404
I'm gonna stop you there.

123
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,572
Somebody should.
I mean, this is a baby.

124
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,141
Because time's
a bit of a factor.

125
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,276
Until yesterday,
farooq was a cyberspy

126
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,744
For pakistani intelligence.

127
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,813
But now he wants
to come over to our side.

128
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,848
Are we not
on the same side?

129
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,450
Eh...
Eh...

130
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,786
Anyway, I was walking him
into a cia safe house,

131
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,088
But a bunch of his former
colleagues were waiting for us.

132
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,956
I had to shoot
our way out of there.

133
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,792
But how did
they know where the--
[gasps]

134
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:30,295
Oh, my god,
could the cia have a leak?

135
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,864
That's what I said!

136
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,667
Anyway, until I find the leak
and plug it,

137
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,169
I need you
to babysit him.

138
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,004
And I object
to the term "babysit,"

139
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,706
Because clearly
I am not a baby.

140
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,341
And I'm already babysitting

141
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,210
What clearly is
an actual baby, so...
[cooing]

142
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,479
She sure is.
Can I hold her?

143
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,614
Uh, yeah. Okay.

144
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,983
But, you know, be careful.
I got her.

145
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,352
There we go.

146
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,986
Archer, come on.
No.

147
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,521
24 hours.
No!

148
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,323
And a hundred grand.
Yes!

149
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,625
Okay, good. I'll call you
after I deal with the leak,

150
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,627
Then you'll bring him
to the new safe house.

151
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,196
And payment will be...

152
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,398
By wire transfer.
Is that a problem?

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,033
No. I just didn't know

154
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,635
If I should bring my sack
with the big dollar sign on it.

155
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,171
Just bring him.
And I need to borrow a shirt.

156
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,506
Farooq?

157
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,875
Um...

158
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,144
Why do you-- [scoffs]
never mind.

159
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,012
There's a logic to all of it.

160
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,215
Aw, you're
absolutely insane.

161
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,517
[chuckling]
crazy...
[muttering]

162
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,219
[door closes]
is he gone?

163
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,088
Yeah, he's--
because he's kind of
a dick, right?

164
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,891
Right.
And what's the deal
with that safe house?

165
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,394
Am I right? Come on.
They should call it a...

166
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,696
Misnomer house.

167
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,698
But this place is safe,
though, right?

168
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Yeah, I mean--
yeah, I mean,
it's the penthouse.

169
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,502
And I assume that's
the only door, so--

170
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,903
Well, except for
the terrace, but--

171
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,005
Yeah, so maybe we should
lock that?

172
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,407
[fussing]
hey. Shh.

173
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,175
Sorry. I was just
kind of freaking out.

174
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,610
I just saw a guy get shot.

175
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,211
Well, if you
get her started again,

176
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,881
You're gonna see you
get shot, so--
yeah, okay.

177
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:59,184
So you have guns here, right?
Yes. I literally
have tons of them.

178
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,585
Yeah, but--
hang on.

179
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,587
Not literally,
but a lot.

180
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,524
Yeah. Okay.
But on you, I mean, like...

181
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,526
Are you strapped?
[laughing]

182
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,896
Am I strapped?
No, homie, I'm not.

183
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,064
Okay, so you don't
have a gun on you,

184
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,232
Is what I'm saying.

185
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,135
And no is what I'm saying.

186
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,304
Okay, good.
Wh--

187
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,374
That's just gonna make
this next part a lot easier.

188
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,543
Well, for me.

189
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,549
[laughing]

190
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,718
Oh, my god.
Okay. Good stuff.

191
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,721
You had me going
there for a second.
[laughs] I'm sorry.

192
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,924
I can't believe
lana set this up.

193
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,059
Just so I'd call
and ask for help.

194
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,463
And you got slater in on it?
With the fake blood?

195
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,465
Oh, man.
She is pathetic.

196
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,732
Aah!
[crying]

197
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,235
What the shit?
You shot me!

198
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,903
I wanted your full attention.

199
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,738
Well, you nailed it, asshole!

200
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,408
Jesus christ! Did lana pay you
extra too shoot me?

201
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,310
Okay, I don't know
this lana, but--

202
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,945
I'm sorry?
Yeah. Me too.

203
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,347
She sounds like
a real practical joker.

204
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,251
But I assure you, mr. Archer,
this is all very real.

205
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,987
Hey, hey, now, listen to me,
all right?

206
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,622
Listen. I don't know
what's going on,

207
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,190
But you're gonna
hand me the baby.

208
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,092
No, mr. Archer,
I am not.

209
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,194
Not until you take me
to your headquarters

210
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,296
So I can access
the mainframe computer.

211
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,599
Yeah, I heard you,
but I'm not going anywhere

212
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,168
Until you put it up there.
Fine. Whatever.

213
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,170
[tires screeching]

214
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,347
Wow! You drive like
a gaping dickhole.

215
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,683
[grunts]

216
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,953
<i>â™ª [muzak]</i>
<i>so I guess there's</i>
<i>no cia leak.</i>

217
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,022
Nope. My follow team
created a diversion

218
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,690
So that slater would
bring me to you,

219
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,158
So that you
would bring me here.

220
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,393
Just don't hurt her.

221
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,061
Well, I hope
it won't come to that.

222
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,663
You really, really should.

223
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,131
Just make sure
there are no surpris--

224
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,166
[pam]
god damn it!

225
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,068
What the--
it's Friday night.

226
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,537
Why the hell are people
still here?

227
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,338
I don't know.
I guess it's--

228
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,841
Jeezy petes!
An inside straight?

229
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,176
[all grumbling]

230
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,712
Got three on the hip,
I need four for the weekend.

231
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,247
I'm going to hotlanta.

232
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,182
Have fun,
I hope you get hate-crimed.

233
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,250
Hey, whoa!

234
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,518
Goddamn, woman.
Seriously.

235
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,687
I'll hate-crime your ass
right here.

236
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,689
[gillette]
you know what?
Guys, come on.

237
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,258
Can't we have one poker night
without a hate crime?

238
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,762
Okay, a, the thing last month
wasn't a hate crime...

239
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,897
Because I will
straight-flush your brains

240
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,699
Out the back of your skull!

241
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,200
It was just a regular crime.

242
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,902
And obviously now I put my gun

243
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,904
In the time-lock safe
until the game's over.

244
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,073
And so basically,
the only thing keeping you

245
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,176
From murdering each other is
a lack of access to firearms.

246
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,612
Works for canada.
Nothing works for canada.

247
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,846
[archer]
hey guys...

248
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,882
[greetings]

249
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,283
Is-- are you playing
strip poker?

250
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,952
[together]
no.

251
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,621
It just gets hot
as balls in here.
Literally.

252
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,889
Okay, well--
hang on.

253
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,457
Yeah, literally.

254
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,293
Right, I just came by
because, uh--
aha!

255
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,729
Because you need help with the
baby and you can't call lana,

256
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,731
So you came to ask
one of us for help.

257
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,299
For your information, cyril,

258
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,603
I don't need help with a.J.
Because I, uh...

259
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,104
Hired a manny.

260
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,607
Hey, I'm... Manny.

261
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,641
[general mumbles of greeting]

262
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,076
Black mexican?

263
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,611
No, thank you,
I probably shouldn't.

264
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,712
Shouldn't what?

265
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,914
Uh, swarm across
the rio grande?

266
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,948
From pakistan?

267
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,116
Where's woodhouse?

268
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,718
My guess, avenue d.

269
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,621
Anyhoo, we just,
um, gotta grab...

270
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,055
Some baby stuff.

271
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,058
So, we're gonna go do that.
Manny?

272
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,228
Good luck with your...
Hate-cards.

273
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,564
Pff, go back to canada,
guy lafleur.

274
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,400
Okay, ante up,
ya goat-raping pig devils!

275
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,835
Nothing wild but the dealer.

276
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,003
Hang on a sec.

277
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,237
Did archer seem a little,
like...

278
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,572
Scared to you guys?

279
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,840
[dismissing]

280
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,341
Ya know, now that you
mention it,

281
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,176
He did actually seem
a little nervous.

282
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,845
[accepting]

283
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,647
I bet he's just on the c.D.L.

284
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,583
The what?
Canadian down-low.

285
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,818
Please, like you all
wouldn't bang alan thicke

286
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,120
If you had the chance.

287
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,489
I think we should
go check it out.

288
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,424
Well, if we're not
gonna play poker!

289
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,626
I thought this was ouija.

290
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,361
So, those guys...

291
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,497
Kinda dicks, right?
Right?

292
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,700
Totally. Okay, now enter
the command sequence string.

293
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,769
Okay good, now once you've...

294
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,103
Entered that...

295
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,772
Wow, still working on it.

296
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,840
You also type
like a gaping dickhole.

297
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,308
Sorry, I don't wanna mess up.

298
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,544
Man, you are nothing
like your file.

299
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,780
All these stories about
what a badass you are,

300
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,282
But I gotta tell ya,
farooq's not seeing it.

301
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,184
Well, in those stories,
I'm probably not

302
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,852
Changing poopy diapers, so--

303
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,454
So do you seriously
not even care

304
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,689
What I'm doing
with your mainframe?

305
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,123
I honestly don't.

306
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,525
Okay, I'm going
to tell you anyway.

307
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,894
I'm using it to backdoor
my state-of-the-art

308
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:39,230
Spyware into the cia network,
so pakistani intelligence

309
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,866
Will know everything
they do in real time.

310
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,369
And... Why are you
telling me this?

311
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,804
I'm -- wait, what?

312
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,639
I mean, now I'm just
gonna tell the cia,

313
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,574
And they'll find the spyware.

314
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,010
That was only one
of many, many

315
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,479
Possible things
I could be doing.
Okay.

316
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,248
No, no, and the very fact
that I told you

317
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,918
That's what I'm doing,
I mean that was

318
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,520
Clearly misdirection, right?
Okay.

319
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,255
Plus, I doubt you'll
be talking very much

320
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,824
After I shoot you
in the face.

321
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,492
Take it easy, I--
(small gasp)

322
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,527
Shit! I don't have a will!

323
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,262
I'm a notary!
Wha--?

324
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,998
What the shit, manny?

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,934
[struggling, baby crying]

326
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,836
Pam! Baby!

327
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,037
[pam screaming]

328
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,673
What the heck's going on in--

329
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,908
[growls]

330
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,711
[growls]

331
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,847
Well, ya don't see
that everyday.

332
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,715
I didn't even see it today...

333
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,885
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[crashes]

334
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,520
So, here's the thing, farooq.

335
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,021
I don't know about any stories,

336
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,024
But whatever badass shit
that you heard I did,

337
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,427
You really need
some context, because

338
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,063
Pretty much my whole life,
pretty much right up until

339
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,800
This minute, my default setting
has been "half-ass."

340
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,769
But that was before
I had a child,

341
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,904
A child you threatened to harm.

342
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,207
A child, I just realized,
who's probably on her way up

343
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,945
To the roof so aunt pam
can swat at biplanes.

344
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,214
Wait, what the hell am I doing?

345
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,750
The roof's the first place
they'll look.

346
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,787
So imagine, as I literally
beat you to death--

347
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,555
Hang on. Yeah, literally,

348
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,124
That a giant hand
has turned my dial

349
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,794
From "half-ass"
to "quadruple-ass."

350
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,096
Wow. That is a lot of ass.

351
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,598
Yeah, basically eight times
the ass.

352
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,101
Can I just say one thing,
before we get into all

353
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,469
The beating to death?

354
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,737
What?
[gun unsheathing, being cocked]

355
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,172
I still have a gun?

356
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,242
Oh, right.

357
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,981
[gillette]
well? What's going
on in there?

358
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,483
Okay, so...

359
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,518
That lesbian au pair has a gun.

360
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
I think she's robbing
mr. Archer.

361
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,822
[together]
wait, what? What au pair?

362
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,123
The black mexican.

363
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,858
Oh for--
so what should we do?

364
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,794
Nothing!
Until we consult the ouija.

365
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,629
God I love poker night.

366
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,966
So, before you shoot me,
can I just say one thing?

367
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,168
What?

368
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,471
[screams]

369
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,706
What the shit, cyril?

370
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,808
[gasping]

371
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,510
Really?

372
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,612
Take cover!
C'mon, cyril.

373
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,514
[panicking]

374
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,015
There's other desks.

375
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,884
This one's good.
Ow. Damn it!

376
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,553
This is exactly
how brett died.

377
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,956
[sigh]
man, I wish he was
still with us.

378
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,859
[chuckling]
he could soak up
some of these bullets.

379
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,494
God, finally. Okay,
that's eight rounds,

380
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,163
Including the one
in my shoulder, so he's--

381
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,031
[farooq]
reloading!
God dammit.

382
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,466
Oh! Ray, gun.

383
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,369
It's in a time-lock safe.
What? Why?

384
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,704
Because cheryl.

385
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,239
[farooq]
I'm calling for backup.

386
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,407
[speaking urdu]

387
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,878
What'd he say?
Well, my urdu isn't
as strong as I thought.

388
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,881
[speaking urdu]

389
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,884
Meh.
But I'm gonna assume
he just called for backup.

390
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,385
So we gotta get to the armory.

391
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,519
It's empty.
It's--

392
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,154
What do you mean, it's empty?

393
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,190
When we got shut down,
that guy--

394
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,391
Kevin. Kyle?

395
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,326
Keith? Kenny? Kieran.

396
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,895
Rodney?
Rodney.

397
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,162
Why was I thinking kev--

398
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,898
He stole everything.

399
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,767
He set himself up in europe
as some kind of arms dealer.

400
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,236
Gentlemen, I'm afraid you
mistake my hospitality

401
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,739
For weakness.
The price is the price.

402
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,741
If you wish to negotiate,
you may do so

403
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,344
With my associates.

404
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,779
[evil laugh]

405
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,547
And apparently
he's doing quite well.

406
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,750
[yelping]
[farooq]
reloading!

407
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,286
[annoyed sigh]
remind me, if this asshole
doesn't kill all of you,

408
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,420
To do it for him.

409
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,455
[chuckling]
uh, no.

410
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,557
And take that
ridiculous thing off.

411
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,359
Make me.

412
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,461
Ow, stop it,
cut it out, stop, ow!

413
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,629
[gasp]
wait a minute.

414
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,064
Ow!
Gimme that.

415
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,199
Okay, on my signal,
I'm gonna draw his fire.

416
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,802
You idiots make make a run
for it, find pam and a.J.,

417
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,871
And get them to safety
before the rest of these

418
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:40,972
Jerk-dicks get here.

419
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:41,973
What about cheryl?

420
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,141
Who cares?

421
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,744
No, I'm genuinely asking.

422
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,546
So while we're getting
a.J. Out of here,

423
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,814
What're you gonna be doing?

424
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,082
Krieger, the hvac ducts

425
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,750
Are still chock full
of nerve gas, right?

426
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,118
Wait, what?
Yeah, but--

427
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
But shut up,
just get a.J. Outta here,

428
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,555
I'll take care of the rest.

429
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,557
Archer, that's--
pretty heroic, I know.

430
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,160
I was gonna say overkill, but--
what're you, on their side?

431
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,662
That asshole
threatened to hurt a.J.

432
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,130
Although now that
I think about it,

433
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,999
This whole thing
is totally her fault.

434
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,668
What? As far as
field operations are concerned,

435
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,770
She's a huge
liability!

436
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,106
Now shut up
and wait for my signal.

437
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,443
[farooq]
reloading. I should probably
stop saying that out loud.

438
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,744
Should we just go now?

439
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,980
I mean, yeah you should have,

440
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,649
But it's probably
too late now, so...

441
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,086
Now!
[speaking urdu]

442
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,354
Quit saying that.

443
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,923
[yelling]

444
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,324
We should've gone then,
I bet.

445
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,260
[speaking urdu]

446
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,199
[chuckling]
where do you think
you're going?

447
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,834
Must...

448
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,436
Protect... Baby.

449
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,671
[slow clapping]

450
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,639
What the...?

451
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,975
Not bad.
I'm gonna give you a seven.

452
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,043
Wait, what?

453
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,378
Me, or him?

454
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,346
No him, slater said
you were great.

455
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,447
Aww, he's sweet.

456
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,849
You, I took off a point

457
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,551
Because pam was feeding
a.J. Vienna sausages.

458
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,321
Idiot!
She's not on solid food yet.

459
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,856
They weren't solid.

460
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,325
The fact that you were
pre-chewing them

461
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,860
And spitting them
into her mouth--

462
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,528
What the hell is going on?
[baby crying]

463
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,497
Shhhh.
What is wrong with you?

464
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,033
Well for starters,
I got shot. Twice.

465
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,534
Where did you get a real gun?

466
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,836
My cousin. The one you gave me
looked like, so fake,

467
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,638
And I thought a real one
would help me

468
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,906
Get into the character better.

469
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,042
Oh, give it a rest,
james lipton.

470
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,577
He's an actor?
Well, mostly improv, but--

471
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,813
You set this whole thing up?
You had me shot?

472
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,381
You had slater shot?

473
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,150
No, the cia guys
did his make-up.

474
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,418
Looked pretty real though, huh?

475
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,054
So cool.
Were you assholes in on this?

476
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,588
[denials]

477
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,924
Oh, please,
you can't tell them anything.

478
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,360
Why... Would you do this?

479
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,228
I wanted to see
if I could trust you

480
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,364
To take care of a.J.
By yourself.

481
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,534
Oh!
Yeah, let's talk about trust.

482
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,370
Oh, let's talk about drinking
a gallon of black mexicans

483
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,106
Before driving around in a car
with your infant daughter!

484
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,341
Good point
I was at gunpoint.

485
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,910
Also good.
[lana]
well...

486
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,945
You still lied when you said
you weren't gonna drink.

487
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,613
You knew I was lying.

488
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,917
That doesn't ex--
wait, that's your excuse?

489
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes! Lana.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

490
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,291
I am in fairly desperate need
of medical attention.

491
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,561
[baby cries]
all your fault!

492
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,130
God damn it!
Why are you going up?

493
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,465
All right, I'd call this...

494
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,867
A qualified success.

495
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,869
Yeah, I really feel like
I nailed it.

496
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,472
So... You do improv, huh?

497
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,474
Yeah, at dream
the improovable dream,

498
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,875
Down on twenty-third and lex.

499
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,611
You guys gotta come down,
maybe take a class,

500
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,214
It's good for confidence,
or just, at least come out
to a show...

501
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,982
Here's some flyers.

502
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,451
Our upcoming shows are on there,
plus there's a coupon

503
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,221
For a free drink
if you're a lady, so...

504
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,557
Wait, is it not
the imprahv-able dream?

505
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,162
Huh.
That makes way more sense.
