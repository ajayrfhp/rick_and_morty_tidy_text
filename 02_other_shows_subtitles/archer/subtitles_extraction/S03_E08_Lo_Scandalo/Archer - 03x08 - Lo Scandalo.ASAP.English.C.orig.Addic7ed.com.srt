1
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:20,774
WD-40, Mother.

2
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,196
Costs like, a nickel.

3
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:26,383
Or maybe you could swallow your pride
and just apologize to your super.

4
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,388
Oh, and to me, for ruining my Friday
night, which is now being spent here.

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,490
So what, why the frantic phone call?

6
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,459
Hello?

7
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,160
Malory? Why did you call us?

8
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,232
Because if it was -- oh.

9
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:43,204
I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume
it had something to do with that.

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,207
It's not what it looks like.

11
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,976
Oh, well that's a relief.

12
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:50,213
Because it looks like you're
sitting here with a gun.

13
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,851
And over there, strapped to
a chair and shot to death,

14
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,720
is a guy in a full-body latex catsuit!

15
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,390
Or am I misreading the situation?!

16
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,060
Well...
technically it's a zentai.

17
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:01,794
Wh-...?!

18
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,563
A zentai covers
the face and head.

19
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,902
- I think a catsuit just stops here...
- Give me that.

20
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,537
I didn't shoot him.

21
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,474
So, you're saying the fact that
your gun has recently been fired, is --

22
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:14,309
-- is unrelated to
the dead guy over there,

23
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,945
who's chock full of bullets!

24
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:19,183
- Well, obviously they're related...
- Yeah, do that,

25
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:19,917
take that tone.

26
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:22,254
But I swear,
I didn't shoot him!

27
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:22,922
Okay.

28
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,992
So I guess he walked in here already
shot, obviously panicking,

29
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,495
so you had to restrain him
with these leather cuffs,

30
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:31,265
and then to keep pressure on
the wounds you greased him up

31
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,168
- and squeezed him into this...
- Zentai!

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,604
And of course not, you ass!

33
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:38,073
Someone broke in here and shot him!

34
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,174
Okay, Malory?

35
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:42,243
Well, unless it was the
creepy-old people-bondage-sex police,

36
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:47,581
why would anyone break
in here and shoot him?!

37
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,816
No answer?

38
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,784
Okay, let's ask him!

39
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,486
Ho-lee shit.

40
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,789
Because he's Savio Mascalzone.

41
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,391
- Um...
- Oh for -- the prime minister of Italy?

42
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,525
The what?!

43
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,094
And wait, doesn't Italy use a king?

44
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:01,661
Wh-?

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,729
No, they don't "use a king!"

46
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,832
What year do you think this is?

47
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,768
I -- yeah,
exactly, good question.

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,006
- And uh, speaking of questions...
- No no no, don't --

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,810
what're you -- don't go back there, Sterling, I--
I have a question!

50
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:15,444
Mother!

51
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,515
Why does this chair have no seat!

52
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,651
And what!

53
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:26,625
Is in his ass?!

54
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:38,343
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

55
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,585
Mother!

56
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,605
What is in this man's ass?!

57
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:10,109
Oh please, don't act like you've
never seen a... "marital aid" before.

58
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,579
Not in a dead
prime minister's ass!

59
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,147
And you don't have
to keep repeating it!

60
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:16,216
We've established where it is!

61
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,718
Yeah so, you
wanna move on to why?

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,752
Wait, not why that!

63
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:21,988
Why he's here!

64
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,758
Savio and I met after the war,
when I was in Italy with Gladio.

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,459
Who's that, his brother?!

66
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,227
No, it --
Ewwwww!

67
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,962
Are you finished?

68
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,898
Hang on, ew, now I'm done.

69
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,066
Operation Gladio.

70
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:39,570
It was a NATO stay-behind mission, set
up to counter a possible Soviet invasion

71
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:40,671
of Western Europe.

72
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:44,908
But then it sort of turned into
this whole weird cryptofascist CIA

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,211
shitshow, starring Allen Dulles
and a bunch of former Nazis.

74
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,347
Thanks, Holly Hindsight.

75
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,719
Anyway, Savio was in Italian intelligence--
Rimshot.

76
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,122
-- shut up, and we were
working all these late nights,

77
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,925
there was a mutual attraction,
one thing led to another...

78
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,228
- Please skip ahead...
- And then he got married

79
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,729
and went into politics.

80
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,232
But ever since then, once a
year he'd slip away and

81
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,568
we'd spend a romantic weekend together.

82
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,103
Well, you nailed it!

83
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:13,572
I mean, if this doesn't
just scream romance...!

84
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,873
- Archer...
- What, Lana?!

85
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,475
What's more romantic than a
dildo-party-slash-murder?!

86
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:21,011
A murder I'm trying to get a handle
on, so could you shut up a second?!

87
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:22,746
And he wasn't always into that!

88
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,181
You mean vice versa?

89
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,549
Shut up!

90
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:30,487
As he grew older, Savio's tastes
became more and more... exotic.

91
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:35,426
And so he started introducing all these...
accoutrements very gradually.

92
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:36,495
Well, he'd have to.

93
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:37,662
Thing's huge.

94
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,697
Ow! Ow!

95
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,901
Okay, okay, I -- okay!
God, your hands are like cricket bats.

96
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:43,702
Shut up.

97
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:45,938
So Malory, what happened, can
you walk us through the crime?

98
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,942
Just the crime of murder, not
the crime of sodomy-by-rubber-eggplant.

99
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,444
Savio was in town
to give a speech at the UN.

100
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,614
We'd made plans to meet here, so
he gave his handlers the slip

101
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:58,717
and arrived here at about... seven.

102
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,887
We caught up over a
glass or two of champagne.

103
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,025
Then I freshened up while Savio
got changed and... situated.

104
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:11,697
- So he put the, uh, in his own...
- Yes, hush.

105
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,368
I came out of the bedroom...
Savio, sei pronto?

106
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,171
Si, cara mia, molto pronto!

107
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:21,975
I crossed over to the chair,
and tightened his last restraint...

108
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:23,243
Oho!

109
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,412
Mi fai pazzo con libido!

110
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:30,518
Then I went to refill my champagne--
Savio loved to be kept waiting --

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,753
and then bang!

112
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,722
In burst three men!

113
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:34,856
Aaaaaghh! Oof!

114
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:35,857
Che cosa?!

115
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,793
Cara mia, che --
Savio!

116
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,662
Andiamo! Subito!

117
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:44,299
Wait, whoa, whoa, back up--
Why did you have a gun?!

118
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:49,337
Hm? Oh, well, Savio liked
it to seem a little... dangerous.

119
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:49,804
You know?

120
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:50,672
No, Mother, I don't!

121
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,640
Jesus, what else was
on tonight's menu?!

122
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,909
Sex under a hive of Africanized bees?!

123
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,277
Archer!

124
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,814
- So, you fired three times...
- And missed!

125
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:01,082
Can you believe it?

126
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:01,816
No.

127
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:04,585
Oh, sorry, was that rhetorical?

128
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,054
Lawyer up, call the cops.

129
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,322
What?!

130
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:10,825
Oh, and hit the throttle on the
bourbon, because I'm gonna have to...

131
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,493
I'm gonna have to bust you
in the face a couple times.

132
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:13,995
What are you talking about?!

133
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:14,796
Self-defense!

134
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:15,964
It's your only shot!

135
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:19,068
We gotta uncuff him and...
de-dildo him, obviously.

136
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,305
Smash the furniture like he was
chasing you around all rapey,

137
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:26,009
fortunately he's Italian so that
shouldn't be too hard a sell, then --

138
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,277
I! Didn't! Shoot him!

139
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,347
On purpose, exactly,
the gun just went off.

140
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,317
But you probably wanna play
that a lot softer with a jury.

141
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,318
A jury?!

142
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,919
When you don't believe me?!

143
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,455
Mother, come on, I
mean I want to believe you...

144
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:42,059
But those bullet holes don't
prove anyone else was ever here.

145
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:46,731
- Well, maybe those don't...
- Puttana!

146
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:47,665
Ungh!

147
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,399
What?!

148
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:49,967
You got -- Malory, you got shot!

149
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,736
Yes, I know dear, I was there.

150
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:53,271
Well, lemme see,
take off your coat!

151
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,006
No! I'm fine, it's
just a through-and-through.

152
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,508
Mother! Malory!

153
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,943
What, I put Bactine on it!

154
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:58,710
Mother!

155
00:06:58,712 --> 00:06:59,411
Sterling!

156
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:02,515
The Italian prime minister was
just assassinated in my apartment!

157
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:05,151
And so I think an apology is in order!

158
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:07,354
Thanks, I know
that's hard for you.

159
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:07,787
Wh-?

160
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,857
You two owe me an apology!

161
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:10,591
For what?!

162
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:11,759
Not believing me!

163
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,628
How about for you
dragging us into your S&M--

164
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,097
dildo-sex-murder freak show?!

165
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,199
I -- look --
You look!

166
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:22,069
I bet I'll never be able to have sex
again without thinking about this!

167
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,305
I bet I won't even be able to
eat spaghetti and meatballs!

168
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,106
Oh my God.

169
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,107
What? What?

170
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,509
I could eat.

171
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,344
I mean, not necessarily spaghetti
and meatballs, but...

172
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:34,639
Not necessarily not
spaghetti and meatballs.

173
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,486
I mean I really like
spaghetti and meatballs.

174
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,934
Man if I don't get some spaghetti
and meatballs, I may literally die.

175
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,896
- Oh, and thanks so much...
- You're welcome.

176
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,899
But you should wait'll you try it,
I'm just kinda winging it here.

177
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,069
I meant for
dragging me into this.

178
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,404
Still welcome.

179
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:52,904
So.

180
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,540
We've got dead Italian prime minister
in the living room, which --

181
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,409
Sucks, I bet he
knew how to make sauce.

182
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,411
Which will be hard to explain.

183
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:03,015
Especially given the circumstances
leading up to his death, which were --

184
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:03,816
Dildoey.

185
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,784
Unseemly!

186
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:09,188
- Potato podildo...
- So "plausible deniability"

187
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,291
isn't a super-realistic goal here.

188
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,193
So we need to sneak
the body out somehow.

189
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:15,896
Sure, we'll just walk a
dead body right out the front door!

190
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:16,763
Idiot!

191
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:17,531
What, then?!

192
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,632
Burn the apartment down?!

193
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:21,268
We're not burning
down my apartment!

194
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,902
You sure?

195
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,804
Shut up, I hit
broil instead of bake.

196
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:25,673
Well, blood loss
can make you stupid.

197
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,542
Can I please look at your wound?

198
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,042
No!

199
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:30,712
Nor can you burn down my apartment,
so think of something else.

200
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:33,115
I shall fetch a rug!

201
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:33,916
Something else!

202
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,785
You're not rolling him
up in one of my rugs!

203
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:37,452
Why not?

204
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,754
Because then what?!

205
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,889
We...
get some coveralls, and a van.

206
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,858
Like a carpet cleaning van, and just
walk him right out the front door.

207
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,493
You just called
me an idiot for that!

208
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:48,295
Your version
didn't have coveralls.

209
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,764
Could we go out
through the basement?

210
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:51,165
No.

211
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,467
We'd have to go past the super's
apartment, and his door is always open.

212
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,539
I assume to let the stink of cabbage
waft through the halls, but --

213
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,508
So? You think he'd be a problem?

214
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,275
God, yes.

215
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:05,947
- We're not on the best of terms...
- It's just, at Christmas,

216
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:09,585
the tenants usually gimme a small
consideration, for the work I do all yeer

217
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:10,553
keepin up the bildin.

218
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,355
We surely count on it, ma'am.

219
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:15,625
Specially this yeer, as we had
more'n the usual medical bills.

220
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,027
Your point being?

221
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,131
Just that, fer the tird year runnin...
Ya gimme a potato.

222
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,634
Oh dear, so once again
you're faced with the classic

223
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,269
"Irishman's Dilemma."

224
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,943
Do I eat the potato now, or let it
ferment, so I can drink it later?

225
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,911
Will I get
the operation now, Da?

226
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,981
No son... yer gonnaa die.

227
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,616
What is your
problem with the Irish?

228
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:43,020
You mean besides not being
on our side in World War Two?

229
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:44,988
Yeah, besides that.

230
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,989
Wait, seriously?

231
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,124
They were Nazis?!

232
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:47,825
No.

233
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,827
- Not Japanese...
- Neutral!

234
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,563
And now, since I don't wanna be
an accessory after the fact,

235
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:55,733
how's about we figure out a way to get
that body out of the damn apartment?!

236
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,835
Where'd we land
on the coveralls thing?

237
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:58,269
Archer?

238
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,171
Because I don't even
know where we'd get coveralls

239
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:04,708
this time of night, so --
Soooo... if we can't get the body out of

240
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,510
- here in one piece...
- Nooope!

241
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,077
What?

242
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,345
Lana, it's the only way.

243
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,179
What is?

244
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:13,850
No! Malory, I've done some messed
up shit working for you, but I am not,

245
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:16,219
repeat not, chopping up a dead body!

246
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,419
Oh. Ewww! Mother!

247
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:19,955
What! My God, do you want
me to get the electric chair?!

248
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,191
For a murder you both
know I didn't commit?!

249
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,759
Malory, I just can't.

250
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,627
Me neither.

251
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:25,594
Can't?

252
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:26,529
Or won't.

253
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:30,599
I --
Whatever, call it her can't, me won't.

254
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,469
No, hey, Mother, c'mon.

255
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,805
Stop that!

256
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:36,839
Here, here, look!

257
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,174
I'm gonna get help!

258
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:41,477
From, from who-hoo-hoooo?!

259
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:45,314
I need access to a two-inch
drain, hot water, three GFCI outlets,

260
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:49,385
this bathroom should do nicely, and a pot
of coffee, just like I like my women:

261
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:52,188
black, bitter, preferably fair trade.

262
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,423
Oh, and your sauce needs less salt.

263
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,992
- How can you --
- Put two halves of a potato in with the sauce,

264
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,060
it'll absorb the salt.

265
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,029
Oh, and I assume that's our patient?

266
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,364
Not ours, Krieger.

267
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:03,332
Yours.

268
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,767
Thank you.

269
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,002
Ugh, too salty.

270
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,437
Yeah, you got a potato?

271
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,472
What is this, Christmas?

272
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:11,641
And is Krieger... hard at work?

273
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,277
He literally might be, yeah.

274
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:14,845
Ew.

275
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,347
Well, say what you will about him--
I did.

276
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:18,248
he's discreet.

277
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,118
So no one else will ever know about this whole--
Aaaaaaaaaghhhh!

278
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,320
What in the--
Hell is that?!

279
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,489
Hopefully my
greatest work yet.

280
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,925
No no no no no!

281
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,727
Whatever this is, I am not
getting mixed up in it!

282
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:31,762
Too late.

283
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:34,832
Hey whoa, whoa,
everybody calm down!

284
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:35,766
It's not what it looks like!

285
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,434
Well, then,
what is it, exactly?!

286
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:40,705
'Cause it sure as shit ain't
a surprise party, Krieger!

287
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:41,439
Ya big fat liar!

288
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:43,975
Someone's trying to frame
Malory for murdering the prime

289
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:44,876
minister of Italy.

290
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,845
I bet
it's that wicked king!

291
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:47,378
So?!

292
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,946
Why'd Krieger drag us into it?!

293
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes, Krieger!

294
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:50,714
Why?!

295
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,417
I needed help...
disseminating him.

296
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,751
Ewww!

297
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:55,552
Not what it means.

298
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,488
But it's still
pretty gross though.

299
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,355
And brilliant!

300
00:11:58,357 --> 00:12:00,224
When I'm done, each one of us
will walk out the front door

301
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,226
- carrying a small parcel...
- How small?!

302
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:02,926
Eh.

303
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,028
Then on our way home, we
simply drop the parcels into

304
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,064
seven different trash cans
in three different boroughs.

305
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,233
That's... actually pretty smart.

306
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,835
And hopefully,
when you look at all the

307
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:15,806
different drop points on a map,
it'll look like a big smiley face.

308
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,108
That's actually pretty gross.

309
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,511
Kind of clever.

310
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:22,879
Every time!

311
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:26,916
Every single time we come over here,
we have to help you get rid of

312
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,550
a dead body!

313
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,985
Well, you've
only been here twice.

314
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:32,854
Speaking of, why the hell
was the prime minister of Italy here?

315
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:33,789
Don't ask.

316
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,125
And follow up, did those
dastardly dagoes kill

317
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,061
him and then dress him up like
a big giant penis, or --

318
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,896
Oh God, that reminds me.

319
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:41,430
Krieger?

320
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,665
Yeah, I found it!

321
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:43,299
Found what?

322
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,434
Don't ask.

323
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:45,134
Can I keep it?

324
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:45,902
Keep what?

325
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:46,603
Don't ask!

326
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,605
Just get it
out of here, please!

327
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,342
- Yeah, take that tone...
- I'd like to know this

328
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,210
could possibly get any worse.

329
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:56,547
Well, for one thing, there's
not enough sauce for everybody.

330
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:57,714
NYPD!

331
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:58,749
Open up, please?

332
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,251
Jeez it! It's the cops!
Oh. Busted.

333
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:03,586
And-or the
police could show up.

334
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,388
Oh for the --
now what do we do?!

335
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,841
Cover your arm up,
answer the door, and stall them.

336
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,805
And then. Somebody get me a Number 10
can of tomatoes.

337
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,247
What?

338
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,941
Sorry. Not enough sauce.

339
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,215
NYPD!

340
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:18,540
C'mon lady, open the door!

341
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,574
Comiiing!

342
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:26,983
Sorry, I was in the-- kitchen,
I'm making spaghetti and --meatballs.

343
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,018
Hi, I'm --
Italian, huh?

344
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,353
That's a coincidence.

345
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,988
Oh, are you
Italian, Officer...?

346
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,057
No, and it's Detective.
Murphy.

347
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,088
Irish.

348
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:35,859
That's right.

349
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:39,050
But we got an anonymous tip that
Savio Mascalzone was up here.

350
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,445
Oooh, who's that, some mobster?

351
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:43,628
Prime minister.
Of Italy.

352
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,066
Doesn't Italy use a king?

353
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,467
I wouldn't know.

354
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:47,368
Somebody dead?

355
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,770
What? Oh!

356
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:49,604
My bird.

357
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,705
Little Tweetsie.

358
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:51,473
Uh-huh.

359
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:54,376
Well, that's another coincidence,
'cause this anonymous tip said

360
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,944
Mascalzone was dead up here.

361
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:56,678
What?

362
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,413
Oh, for heaven's sake!

363
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,915
Yeah, right
here in the living room.

364
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:04,520
Well, as you can see, there
hasn't been a murder in here, my gosh!

365
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:07,022
Although I guess someone
must've spilled a drink.

366
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,758
I have a few dear friends
over for a dinner party.

367
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,692
Uh-huh.

368
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:11,793
Mind if I talk to them?

369
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:15,063
Heavens, no, of course not, but--
What's in here?

370
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:15,998
Bathroom?

371
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,032
Uh-huh.

372
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:21,236
My guests are in here, Detective, but--
What are you doing--

373
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:23,805
from the left, dear,
one serves from the left!

374
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,809
What's gotten
into you, Calpurnia?!

375
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,010
My mistake, ma'am.

376
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:31,380
Well, I should
say it is, Calpurnia!

377
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:34,383
Muthah, your maid is -- oh, hello!

378
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,017
Evening.

379
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,187
- Sorry to disturb your, uh...
- Elegant dinnah pahty,

380
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,193
for the most elegant
people in all of New Yawk.

381
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:43,993
Uh-huh.

382
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:45,862
But we got a tip there'd
been a murder up here.

383
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,298
Good heavens, a murder?

384
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,403
Well, apart from this sullen wench
murdering good etiquette, owww!

385
00:14:53,405 --> 00:15:00,978
I find the very suggestion laughable.

386
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,713
So, you don't
mind if I look around?

387
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:03,947
Uh, no!

388
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:05,449
Of course not!

389
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,350
Calpurnia?

390
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,552
May I speak with you in the kitchen?

391
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,453
Certainly.

392
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:14,023
And I'll let you get back to your--
Elegant

393
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:17,594
dinnah pahty!

394
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:20,597
I hate you all so much.

395
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:26,337
No one cares, Figgis, you were
only invited to round out the numbahs.

396
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,713
What, how is this my fault?!

397
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,817
Gee, where to start...
oh! The murder?

398
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,220
Oh, I thought you meant
that silly French maid costume.

399
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,622
Which makes you look ridiculous.

400
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,959
And why do you even - never
mind, I don't even wanna know.

401
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,295
Good, it's
none of your beeswax.

402
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:49,862
Here.

403
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,564
I hope you won't need it, but--
Why would I need...?

404
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:55,134
- Oh, huh-uh, noop.
- Lana!

405
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,568
Malory! I am not!

406
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,305
Killing a--
A perfectly nice dinnah, Calpurnia!

407
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:04,342
By God, if you were my servant, I'd
have you over my knee in a trice!

408
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:06,844
And Muthah, the constable
wishes a word.

409
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:07,711
He does?

410
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:08,779
I mean yes?

411
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,614
Yeah, sorry
for the intrusion.

412
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:11,715
That tip musta been a hoax.

413
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,249
I checked out the whole
apartment, it's clean.

414
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,018
- No thanks to this one...
- Mmmm...?!

415
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,752
Sullen wench.

416
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:19,055
I mean indubitably Lieutenant.

417
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:22,625
So then I'll,
uh, just be on my way.

418
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,929
It's just, who would call in with a
fake tip like that, though, ya know?

419
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,065
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was our super, Mr. Herlihy.

420
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:29,899
He drinks.

421
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,637
Thanks, I'll check on --
oh hey, I never checked this bathroom.

422
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,037
Ya mind?

423
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,172
I -- no, of course not.

424
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,576
Be my guest.

425
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:49,451
Whew! Oh!
Sorry, didn't know anyone was waiting.

426
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:52,653
But I'd recommend the other bathroom,
I mean I did what I could,

427
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:55,322
but you can only ask so
much of a vanilla candle.

428
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:56,757
Dinner ready?

429
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,693
- My God...
- Ugh! Yeah, he really did a number on it.

430
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,762
Might wanna make sure he didn't
leave ya an upper decker.

431
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:04,731
Sorry again for the intrusion, ma'am.

432
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,601
And Herlihy, you said his name was?

433
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:08,469
Hm? Oh, yes.

434
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,438
Yes, that's right.

435
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,172
Ow! Ow!

436
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:12,374
Lana, c'mon, I was -- ow!

437
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,476
I'll show you a sullen wench!

438
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,578
Right then.

439
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,082
That snoopy detective is gone,
thanks to Dr. Krieger, so --

440
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:20,783
Krieger?

441
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:21,617
What about the rest of us?

442
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,621
The rest of you can get out of
my clothes, and then out of my house.

443
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:29,424
But thank you all so much for coming!

444
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,325
Loved it.

445
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,092
Never, never again.

446
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,594
Thanks
for dead guy in a box.

447
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:33,328
Not very elegant.

448
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,396
Oh no, thanks
for having us, amazing.

449
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:38,499
And remember, smiley face!
And thank you.

450
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,466
Krieger, wait.

451
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:42,136
The bathroom, the body, how did you...?

452
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:44,671
Shhhhh!
Shh shh shh shh shhhhhhh.

453
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:46,040
You don't wanna know.

454
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,976
But you do probably wanna
wash your lips now.

455
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:51,612
Ugh.

456
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,247
Screw you, Archer!

457
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,248
Sullen wench?!

458
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,748
Lana!

459
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,916
C'mon, I was just kidding!

460
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,184
I had to make it look good!

461
00:17:57,186 --> 00:18:00,654
- You had to make it look good...
- Well, and also annoy you.

462
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,823
Walther PP, chambered
for thirty-two ACP.

463
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,592
What's the magazine capacity?

464
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:05,593
Uh..gh. Eight.

465
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:06,361
Eight rounds.

466
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:07,729
Plus one in the chamber.

467
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,598
For a total... of nine.

468
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,166
Hey thanks, Rainman.

469
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:11,933
Your point being?

470
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:13,435
Malory's clip was empty.

471
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,871
But she said she only
fired three shots.

472
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:20,609
Oh my God, so you're saying
Mother lured Mascalzone up there...

473
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:24,579
Greased him into a six-foot manrubber,
strapped him to a chair...

474
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,513
Sei pronto?

475
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:28,216
Si, cara mia,
sono molto pronto!

476
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:29,884
Bene. Anch'io.

477
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,118
Oho!

478
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,353
Mi fai pazzo con libido!

479
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,321
I know dear.

480
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,488
But you have to wait.

481
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,824
Calls us... What?

482
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,327
Mother calm -- I'm on my way!

483
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,027
Don't move.

484
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,496
I'll probably be back.

485
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,733
Then she pulls a gun on him?!

486
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:46,667
Che cosa?!

487
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:47,468
What is this?!

488
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,469
A crock of shit!

489
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,205
Because that would mean she
called the cops on herself!

490
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,275
Knowing they'd never come back
after they searched her apartment.

491
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,645
Which was full of people, and spotless.

492
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,282
Oh my God, do
the math, Rainman!

493
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:07,124
The wall was shot three times...
Mascalzone was shot five times!

494
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,993
For a total, wait for it, of eight!

495
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:10,694
Yeah.

496
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:11,728
Plus the one in her arm.

497
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,262
Wh-?!

498
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:14,364
So what, Mother shot herself?!

499
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:15,932
Oh my God!

500
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,534
Ungh!

501
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,968
Mio dio! Perche?!

502
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,736
Why?

503
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,504
I'll tell you exactly why.

504
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,272
Before I kill you.

505
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,506
Operation Gladio.

506
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,608
Gladio?!

507
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,878
Which would mean Mother's been
banging him once a year for like

508
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,517
thirty-five years, and the whole
time she's been holding a grudge,

509
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,553
just waiting to... Holy shit.

510
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:40,354
She killed him.

511
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,589
And got us to
dispose of the body.

512
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:43,991
Ugh. But why?

513
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:45,092
After all this time?

514
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:48,229
Well, to be honest, until
recently the sex has been

515
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,930
pretty phenomenal --
Grazie.

516
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,099
And I figured,
eh, what's the hurry?

517
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:55,036
But then you started getting... weird.

518
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,971
But why
you make la vendetta?

519
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:59,741
Because one night, all
those years ago in Rome,

520
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:03,779
you and your fascist thugs gunned
down a young man in the street.

521
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:04,680
A beautiful man.

522
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:08,851
- Blue eyes, full lips, black thick wavy hair...
- Perche?

523
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:09,953
What was his crime?

524
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:13,223
Well, I wouldn't call speaking
out against the rebirtof fascism

525
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,592
a crime.

526
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,127
More of a mistake.

527
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:19,130
By a beautiful, idealistic young man.

528
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:21,165
Who may have beenee my son's father.

529
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,766
May have been?!

530
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,201
You don't know?!

531
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:24,835
Madon'!

532
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,237
Che tipo di puttana sei?!

533
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:31,107
Che tipo davvero.

534
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,608
Cazzo fascista.

535
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,842
Who knows, it's Malory.

536
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:35,811
You really wanna know
why she killed a guy?

537
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:38,079
I... do not, no.

538
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,883
Although... I am curious why she
wouldn't take off that trenchcoat.

539
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:42,851
Mm!

540
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,987
Honey, you still got it.

541
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:46,755
Bow chicka bow bow!

542
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:47,690
Uh huh huh!

543
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:51,595
So much of this I never
wanna know the answer to.

544
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:54,097
Okay, how 'bout a slice?

545
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,842
God, what's with me and Italian lately?

546
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:08,203
