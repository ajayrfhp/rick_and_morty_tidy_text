1
00:00:01,176 --> 00:00:02,499
[Archer]
Because she's two, Lana!

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:03,952
What possible difference
could it make,

3
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:06,171
what pre-pre-school
she goes to?

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,990
Because if A.J. gets
into pre-pre at Country Day,

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,409
she's set through eighth grade.

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,811
Then she's basically
guaranteed a slot

7
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,245
at any prep school in L.A.!

8
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,714
Yeah, but why prep school?

9
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,282
Are we not even
considering public school?

10
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,484
Seriously?

11
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,285
Why not?
And in summertime,

12
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:20,953
instead of a lemonade stand,

13
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,422
she could have a teeny little
stripper pole, and--

14
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:24,291
Malory!
Mother!

15
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:25,878
Public school.

16
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,313
Might as well leave her by a
dumpster at the county fair

17
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:29,948
and hope she's taken in by carnies.

18
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,850
Wow.
Yeah, Mother, good call,

19
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:33,293
I didn't know we were drinking.

20
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,953
We're not.
Because Country Day

21
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:38,190
gets a thousand applicants
for ten spaces in pre-pre.

22
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:40,459
Please stop saying "pre-pre."
Shut up.

23
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,461
And A.J. is going to get
one of those spaces,

24
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,897
and you're not gonna screw
this up for her, Archer!

And, Archer, you're in L.A.?
What's your line?

00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:48,727
This is our daughter, A.J.

55
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,327
We're here for a placement interview.

Gosh, the times we live in, huh?

So hey, private investigator.

I might actually be able to use you.

Oh, well...
Really?

64

Unfortunately, I don't think

we're taking on new clients
right now, so-- [chuckles]

clients" bullshit?

He's on the board, Archer.
One word from him, and A.J. is in.

Yeah, but--
Yeah, but shut up!

This is your daughter's future,
you dickhead!

and A.J.
is going to school here

to be a titan of industry

How we always used

160
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,726
At first I thought--

161
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,591
but...

162
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,277
What about good old pills and vodka?

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,379

on a suicide,

wife out of ten million dollars.

00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,718
No, I guess they--
but I can't, um--

166
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,454
You can, though.
Please, I'm begging you,

167
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:43,856
don't make me go through that.

168
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:45,390
Can't you go
to Switzerland, or--

169
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,858
No, no, but you can.

170
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,360
You can open a Swiss account

171
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,082
with the $100,000
I'm going to pay you.

174
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,535
a space at Country Day for his...

175
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:58,870

[clears throat] I think technically
she's an octoroon bastard,

177
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,843

philosophy is sort of, uh,

182
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:14,886
I assume you have access
to a firearm?

183
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,823
I do, yeah-- But you can't
shoot me in the face.

184
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,524
Or the belly.
Or in the legs.

185
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:21,293
Why would I shoot you in the legs?

186
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:22,961
Well I just don't want to suffer.

187
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:24,363
That's kind of the whole point.

188
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,164
We could do two
in the back of the head:

189
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,606
That's painless, instantaneous.

190
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,701
Have you...
killed people before?

191
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:32,170
Uh, yeah.
Literally scores of them.

192
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:35,507

Okay, let's do this.

00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,686
Tonight.
Wait, when? What?

197
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,021
Tonight. Why wait?
I'll be home alone,

198
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:51,424
and it's the maid's night off.

199
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,858
My wife will be at a fundraiser.

Kids?

Do you have children?

202
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,396
Oh, no. Just a bedroom safe,

203
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,079
which I will conveniently leave open,

204
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,901
and in which will be $100,000.

205
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,237
And a letter of recommendation
for Abbiejean...

I'll leave the name blank.

[scoffs] Yeah, I should
probably know that...

208
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,179

Okay, so where and when?

Well he's paying
me a hundred--

314
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:57,316
dammit-- and fifty
thousand dollars, so--

315
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:58,617
[Cyril] Ahaa!
[both] What?

316
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,686
Ten thousand, my butt!
I knew it!

317
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,688
Are you-- Cyril,
you followed me?

318
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,023
You lied to me!

319
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,824
Yeah, but you didn't know that.

320
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,360
On some level, I think we both did.

321
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:13,065
Hello, Cyril Figgis, owner and lead
investigator of The Figgis Agency.

322
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,200
How's it going? Trent
Whitney, murder victim.

323
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,735
Would-be murder victim!

324
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:18,337
I'm sorry,
what-what's happening?

325
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,572
My partner paid him to kill me.

326
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:23,545
He what? You what? Under
false pretenses, Cyril!

327
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,817
Calm down, I thought
I was killing the other guy.

328
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,564
Why were you killing anybody?

329
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,397
Because I thought he had cancer.

330
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,749
And also in prep school

331
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:33,052
both of them bullied the
absolute shit out of me.

332
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:36,522
[laughing]
What? Seriously, dude?

333
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:40,125
You were going to murder me 'cause
I picked on you a little bit?

334
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,894
A little?
You almost killed me!

335
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:44,196
I spent freshman year
in the hospital!

336
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:45,764
With what, AIDS?
[chuckles]

337
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,101
Pneumonia!
From what, complications from AI-- Ow!

338
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:51,103
Jesus Christ.
And if I'm being honest, yeah,

339
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,572
I'm sure the bullying had some
influence on my decision,

340
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:57,309
but I was actually murdering
you-- well, Ivy-- for money.

341
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:58,511
And that makes it better?

342
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,246
Money and cancer,
then! Jesus!

343
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,650
But don't tell me you never fantasized
about killing your bullies, Cyril.

344
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:08,754
[Archer, crying]
Cyril?

345
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,690
Cyril!

346
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,526
It puts the lotion in the basket!

347
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,894
[Archer] What? What?

348
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,763
What're we doing?
Um, I think Whitney

349
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,631
was about to pay me $300,000?

350
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,800
Not to kill him?
That's extortion!

351
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,903
I know, Cyril, but think of the
alternative. His hands are tied.

352
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:27,239
And yes, yes, dude, I will pay you,

353
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,743
but the money's not in my house.
It's, it's, it's--

354
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,785
[impersonating Jimmy Stewart] It's in
Tom's house, and-and Bill's house.

355
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,714
And and and and and and and!

356
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,549
Okay, okay, wait, wait!
[keypad pressing]

357
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:42,054
Dude, check this out. What if I
paid you 500, and you kill Ivy?

358
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,223
Mmm, no, I think just the three.

359
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,992
Ivy's a cuckold, betrayed
by his wife and friend.

360
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:50,262
You're a cuckolding thief, and
between us, clearly an alcoholic.

361
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:52,331
He's an alcoholic.
He didn't know

362
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:55,000
he was gonna die tonight, Cyril.
For him it's just Tuesday.

363
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,870
Anyway, you're both so obviously
and profoundly unhappy

364
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,152
with who you became, that
I bet you're both gonna die

365
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,874
in some bizarre
murder-suicide,

366
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,809
and that is reward enough for me.

367
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,311
Yeah. That and $300,000.

368
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:10,082
Yeah. [sighs] Well, you
may be right about that.

369
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,384
But I'll tell you this, Swirling.

370
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:16,655
I shoulda drowned you in piss when
I had the chance, you little fa--

371
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,090
[blood splatters]
[yelps]

372
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,125
Huh.
Jeezy Petes!

373
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:23,262
Great shot, Archer.
[scoffs] Yeah, right?

374
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,631
But as much as I'd like to
take credit for that...

375
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,865
Ahh!
Yeah, right?

376
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,001
Ahh.
Oof.

377
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:30,469
Who the heck is shooting at us?

378
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:31,837
[chuckling]
Cyril, c'mon.

379
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,172
It's obviously Ivy.

380
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:37,676
C'mon, Swirling, where are you?

381
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:39,311
I bet this was his plan all along.

382
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,856
He follows me,
I kill Whitney, he kills me,

383
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,002
looks like a robbery.
But I thought he had cancer.

384
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:46,634
No, dummy, that was just a ruse.

385
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,353
But either way, when I had cancer,

386
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,222
I bet I killed, like, 20 guys,

387
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,825
so it's not a death sentence
anymore, is my point.

388
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:54,193
No, but this is!

389
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,994
Yeah, he almost made the Olympics.

390
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,863
What?
Biathlon, I know,

391
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,432
you think to yourself
"Pretty gay sport," but--

392
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:02,634
Holy shit!
What?

393
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,670
You think he knows Ray?

394
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,259
Cyril, stop it!
I mean it, hang up!

395
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:17,095
Gimme, Cyril. Dammit! Get off.
Stop it! Archer!

396
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:18,997
<i>[Lana] This is Lana Kane.
Leave a message.</i>

397
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,265
[beep] Lana! Lana, we're--

398
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,667
We're fine.
Everything's great.

399
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,268
Bye, hon.
Oww!

400
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,802
Jeezy Petes!
See?

401
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,204
I told you not to call her.

402
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:27,872
Well, we can't call the police.

403
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,908
No, uh, this does not look good.

404
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,310
Wonder why she didn't pick up.

405
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:32,644
[Lana]
I can explain.

406
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:34,712
What, why you're stalking this guy?

407
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:37,165
Stalking?
It's just hamentashen!

408
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:38,883
Okay. You wanna
explain this?

409
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,085
[sigh] You got a license for that?

410
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,221
Well, I'm a private investigator,
so-- [officer laughs]

411
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:44,989
Got a license for that? [laughs]

412
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:47,992
Well, not, um, you know,
technically, but-- No.

413
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,429
All you got is baby pictures,
a Sub Club card and...

414
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:54,933
what appears to be a very
crudely-drawn "vagina pass."

415
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:56,534
[groans]

416
00:16:56,736 --> 00:16:59,370
Okay, so call Ray, on your cell!

417
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:00,905
I can't.
Why not?

418
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,885
After the whole biker
voicemail fiasco...

419
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:05,545
Mother took it away.
What?

420
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,424
What are you, 9 years... Ow!

421
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,396
Haha! Ow!
Haha! Ow!

422
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,516
Shut up! And then you call Ray.

423
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,151
Cyril, why aren't you calling Ray?

424
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,587
Because I don't have a mobile carrier.
Why not?

425
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,690
I've been comparison shopping
for the best rate plan.

426
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:21,192
For three months? There are
literally two companies!

427
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,228
What the hell can
you possibly be comparing?

428
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,550
Their respective rate plans!

429
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:26,931
Wow. Okay, so if we
live through this,

430
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,434
which I wouldn't bet
on, I-- Wait, shut up!

431
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:30,902
[sniffs]
Do you smell that?

432
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:32,537
Oh, my God, did you shit yourself?

433
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,439
No, that!
[sniffs]

434
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,975
Oh that. Yeah, that's gas. What?

435
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,377
A round must've clipped
the gas line to the stove.

436
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,279
Oh my God.
Yeah, not great.

437
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,481
Even a tiny spark--

438
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,383
And we're dead.

439
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,418
So while you're getting the
money out of the safe-- What?

440
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:48,786
No, nuh-uh! There's
nothing between

441
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,389
the safe and the bullets! [gun fires]

442
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,257
There's me.
I'm gonna draw his fire.

443
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm gonna make a run for the car.
Meanwhile, you clear out the safe!

444
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,363
Okay, but-- Wait, what's to keep
you from just leaving me here?

445
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,098
Wha-- The money,
you idiot!

446
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,734
Oh right, that makes-- What?
One, two, three, go!

447
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,869
[yelling]

448
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,739
Ahh.
[gun firing]

449
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,808
Seriously.
That must be so sticky.

450
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,544
Son of a-- Can't have anything nice.
[car revs]

451
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:14,879
Cyril, let's go!

452
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,281
Hang on! There's--

453
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,750
Cyril! I swear to God
I will leave you!

454
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:21,085
[car revs]
Ah. Ooh.

455
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:24,922
[yelps]
Archer, wait!

456
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,658
[groans]

457
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,459
Oh, good.
You made it.

458
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:31,596
[tires screeching] In
the-- In the safe he had

459
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,798
all this stuff
from-- from--

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,033
[frustrated groan]

461
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,369
Holy shit!
Jeezy Petes!

462
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,506
Dammit! Should've gone
to the owl thing.

463
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,790
[Archer]
What?

464
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,175
[tires screeching]

465
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,443
Longwater!
Just like the--

466
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,925
The Veronica Deane case, I know.

467
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,279
What the hell was in the safe?

468
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:50,214
Files, disks, all kinds of stuff!

469
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,483
And you just left it?
You left me!

470
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,819
No, I merely tried to!

471
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,222
Hey, Swirling!

472
00:18:58,425 --> 00:18:59,991
Wow, think of how good
you'd have to be

473
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,626
to make the Olympic--
What the?

474
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:02,828
Cyril, what're you--

475
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:06,431
Suppressing fire!

476
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,665
[firing blanks]

477
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,001
[chuckles]

478
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:13,371
So, do you have more bullets, or...
[gun fires]

479
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,040
No.
Oof!

480
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,680
Cyril, I am so mad at you right
now, my mouth tastes like copper.

481
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,983
Well, but are you actually mad at me,

482
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,103
Yes!
or...

483
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:26,800
- the bullies who tormented a scrawny
teenage boy with no friends? - You!

484
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,087
Because I find it interesting
that you were bullied in school,

485
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,855
and now as an adult you're a bully.

486
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:32,737
Do you want to talk
about how you bully me?

487
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,192
I do, Cyril.
I really do,

488
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:35,927
but I'm afraid I'll tear up,

489
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,229
and then not be able to see the road

490
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:41,132
and then plunge us off the cliff,
and then if you're still alive,

491
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:44,402
strangle you to death with
my bloody and broken hands!

492
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,604
I also find it interesting that you,

493
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:49,524
Sterling Archer, man without fear,
are running away from your bully.

494
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:52,610
Because Cyril Figgis,
man without sense,

495
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,512
wasted all the ammunition!

496
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:55,947
[tires screeching]
Well, but I

497
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,548
think in a much larger sense

498
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,851
you've been running from
those two your entire life.

499
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:03,354
And whether it's your personal
relationships, or-- [yelps] Archer?

500
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:06,340
Take the wheel, dummy!
And you!

501
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:07,625
Me what?

502
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,127
[roars]

503
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,129
How you like that, Ivy?
[groaning]

504
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,515
Fighting somebody bigger and
stronger than you? Crazy, right?

505
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:19,804
Imagine what it was like for a
lonely, skinny 13-year-old kid

506
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:23,307
who'd been to six different
boarding schools since he was five!

507
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,010
Hint! It wasn't great!
[groaning]

508
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:29,647
[yelps] Yeah, just gonna
give them some space,

509
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,783
do the good old
"three Mississippi."

510
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,819
[both groan] But I hope it
was great for you, Ivy,

511
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,155
because your bullying days are over!

512
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,491
Go ahead, Swirling!
Shoot me!

513
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,661
Oh, huh-uh, you don't get
to take the easy way out, Ivy.

514
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,464
You're going to jail!
Well, you say that.

515
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,433
Whoa!

516
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:49,801
Archer!

517
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,302
[tires screeching]

518
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:54,839
[tumbling]

519
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:59,010
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, Archer!

520
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:00,645
Yes, what? Shut up.

521
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:03,014
Oh, my God, how are you still alive?

522
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,916
Jumped out at the last second, Cyril.

523
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:07,251
The same kind of
split-second decision-making

524
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:10,321
that caused you to leave
a bunch of clues in the safe!

525
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:11,923
Idiot!
Ow!

526
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,459
Did you learn nothing from this?

527
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:16,461
[chuckles]
No.

528
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,807
So listen, I know you've had
your heart set on AJ going to Country Day,

529
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:27,847
but I've really given it
some serious thought,

530
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,450
and I'm not sure
it's the best thing for her.

531
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,140
I know all kids can be bullies,
but at private school

532
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,511
it seems like there's even more, I
dunno, elitism or snobbery or whatever.

533
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:40,315
So I really want us to think about A.J.
going to public school.

534
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:43,285
Because studies have shown
that if a child's intelligent,

535
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:46,571
and I think A.J. really is, then it
doesn't matter where they go to school.

536
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,958
It's much more important that
learning is fostered in the home

537
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,127
by loving and supportive parents.

538
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,729
[horn blasting]

539
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,297
Plus with the restraining order,

540
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,466
you can't go within
500 feet of the school,

541
00:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,335
which means I'd be stuck doing
drop-offs and pick-ups every day.

542
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,305
Which, ya know, not doing that.

543
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:06,341
Anyway, so keep your
chin up, or down I guess.

544
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,143
Shapiro's at your
bail hearing right now,

545
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:09,778
so you'll be out of here before...

546
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,947
Um, dammit. Um...

547
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,982
You trying to think
of a lesbian joke?

548
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:17,352
No, hair joke.
Something about braids?

549
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:21,189
Ah, no, it's gone. Okay stay hard!
What?

550
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:25,437
Archer! Can you at least put some
money on my canteen account?

551
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,301
No!

552
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:31,572
