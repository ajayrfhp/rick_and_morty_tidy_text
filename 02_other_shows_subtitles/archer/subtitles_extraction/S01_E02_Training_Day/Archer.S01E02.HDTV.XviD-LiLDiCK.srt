1
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:04,807
Malory archer.

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:06,224
You get more beautiful every

3
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,449
Time I see you.

4
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:10,003
Oh, gussy. You minx.

5
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:11,647
You'll be the death of me yet.

6
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:13,561
But if I die, let it be with the

7
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,760
Name of this dusky jewel upon my lips.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,103
Lord feltchley, may I

9
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,823
Present miss lana kane?

10
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:21,961
Yes, you bloody well may.

11
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,285
Uh, it's so nice to,

12
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:24,291
Uh -- wow, okay.

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,283
That's, uh, kidskin you're

14
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:28,187
Slobbering on, so -- okay.

15
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:29,445
Wouldn't want to offend that

16
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,558
Boyfriend of yours, eh, wot?

17
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,452
Oh, offense taken, your lordship.

18
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,550
Glad to hear it, whoever you are.

19
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,714
Cyril figgis, isis comptroller.

20
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:39,213
And also my -- boyfriend.

21
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,250
Person I'm dating. We date.

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,672
No, you don't. No, no, no.

23
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,577
Your man's a rakish chap.

24
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:48,122
Air of mystery, chiseled good looks.

25
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:50,591
Oh, I think maybe you mean my ex.

26
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,357
Archer.

27
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,193
Archer! Exactly just!

28
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:55,007
Uh, that's -- and if memory serves, not

29
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,678
Only handsome but also --

30
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:59,276
A secret agent!

31
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,594
That's what I am.

32
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,909
And I shouldn't even be saying

33
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,449
That, but you have a certain

34
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,124
Thickness about you that I find

35
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,157
Very appealing.

36
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:09,510
Well, I find your drunkenness

37
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,438
Very unappealing.

38
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,736
I am drunk or I

39
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,937
Wouldn't be talking to you.

40
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,639
So if you'll please excuse me -- hey, come on.

41
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,119
Don't be like that.

42
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:19,491
Sterling, look out!

43
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,174
Feltchley!

44
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:23,153
You dirty sassenach!

45
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,519
We irishmen will never bow down

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,404
Before the english crown!

47
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:33,149
Ooh. Sterling archer.

48
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,715
That was totally ninja!

49
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,041
Il est incroyable, non?

50
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,970
Yeah, if you're, uh, into that.

51
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,812
Lana... Hmm?

52
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,225
Hello! Hey!

53
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,947
What's up, buddy? Uh, nothing.

54
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:47,612
Oh, dear.

55
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,153
Good show, archer!

56
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,457
You really saved my bacon.

57
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:51,435
Hey, come on.

58
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,619
You know I'd never let anything

59
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,157
Happen to your bacon.

60
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,190
I love you, santa claus!

61
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,512
What?

62
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,982
I do.

63
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:09,983
Sync by ee
www.addic7ed.com

64
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,803
Cyril, we've got big problems.

65
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,561
Well, it may seem daunting now.

66
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,859
But in the long run, the hsa

67
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,664
Makes a lot more sense than flex accounts.

68
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:39,770
Malory: I don't mean the health plan...unless it covers

69
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,695
Wandering-eye syndrome.

70
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,970
Cyril: well, that depends on

71
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,304
If that's a real thing.

72
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,799
Malory: oh, it's very real,

73
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,107
And lana has it. Cyril: wait. What?

74
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,562
Malory: cyril, I know you saw

75
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:51,347
How she looked at sterling last night.

76
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,439
Cyril: well, I think she was just shaken up.

77
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,545
Malory: stirred up, cyril, in the loins.

78
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,448
You -- you think her loins were stirring.

79
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,653
If not frothing.

80
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,260
Frothing? Oh, great. What should I do?

81
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,992
We should make you

82
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,889
Into someone for whom lana's

83
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,103
Loins get equally frothy.

84
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,861
And how exactly would we do that?

85
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:11,980
Well, she's obviously

86
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,580
Attracted to men of danger.

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,695
Like archer. Exactly.

88
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,123
The perfect field agent.

89
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,049
So who better to train you to become one?

90
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,195
Archer train me to be a field agent?

91
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:23,015
He's already been briefed, but only on the "What,"

92
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:25,078
Mind you, not the "Why."

93
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,233
No sense in telling him it's about lana.

94
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,416
Lana -- boy, wait till i tell her about this. No!

95
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,350
Cyril, under no circumstance is

96
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,937
Lana to know about our little...plan. Right.

97
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,607
I think -- oh, but about plans. Health plan switchover --

98
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:41,302
I'll take care of whatever that is.

99
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:43,516
You just concentrate on your training.

100
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,642
And archer's really okay with us?

101
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:50,239
Oh,ot at all, which is just gravy.

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
No, I just let mother

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,158
Think that because I know what

104
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,062
She's up to, vis-Ã -vis cyril and

105
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:56,687
Lana and me, and it's not

106
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,375
Broadening cyril's horizons. Trust me.

107
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,691
Mother's idea of horizon broadening is a lot of fights

108
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:05,766
Walking home from a lot of jazz-tap lessons.

109
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,726
I so enjoy our talks. You got them?

110
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,661
Then they're loaded and ready to go?

111
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,900
Seriously, krieger, you are my oprah.

112
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,685
So obviously, I'm not happy

113
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,959
About this whole arrangement --

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,315
But your mother is --

115
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,027
But I wonder what lana thinks about --

116
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,624
Oh, naot "Need to know" On this.

117
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:29,631
Wow, "Open purse, remove balls," Huh?

118
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,713
Besides, I'm sure it's not the first time you kept a

119
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:32,768
Secret from lana.

120
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:34,622
Uh, hello! Herpes?!

121
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,336
You ve la herp?!

122
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,851
Cyrhello, cheryl. It's carol.

123
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,490
What? Since when? Since I h it

124
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,648
Legally changed because you

125
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,023
Always call me carol.

126
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:46,587
Wow, that's -- excuse us.

127
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,515
What is this herpes business?

128
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,853
Sorry, bad joke... And a false alarm.

129
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:53,404
Lesson one, get used to that.

130
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,640
Should I be writing this down?

131
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,859
No! Never leave a paper trail.

132
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:59,350
That's lesson one. So ditch this.

133
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,675
Hey, that's --

134
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,285
...my dead mom's pen. Jesus!

135
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,063
Cyril did that!

136
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:06,123
Here, this is what a real field agent uses.

137
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,060
Huh, point's a lot finer than I prefer.

138
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,550
That's because it's a hypodermic needle and the

139
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,193
Cartridge is full of a deadly

140
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:16,011
Super-toxin called poizocaine.

141
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:19,727
Here. Keep it in here, but be careful.

142
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,733
The cap slips off for, like, no reason.

143
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,001
Oh, you're giving me the

144
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,069
Chuck noise, karen carpenter's stunt double?

145
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,857
I'm sorry. I thought you were walking backwards.

146
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,773
It's all the hsa switchover crap.

147
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm so over that lame flex account.

148
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,534
When does the hsa start?

149
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,992
When cyril e-files these dd-14s.

150
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,835
Oh, miss archer's taking care of those.

151
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,757
What?! Cyril's off somewhere with mr. Archer.

152
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,431
Cyril's off what? With whom?!

153
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,612
I think "Somewhere" was the "What" There and

154
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:51,460
"Mr. Archer" Was the "Whom." worlds collide, huh?

155
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,504
Kind of inevitable,

156
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,322
Really, for a serial workplace dater.

157
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:55,515
Oh, yeah!

158
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,968
Call the kettle black!

159
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:00,294
Did she just race-card me, or -- are you

160
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,625
Totally just gay for her?

161
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,043
I'm the human resources

162
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:06,181
Director, little miss hostile work environment!

163
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,727
She is riddled with herpes. Hey!

164
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,638
Inappropriate workplace topic...

165
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,813
And also a deal breaker.

166
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,032
Lesson one -- human intel -- shoot!

167
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,507
I forgot about the dd-14s.

168
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,806
Screw 'em! That's mother's headache.

169
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,952
You tell me -- does it look like I'm allergic?

170
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,598
Jesus jones. Y.

171
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:25,313
So, when I asked for

172
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,904
Cucumber slices, which one of

173
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,612
You idiots sent up zucchini?!

174
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,089
Uh, well, that, uh -- well, that --

175
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,937
That would be jane who did that.

176
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,202
Scatterbrain jane?

177
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,021
I know. She's just a mess.

178
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,063
Because this is obviously zucchini.

179
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,039
Oh, like you'd recognize a vegetable that

180
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,393
Wasn't wrapped in a monte cristo sandwich!

181
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:44,466
What's that supposed to mean?

182
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,599
That is pam,

183
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,821
Isn't it?

184
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,235
Okay, so, human intelligence entails --

185
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:52,239
Well, there's false flags, dead drops, dropouts,

186
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,499
Cutouts, active doubles, passive

187
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,518
Doubles, dangledoles, the

188
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,656
Often underappreciated honeypot.

189
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:00,599
Wow, that sounds like a lot to cover.

190
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,818
Yeah, so we may have

191
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:05,736
To gloss over almost all of it.

192
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:06,909
Weapon!

193
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,547
Hey, hon. Hey, back.

194
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,131
What, uh -- what's this?

195
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,548
Well, uh, see, uh, here's the thing.

196
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:16,855
Under no circumstance is lana to know

197
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,746
About our little...plan.

198
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,044
Here's what thing?

199
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:22,677
Archer's dd-14... Yeah.

200
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,060
...that we're on our way down to clear up with jane.

201
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,757
Really? Well, you know,

202
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,177
Scatterbrain jane.

203
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,535
And you're cooking dinner later?

204
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,894
Yes, I am. Yeah. Yep.

205
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:33,716
Spear gun?

206
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,113
Oh, I can't believe I just did that.

207
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:37,206
Yeah, dunce!

208
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,076
Now jane's a loose end.

209
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,642
Hey, jane!

210
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,577
You getting a snack?

211
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:45,189
Keep your story vague.

212
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,687
That's lesson one.

213
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,706
No, I mean, morality

214
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,252
Aside, how do you keep track of all these lies?

215
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,328
Practice, cyril.

216
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:55,958
Lying is, like, 95% of what I do.

217
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,191
In your job? Sure.

218
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:58,214
I got to admit, it was

219
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:59,792
Pretty cool how you handled that spear gun.

220
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,714
It was pretty cool.

221
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,177
Will I geto learn karate?

222
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,677
Karate? The dane cook of martial arts?

223
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:07,491
No, isis agents use krav maga.

224
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,988
Krav -- we've got an ex-mossad guy.

225
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,584
He comes in on thursdays.

226
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,207
Yeah, tuesdays he does a really rigorous spin class.

227
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,551
So, will I need sweatpants?

228
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,709
Cyril, you need all new clothes.

229
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,675
Well, what's wrong with these?

230
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:23,302
Sorry.

231
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:27,160
I was laughing at your clothes.

232
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,829
Wow, archer, you were right.

233
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,062
A tailored suit hangs so much better.

234
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,497
That's because woodhouse is a genius.

235
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,297
Like so many other geniuses, unappreciated in --

236
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,573
Shut up and hem, you

237
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:39,983
Old fruit!

238
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,293
Woodhouse: speaking of fruit,

239
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:44,272
Sir -- oh! Sorry. Cyril!

240
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:47,281
Cyril, check this out. Really?

241
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,414
Don't make it weird.

242
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:49,427
It's your friend.

243
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,438
And so's this baby.

244
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,094
Jeezy petes! It's a chekhov.

245
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,109
Russian-made, .25 caliber.

246
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:57,057
When would you use an underwear gun?

247
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:58,323
Hopefully never.

248
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:01,036
But say you're in a caribbean bungalow and you're

249
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,078
Kind of high.

250
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,467
An exotic woman on the bed.

251
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,045
Now, is she just the high-priced

252
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,419
Whore you asked for?

253
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,535
Or is she...an assassin?!

254
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:11,137
I don't know.

255
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,088
Here's room service. Who ordered champagne?

256
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,570
How should I know? Exactly!

257
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,243
You're baked. You can't remember.

258
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:17,265
But since when does it take

259
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,101
Three huge, surly jamaican guys

260
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,469
To deliver one bottle of

261
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,657
Champagne?

262
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:23,320
Because they're assassins, too!

263
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,788
Or maybe one guy's a

264
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:26,391
New waiter, the second one's

265
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,575
Training him, and the third's

266
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,793
From maintenance, finally off

267
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,148
His lazy ass to fix the c.

268
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,696
Yeah, I guess that could happen.

269
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,436
Point is, you come out of the john waving this

270
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:37,257
Around, nobody's gonna bug you for a tip.

271
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,927
Here. It's a gift. Thanks.

272
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:40,320
Wow, that is slippery.

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,016
And the safety's off, so be careful.

274
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,022
It could go off for, like, no reason.

275
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,110
Now, what are these pills?

276
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,159
Oh, just antihistamines -- mostly.

277
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,702
You just rest, miss archer.

278
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:54,224
We'll take care of these dd-14s for you.

279
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:56,306
Damn right you will.

280
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,506
Idiot.

281
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,712
Pam, look at this.

282
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,439
Holy shit snacks!

283
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,553
We have snacks?

284
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:02,771
Everybody's personal

285
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:03,942
Medical records!

286
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,152
Oh, no, we can't be looking at this.

287
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,365
It's totally confidential.

288
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,535
It totally should be.

289
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,702
Look at this.

290
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,018
Oh, my god.

291
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:12,192
Cyril tried to get his plan to

292
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,758
Cover a penis...ensmallment?

293
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:15,576
Who'd have thunk it?

294
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,934
I bet agent kane thunks it plenty.

295
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,656
You bet she does what

296
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,283
I bet she, uh -- no, I

297
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:23,329
Got nothing. That's what I thought.

298
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,224
You seen cyril? Is that lana?

299
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,976
Wow, happened to you?

300
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,489
Scatterbrain jane!

301
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,250
But let just tell you, okay?

302
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,788
You should be thankful you have cyril.

303
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,461
For about 12 reasons.

304
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,455
Well, thank you, malory.

305
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:38,784
But if you don't mind, I'd prefer to keep my personal

306
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:41,797
Affairs out of the office! Oh, please.

307
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:42,808
She's had more pens in that

308
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,156
Company ink than...aen store.

309
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,998
And yet...

310
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,710
...does not have herpes.

311
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,606
Deal un-breaker.

312
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,217
Trinette: what's the matter, baby?

313
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:56,810
'fraid you'lcah something?

314
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,025
No, it's not that!

315
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,040
I've just never been this close to -- call girl!

316
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
It's not an insult, cyril.

317
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,144
Trinette takes priden her work.

318
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,276
Trinette: I really do.

319
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,820
So come on. Budge in. Gosh.

320
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,098
Trinette: now, that's not so

321
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:11,410
Bad, is it? No.

322
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,632
That feels pretty good.

323
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:15,780
Trinette: ooh, I can tell. You are gifted.

324
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,689
God, it's just his gun, trinette!

325
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:18,630
Sorry.

326
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,051
Bet this seems pretty weird.

327
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,908
Trinette: oh, please. The sick shit I've done in

328
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,142
This apartment? Okay.

329
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,847
Trinette: and that wasn't all gun, neither. No, ma'am.

330
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,086
Hey, can you two focus -- please?!

331
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,914
Woodhous are you ready, or what?

332
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:30,810
Woodhouse: yes, quite ready,

333
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,856
Sir, though not entirely willing.

334
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,560
And I don't know if I am, either.

335
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,114
Trinette: could have fooled me!

336
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,382
It's perfectly safe.

337
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,407
You're tangoing, then your

338
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,403
Trained field-agent eyes spot two threats.

339
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,456
But they're not trained.

340
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,888
We haven't done this yet.

341
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,820
Archer: this is how you train them.

342
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,427
So you spot your first threat.

343
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:50,583
Woodhouse.

344
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:52,943
Woodhouse: my knees -- archer: bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

345
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:53,982
You put him down.

346
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:56,330
But just shoot the pad, not woodhouse.

347
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,774
Cyril: like actually shoot the gun?

348
00:11:57,774 --> 00:11:58,896
Archer: how else are you gonna learn?

349
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,294
Okay, he's down -- just the

350
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,705
Pad, though -- then you see the second threat.

351
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:05,248
Oh, no, you're out of ammo. Now what are you gonna do?

352
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:07,470
Cyril: oh, that's where the turn com in? Archer: duh.

353
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,856
Woodhouse, get in position.

354
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,078
Woodhouse: I really need a better health plan.

355
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,026
Archer: shut up. Weapon is hot, and live-fire

356
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:18,215
Exercise, in...5, 6, 7, 8.

357
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,039
Tango, tango, tango.

358
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,817
Scan the ballroom of the cuban

359
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,466
Embassy for the double agent

360
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,866
You're supposed to meet.

361
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,300
You're just some canadian dude

362
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,236
Down here on business, and... Threat!

363
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:30,312
Woodhouse!

364
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:31,584
Cyril!

365
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,443
Archer: shoot! Shoot, bitch!

366
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,110
Democracy's at stake.

367
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,417
Cyril: take that, forces of evil!

368
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,822
Trinette: way to go, baby. You hit it.

369
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,770
Cyril: yeah. I did, didn't I?

370
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,304
Archer: second threat, cyril.

371
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:45,419
Cyril: oh, right.

372
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,612
Jesus! Christ on sale!

373
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,110
Archer: yeah, cyril!

374
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,492
That was totally ninja.

375
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:54,854
Cyril: no, archer. That was totally uncool.

376
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,628
Archer: sorry, trinette. Did that hurt?

377
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,680
Trinette: yeah, it fricking hurt, idiot! It's ice.

378
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,127
Archer: okay, we'll use grapes.

379
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,038
Woodhouse: we've only lingonberries, sir.

380
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:03,666
Archer: are they

381
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,356
Ballistically similar to grapes?

382
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,262
Trinette: screw your grapes

383
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:09,183
And screw your whatever berries! I'm out of here!

384
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,397
Cyril: no, wait.

385
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:11,474
Trinette, please.

386
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,844
Trinette: please my fat irish

387
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:13,878
Ass!

388
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,488
What the hell's in your freaking

389
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:16,968
Pocket?

390
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,757
I don't feel so good.

391
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,190
Me neither.

392
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,381
Lana: and voice mail again.

393
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,475
So, it's me -- duh -- and did

394
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,998
You say you'd cook, or did I

395
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,256
Mishear that?

396
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:33,316
I know I misheard you about

397
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:35,028
Jane, because, turns out, I ran

398
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:36,853
Into her.

399
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:39,011
Lana: hey, jane.

400
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:41,275
You getting a tampon?

401
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,034
Yeah. Loose end.

402
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,242
But I'm sure you had a good

403
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,990
Reason to lie to me, so can't

404
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:47,666
Wait to hear what it was.

405
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,092
Archer: oh, my god!

406
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,418
You killed a hooker!

407
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,283
Cyril: call girl! Archer: no, cyril!

408
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:54,417
When they're dead, they're just hookers.

409
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,406
God, I said the cap slips off

410
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,157
The poison pen for no reason,

411
00:13:58,157 --> 00:13:59,219
Didn't I?

412
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,185
Cyril: but I just assumed that if anything bad happened --

413
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,646
Archer: no, do not say the

414
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,079
Chekhov gun, cyril.

415
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,361
That, sir, is a facile argument.

416
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,518
Woodhouse: and also woefully esoteric.

417
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:09,393
Archer: woodhouse.

418
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,706
Woodhouse: fetching a rug, sir.

419
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:13,300
Archer: now he's fetching a rug. Happy, cyril?!

420
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,372
Cyril: no! No, I'm not happy!

421
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:17,600
Archer: well, guess what! Me neither!

422
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,183
I mean, big picture, I wouldn't

423
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,343
Say I'm a happy person.

424
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,412
Woodhouse: sir, I have

425
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,554
Fetched the rug.

426
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,663
Archer: plus, now I'm out of a rug.

427
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,370
Oh, god, I should

428
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,119
Never have agreed to this.

429
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,812
You and your stupid mother and

430
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,399
Her stupid frothing loins!

431
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,512
I know you're upset,

432
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,006
But if you ever mention my

433
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,460
Mother's loins or their

434
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,722
Frothiness to me again, I don't

435
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,525
Know what I'll do, but it wi

436
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,617
Be bad.

437
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:45,925
Now let's go bury this dead

438
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,244
Hooker.

439
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,148
Shirt tales!

440
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,347
We need a password.

441
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:52,604
Hang on a second.

442
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:53,842
How you doing, miss archer?

443
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,466
I am good.

444
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,632
Okay try -- okay, try

445
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,709
"Guest."

446
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,325
Well, that's just idi-- oh, my god.

447
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,447
I know, right?

448
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,076
So here let's make the co-pay

449
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:05,955
Zero and the deductible --

450
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,011
Superhigh, right?

451
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,260
No. Low.

452
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,086
You want the lowest deductible.

453
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,204
But don't you deduct it on your taxes or

454
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,135
Something, so you want more?

455
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,248
And people think jane's stupid.

456
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,395
Cheryl: speaking of, it's

457
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,292
Probably better...if jane was

458
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,646
The last one to log in.

459
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,994
You are a bitch.

460
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,354
Malory: I am not!

461
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:26,537
Why, because I don't want

462
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:27,978
Sterling to end up with a woman

463
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:29,592
Like lana kane?

464
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:32,131
My god, a black...

465
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,510
Ops field agent?

466
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,230
Thought she was going in a whole other direction with that.

467
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,624
Malory: because let me tell you, I was black ops, and that

468
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,621
Does not, for a young boy, a

469
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,672
Very merry christmas make.

470
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,374
Woodhouse: "Ajax a success.

471
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:48,294
Tehran is ours. Stop.

472
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:50,158
Merry xmas from mommy and

473
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:51,720
Uncle kermit. Stop."

474
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,369
Also, uh, be nicer to woodhouse. Stop.

475
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,008
Archer: you made up that last part, didn't you?

476
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:59,238
Woodhouse: I did, sir.

477
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,159
Archer: douche. Oh, my god.

478
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,470
Cheryl: I know, right?

479
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,972
This is the most kick-ass health

480
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:05,239
Plan ever.

481
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,472
Malory: and I think I just had a flashback, so...these

482
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,568
Antihistamines are insane!

483
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,776
Archer: oh, I'm crazy?

484
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:14,549
Cyril, you're the one who killed

485
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:15,791
A perfectly good hooker.

486
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,754
By accident. We -- we could explain --

487
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:19,935
To who, cyril? The cops? Lana?

488
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,294
She'd never forgive me.

489
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,155
Archer, my life is ruined.

490
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:25,190
And all because mother cooked up this stupid

491
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,410
Plan to make you an agent just

492
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,588
To impress lana!

493
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,318
Ironic, isn't it?

494
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,640
I'm not sure that's technically irony. What?!

495
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,478
This is like o. Henry and

496
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,985
Alanis morissette had a baby and

497
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,250
Named it "This exact situation."

498
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,609
No -- yes, it is!

499
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,304
Because a man like you, cyril,

500
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,725
Doesn't deserve a woman like lana!

501
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:47,632
You butthole!

502
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,054
You set this all up just to

503
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:51,658
Drive me and lana apart.

504
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:55,353
Well? Screw you, archer!

505
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,645
Hostile work environment. Exactly.

506
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,076
I'm gonna file a hostile work

507
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,175
Environment lawsuit against you

508
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,510
And your mother and isis --

509
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,988
What? Who the hell is that?

510
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,399
Your confederates in

511
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,698
Operation butthole!

512
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:10,096
Nice try, archer, but

513
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,041
Cyril figgis ain't buying it.

514
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,111
You hear that?! I ain't buying it!

515
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,722
Oh, my god! How about now, cyril? Oh, my god!

516
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,880
Feeling ready to buy?

517
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,473
To scatterbrain jane.

518
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:24,595
And to plan-covered

519
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,910
Elective surgery.

520
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,438
And the boob job that

521
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,687
You so need.

522
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,036
And the ass-reduction

523
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:31,391
That you so need.

524
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,409
And the skinny-bitch-ectomy you need.

525
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,841
Oh, my god, did you hear that?

526
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:36,843
What do you think it is?

527
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:38,026
Immigrants.

528
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,119
That's all they do, you know --

529
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,715
Just drive around, listening

530
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,127
To raps, and shooting all the

531
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,781
Jobs.

532
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,563
Who are those guys?

533
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:46,591
How should I know?

534
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:49,246
Kgb, the stasi, shining path,

535
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:51,230
This guy I know named popeye?

536
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,471
I have enemies, okay?!

537
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,450
That's because no one likes you!

538
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,512
Seriously, do you not sense that?

539
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:59,016
I am a product of my upbringing, cyril.

540
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,021
Well, I was a single

541
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,068
Mother, and it'sig,

542
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,666
Dangerous world out there.

543
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,758
Are you idiots still even here?

544
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,727
So, why aren't you better at this?

545
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:09,888
I am the best at

546
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,710
This, rain man, okay?

547
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,715
I'm like -- who? James bond?

548
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,568
Well, I don't like to invite that comparison, but,

549
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,307
Yeah, basically. So do something!

550
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,770
I'm doing all kinds of stuff, cyril!

551
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,726
I'm shooting the gun, driving the car.

552
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,020
I could drive better than that.

553
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,070
Knock yourself out.

554
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,739
I'm ejecting. Oh, no. Oh, yes.

555
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,219
I am totally am.

556
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:30,811
Stop it. No.

557
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,660
There's grenades in the glove box.

558
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,889
Excuse me!

559
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,186
Yeah, I'm looking for two guys.

560
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:40,395
They're on their way to the morgue.

561
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,667
Great. Archer, what am I gonna tell her?

562
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,504
Well, if you learned anything today, it won't be the truth.

563
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,636
I don't care if you

564
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,149
Have 50 dead hookers in the trunk.

565
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,595
You lied to me. Did not learn anything.

566
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,355
Well, you shot a machine gun at me.

567
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,062
Around you.

568
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,852
Because my feelings were hurt.

569
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,842
Why on earth would you lie to me?

570
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:04,977
I just wanted to show you I could be a supcool isis

571
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,502
Field agent like archer.

572
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:07,877
But, baby, don't you

573
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:11,331
Know I...like you so much

574
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,502
Because you're exactly the

575
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,077
Opposite of archer? Well, yeah.

576
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:17,456
Not to mention your other qualities.

577
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,669
Oh, you are such a

578
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,357
Naughty nellie.

579
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:21,725
He just gets a pass,

580
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,091
Like milton berle?

581
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,611
Yup.

582
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,415
Hey, so, how did you

583
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,880
Know where I was?

584
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,910
When we first started going out, I may have...

585
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,193
Injected a tracking device into

586
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:34,264
Your body. In my body?

587
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:35,982
No, now, that is a breach of trust, lana.

588
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,359
Do you really want to open this can of trust-breachy

589
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,735
Worms, right aergh I caut you

590
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:41,189
And my ex-boyfriend with a dead

591
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:43,230
Hooker in thtrunk?

592
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,229
I do not. You do not.

593
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,293
Oh, and, archer, how's

594
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:50,436
This for ironic? Yo, you know what?

595
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,101
I don't have a "One to some other numb of douche bag"

596
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,816
Scale, so six.

597
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:57,542
Oh, my god. Trinette.

598
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,629
Trinette: yeah, trinette,

599
00:19:58,629 --> 00:19:59,808
You shit ass!

600
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:00,990
So, you know you

601
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,175
Have to be punished.

602
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
So what you're gonna do is walk

603
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,515
Into our veo store and b the

604
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,548
Nastiest, barebackingest,

605
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,649
Hard-dickingest, ball-slappiest

606
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:12,933
Interracial porno in there.

607
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,409
From the sweet, old korean lady?

608
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,575
Yup.

609
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:16,892
How you feel about that?

610
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,958
Like I got off pretty easy.

611
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,710
Night ain't over yet.

612
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,566
Trinette: throw me in a trunk?!

613
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,213
Not part of the plan.

614
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:25,468
Trinette: inject me with some crazy spy poison?

615
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,992
It was just a harmless tranquilizer.

616
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,197
And let's be hones-- I doubt

617
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,666
That's the first needle you ever -- ow.

618
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,013
Trinette: I never! Give me your wallet.

619
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:34,853
I already paid you.

620
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,660
Trinette: file a customer-service complai.

621
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,541
I'm re popeye would love to

622
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,500
Hear it. Come on.

623
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,626
You wouldn't tell popeye.

624
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:44,489
Oh, give me your watch.Me.

625
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:45,669
You know how much this thing costs?

626
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,854
Probably less than a new set of kneecaps.

627
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,217
There. Happy?

628
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:51,276
Trinette: almost.

629
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,572
You know, I bet there's a lesson to be learned

630
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:58,191
From all this, but I --

631
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,196
Oh, shit! My rug!
