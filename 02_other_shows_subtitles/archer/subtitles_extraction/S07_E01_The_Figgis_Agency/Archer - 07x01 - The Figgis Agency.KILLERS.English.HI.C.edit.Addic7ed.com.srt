00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,923
Apparently not.
And conversely,

161
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,625
anything you think you may
or may not have overheard,

162
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:59,495
regarding the Italian Prime
Minister's murder and dismemberment--

163
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:02,131
Alleged murder and dismemberment.

164
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,233
I couldn't care less,
Mr. Archer.

165
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,769
All that matters to me
is that you return the disk.

166
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,637
Now, good day.

167
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,109
[door opening]

168
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,478
[door closes]

169
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:18,547
[all laughing]

170
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,252
Holy shit, $100,000?

171
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:27,189
I was gonna say $10,000.

172
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:30,025
[laughing loudly]

173
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,161
Oh, my God!

174
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,930
[sighs] Yeah, what were
you gonna say, smart guy?

175
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,099
[continues laughing]

176
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,105
Nine!

177
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:47,009
[winding down]

178
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,710
[Archer]
Okay, people, listen up.

179
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,371
This is our first case,
and we're gonna crush it,

180
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,912
so listen up!
These are your assignments.

181
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,781
Pam.
Hey, in case you've forgotten,

182
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,016
the writing is literally on the wall,

183
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,819
and I give the orders around here.

184
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:09,255
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please, by all means.

185
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,190
Uh-huh. Um--

186
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, our--
Okay.

187
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,996
Archer has your assignments,
so listen up!

188
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:20,032
Truly inspiring, Cyril.

189
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,501
It's like Patton
and Churchill had a baby.

190
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,104
Oh, and put me down for 15
minutes of investigative work.

191
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,340
That wasn't even 15 seconds!

192
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,875
15 minutes is the smallest
manageable increment.

193
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,744
You dick!
Hey, shut up!

194
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:35,314
You... also dick!
With just a hint of Oscar Wilde.

195
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,816
Mother, if you're not gonna help,

196
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,751
maybe you'd be more comfortable
in your office.

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,620
No, I'm fine here.

198
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:44,357
I want to see how you're
gonna crack the big case.

199
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,392
Mancy Drew.
[all snickering]

200
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,861
Okay, Pam, this is
our target location.

201
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,563
[all chattering]

202
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:51,530
That's a nice house.

203
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,899
4220 Arroyo Canyon Road.

204
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,901
Find out everything
you can about this house

205
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,471
from the public records.
Plat map, utilities,

206
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,706
building permits--
Oh, and especially look

207
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,441
for any blueprints.
Oh, man!

208
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,809
Can't Cheryl do that?

209
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,312
I wanted to be the gruff
but lovable driver,

210
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,748
mechanic, and maybe
occasional muscle.

211
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,883
Like a folksy B.A. Baracus.

212
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:13,052
Fine. Carol,
you're head of research.

213
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,421
I'm on it.

214
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,257
How would one go about being on it?

215
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:20,059
Try the Internet.

216
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:21,894
And get everything you can
on the owner,

217
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:24,380
a lawyer named Alan Shapiro.

218
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:29,059
I think it's safe to assume
he doesn't eat shellfish.

219
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,618
Hey, not cool!

220
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,538
What?
The fact that he's a Hollywood lawyer

221
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,407
doesn't automatically
make him Jewish.

222
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,242
Eww, he's Jewish?

223
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,922
Probably, but that's not the point.

224
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,242
You can't say shit like that!

225
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,544
Wait a minute.
If you didn't know he was Jewish,

226
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,980
why'd you mention shellfish?
He's allergic!

227
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,548
You buttlicks.

228
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,950
That's why he made that big donation

229
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:50,686
to the stupid food allergy charity.

230
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,688
Oughta call it the Weak
Bloodlines Foundation.

231
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,790
Lana, you and I will
break into the house,

232
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,892
and since we can
assume there's a safe--

233
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,894
Ray? You care
to join us?

234
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:02,598
[sighs] I guess, since
we're hourly now.

235
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,734
Okay, you got comms, night vision,

236
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:07,970
infrared, alarm bypass,

237
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,972
suction cups, this crazy spray,

238
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,480
which shows laser beams, and just
in case there's a guard dog,

239
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,029
you got doggy treats loaded up
with tranquilizers, which I call--

240
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,678
Wait, wait, wait--
I got something for this--

241
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:19,214
"Hush puppies"
Uh, damn! That's better.

242
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:22,618
Duh. And since the front of the
house by the road is guarded 24/7,

243
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:26,488
you're gonna have
to go in from the rear.

244
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:28,457
No. You all
took it for granted.

245
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,459
But the back hangs off a cliff, like,

246
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,260
a hundred feet above the canyon!

247
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,998
Which is why I invented the
rocket-propelled grappling hook!

248
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,833
You didn't invent that.

249
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,901
Ah, that's what
the patent office said.

250
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,470
And how much is all this costing?

251
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,904
Oh, my God, Cyril.

252
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,539
You have to spend
money to make money.

253
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,409
No! You don't! You just
have to break into a safe!

254
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,810
[roaring whoosh]
[laughing]

255
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,846
[all yelling, screaming]

256
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:53,515
Shut that damn thing off!
Lame!

257
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,852
Well, what the heck <i>is</i> that thing?

258
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,620
Thermal lance.
For the safe!

259
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,322
Like Jimmy Caan used in<i> Thief.</i>

260
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,391
It'll cut through two feet
of reinforced concrete

261
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,627
like non-reinforced...
butter.

262
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,196
We don't need a thermal lance, ass.

263
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:10,132
Just a standard
safe-cracking kit.

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,734
Well, what's legendary about that?

265
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:15,337
You know, you guys could help.

266
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:17,406
Hey, you said you're the muscle.

267
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,207
And what are you doing here?

268
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:21,576
Pam's my ride home.
[sighs]

269
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,445
I can't even.
And Archer,

270
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,981
do you really need
to do that right now?

271
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,217
Yes, I do. Somebody left
an entire palm print, Lana.

272
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,020
Do you realize what skin oil
can do to the factory finish?

273
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,256
[laughs] You realize how
ridiculous you are,

274
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:35,557
for buying that automobile?

275
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,659
[scoffs]
What? Shut up, it's amazing!

276
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,946
Okay. So we'll just
follow you in the van,

277
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,956
and watch in amazement.
Haha!

278
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,441
Try to keep up!

279
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:47,213
So, my guess would be the fuel pump?

280
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:51,106
Great. Shut your guess-hole.
Oh, come on!

281
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:52,949
It's gotta be under warranty.

282
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,712
Right?
[sighs] I don't know.

283
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,815
Warranty's in Italian.

284
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,016
[all laughing]

285
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,255
[grappling hook whooshes]

286
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,159
[Archer]
Okay. Make sure they're secure.

287
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:15,194
'Cause they're
our only way out of here.

288
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:18,024
[sighs] Oh, I was hopin' T.C. was
gonna come pick us up in the chopper.

289
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,120
Ha!

290
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:21,440
Well, but he's gonna
be busy flying around,

291
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,242
searching for your battered corpses,

292
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:25,878
only to find out later
that all the coyotes left

293
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,948
was a pile of titanium gears
and a shitty weave.

294
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:30,549
[gasps]
First of all--

295
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,587
This is not a weave!
[giggling] Okay!

296
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,679
Well, it ain't a shitty one.

297
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,306
You should do the camera first.

298
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:43,978
I said do the cameras first!

299
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,065
[muttering]

300
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:48,067
I know, right?
How awesome is it to be back,

301
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,435
doing what we're best at?

302
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,904
What? Robbery?
It's not robbery, Lana.

303
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,939
It's burglary.
Or maybe home invasion,

304
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,642
if we run into anybody, which
hopefully we won't, but...

305
00:12:56,711 --> 00:13:00,012
I'm talking fieldcraft!
Stealth! Teamwork!

306
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,451
Night vision,
grappling hooks--

307
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,616
Whatever the hell Ray's doing.

308
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,164
Well, it better be the cameras.
Ray, are you doing the cameras?

309
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,399
[softly] Yes, Lana, I
was doing the cameras.

310
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:17,968
Okay, so cut the alarm
and jam the cell phone signal.

311
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,337
And Lana? The locks aren't
gonna pick themselves.

312
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:21,772
And meanwhile, you were doing...

313
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,208
I'm goin' infrared, Lana.

314
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,594
[gasps, laughs]
Holy shit!

315
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,880
It's just like<i> Predator!</i>

316
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,815
In 3-D!
Ow!

317
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:33,684
[sighs] Give me 90
seconds on the lock.

318
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,285
Sixty seconds on alarm and phone.

319
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:36,587
[Lana]
Not a competition.

320
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,555
Seriously, we were made for this!

321
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,157
We'll be out of here in no time.

322
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,326
Don't count your chickens
before they're hatched!

323
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,229
Okay, A, I'm pretty sure chickens
give live birth, like sharks.

324
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,931
What the--
And B, compared to espionage,

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,268
P.I. work is gonna be
a total cakewalk!

326
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,537
But... I doubt they've
gotten the disk yet.

327
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,706
Don't you think it's a little
premature to be celebrating?

328
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,875
Who's celebrating?
We're out of liquor!

329
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,844
But I admit, I'm
cautiously optimistic.

330
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,846
Because out here, you can buy
liquor at the grocery store?

331
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:05,082
Literally, the only thing
about Los Angeles

332
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,850
that doesn't make me want to vomit.

333
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,120
But I'm talking about
this new line of work.

334
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,457
A good detective and a good
spy share a lot of skills,

335
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:15,392
and I'll deny I ever said this,

336
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,694
but Sterling was an excellent spy.

337
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:21,465
So... maybe we can actually
make a go of this!

338
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,802
I mean, even Pam and Carol are
showing some talent for it.

339
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,438
[Carol gasps] Oh, my God, Pam!
I forgot to give

340
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:30,941
Mr. Archer one of the public records
that came back on that guy's address!

341
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,709
What? His license?

342
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:35,212
Well, I mean, it was
kind of a license.

343
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,247
[ferocious growling]

344
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:40,084
Oh! Mother of--

345
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,819
[laughing] Sweet Jesus!
What?

346
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:44,321
[screams]
Run!

347
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,058
No, no, no, don't run!
I got them... treats.

348
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,127
[screaming]
Owww!

349
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,796
Bad dog!

350
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,467
Oww!
Archer, lower your voice!

351
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,472
Why don't you make it quiet,
shoot up!

352
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,321
With what? We didn't bring guns.
What?

353
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,006
Plus, awww.
Oh, the treats. Give 'em the treats.

354
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:04,908
Wait, no, hang on.
[kissing noises]

355
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,244
Treats!
No, no, no, no, wait!

356
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,412
[screams]

357
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,513
[both gasping]

358
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,850
[Archer]
Ugh! Ooh!

359
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:13,817
[together]
Ooh.

360
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:16,854
[grunting, groaning]

361
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,105
[Lana] Well...
[dog groaning]

362
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:37,241
Aww, sleepy, babies.

363
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,076
Guess we oughta...
get crackin'.

364
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:41,812
Rim shot!
That'd be a good porn name.

365
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,360
Mine would be
"Lance Biggerstaff."

366
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,904
I'm picturing a gay wizard.

367
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:48,268
I always am.

368
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:51,522
[coughs, moans]

369
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,125
Eat a dick, gravity.
Aww.

370
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,861
No, I don't get this at all.

371
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,442
Maybe 'cause it's upside down.

372
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,633
Wait. Really?
Yeah, you're just kind of a hick.

373
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:05,502
Said the man with a relative
called, "Uncle Paw-Paw."

374
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,205
[scoffs] That's 'cause
he's my mother's...

375
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:09,706
Yeah, no.
Never mind.

376
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:11,141
So what's the deal?
How's that going?

377
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,143
[whispers]
It's goin' great!

378
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,812
And you talking is helping!
So, what do you think is on that disk?

379
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,781
Uh, duh, sex tape!

380
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,417
Please. She's like 100.
She's like 50.

381
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:23,287
And she's also Veronica Deane,
you big jealous bitch!

382
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,355
[muffled]
Archer?

383
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:29,126
Don't scream. Because you have
no reason to feel threatened

384
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,727
by Veronica Deane.
[annoyed grunt]

385
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,163
Am I attracted to her?
Obviously. I mean, come on.

386
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,232
You saw<i> Shanghai Moon.</i>

387
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,699
Oh, my God. That dress?

388
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,501
[chuckles]
Right. I mean, yeah.

389
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,570
Maybe it was 20 years ago,
but if anything,

390
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,038
she's hotter now--
Oww!

391
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:43,073
Shh!
Ow! Ow...

392
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,142
How could you even tell
if she was still hot?

393
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,077
She was basically just gigantic
sunglasses and a big hat!

394
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:49,446
Trust me, Lana, she's still hot.

395
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:52,683
Oh, and the joke's on you, because
if I have rabies, now you've got it!

396
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,631
Uh, I don't think you want
to get bitchy with me

397
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:55,986
about communicable diseases.

398
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:57,554
[scoffs]
Crabs aren't a disease!

399
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,990
Oh, my God. First of all...
[clattering]

400
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,327
So, if y'all are done having your
little post-fight-makeup-sex-fight--

401
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,155
That's not what we do!
[whispers] Oh, my God.

402
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:08,732
That is<i> all</i> you do! Now can we go,
before Shapiro knows we're here?

403
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:11,588
How would he?
Except for two sleepy grizzly bears,

404
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,365
we didn't leave...
[Man screaming]

405
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,564
Intruder!

406
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,790
Intruder!

407
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,343
That's bullshit.
How did he know?

408
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:23,814
Guards!
Yeah, but besides that?

409
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,583
Why didn't you tell us you were
bleeding like a Russian princess?

410
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:29,219
Because I honestly didn't know!
How could you not?

411
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:31,788
Because I took a bunch
of painkillers at the office!

412
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,357
Why?
[growls]

413
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:35,392
Because somebody left them out, Lana.

414
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:38,295
Move, you idiots.
They got the disk!

415
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:40,330
I am so angry at you right now!

416
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,299
Well, you shouldn't
give me that power--

417
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,867
[screams]
Jump!

418
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,737
Whoo-hoo!
Painkillers!

419
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:51,208
There! Agh! Agh!
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

420
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:55,245
Well, I hope you brought enough
painkillers to share with the class!

421
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,547
No. I ate 'em all.
Because we're all gonna get shot.

422
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:00,684
Relax. They're not gonna hit
us with those suppressors on,

423
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:03,287
they'd need a--
Grenade!!

424
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:06,239
And with that
having been said--

425
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,624
Son of a bitch!

426
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,926
Why does a divorce lawyer
have grenades?!

427
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,928
Ray, they're terrible people!

428
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:14,498
You assholes!
If they live, you die.

429
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,166
Archer, what are you doing?

430
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,168
Getting you out of here.

431
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:20,504
Ray, get her to the van.

432
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,306
What about you?
I'll be fine.

433
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:25,108
I lied, I got like,
20 more. Go!

434
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:26,877
Hang on, honey.

435
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:29,479
[Lana shouting]
Archer!

436
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:32,215
Wow, say what you will about cyborgs.

437
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,785
Sure can run good.

438
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:36,720
And I should take
the fast way down too, so--

439
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,723
[exhaling rapidly]

440
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,242
[screaming]

441
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,193
[Archer]
Ow!

442
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:48,365
[grunting]

443
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,417
[shouting]

444
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,278
[Cyril]
And now, Ms. Deane--

445
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,678
As promised, your computer disk.

446
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:03,415
And your cashier's check
for $100,000.

447
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,918
And while I appreciate
your firm's hard work,

448
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,619
I'm sure you'll understand when I say

449
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,321
I hope we never meet again.

450
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,924
A feeling that
I assure you is mutual.

451
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:14,526
Then I bid you good day and goodbye.

452
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,630
Yay!
[grunts]

453
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,966
Lower your voice.
[whispers] Ow.

454
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,201
Oh, let her enjoy it, Sterling.

455
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,573
We just made $100,000!
Well, minus expenses, which--

456
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:31,577
Which reminds me we need to
add an extra $1,200 to that.

457
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,947
For what?
Something called a<i> pompa di benzina?</i>

458
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,415
Called it.
No, you didn't!

459
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,917
And while you're at it,
add a case of champagne.

460
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,719
We deserve to celebrate.
[all gasping]

461
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,087
Ooh!
Bubbly!

462
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:44,289
Damn it, Veronica Deane already left?

463
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,191
I wanted her to sign this head shot.

464
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,328
Ooh, Joan Crawford's
gonna be so jealous.

465
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,363
You know what--
[woman] Excuse me.

466
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,765
[all groaning]

467
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,534
[Ray]
Oh, my God.

468
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,302
Is this the Figgis Agency?

469
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:00,038
Again, not married to that.
Yes, we are!

470
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,240
[chuckles]
And yes, it is.

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,409
I'm Cyril Figgis, owner, CEO,

00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,279
fully licensed investigator.
And you are?

473
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:09,181
She's...

474
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:14,152
She's...
My name is Veronica Deane.

475
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,754
[all gasping]
Oh, goddamn it.

476
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,390
May we talk somewhere privately?

477
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:21,026
Wait a minute.
If you're Veronica Deane,

478

then who the hell was--

Ow.

00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,368
Such a pleasure to meet you.

482
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,703
May I ask how you
heard of our agency?

483
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,008
My housekeeper found this under her
windshield wiper at the supermarket.
