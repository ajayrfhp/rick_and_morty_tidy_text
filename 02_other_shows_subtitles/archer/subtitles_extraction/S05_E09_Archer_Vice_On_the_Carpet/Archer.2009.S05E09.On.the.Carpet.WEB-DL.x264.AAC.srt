1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:04,361
(thunder crashes)

2
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:10,167
(clears throat)

3
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,006
(both shivering)

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,791
>> MALORY: Woodhouse?

5
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,259
>> WOODHOUSE: Mum.

6
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,027
>> MALORY: If I see this glass

7
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,596
empty again, I will be very

8
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:39,797
unhappy.

9
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,831
>> WOODHOUSE: Perish the

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,967
thought, mum.

11
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,969
>> MALORY: Now, then.

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,439
Who'd like to go first?

13
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,374
(Cyril coughs)

14
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,809
No?

15
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,478
All right, then I will.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,779
Idiots!

17
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,148
(both yelling)

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,517
Thank you, dear.

19
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:00,484
For a moment there, I thought

20
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:03,454
I was going to be unhappy.

21
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:05,523
Now, then.

22
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,092
Who's next?

23
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,867
>> ARCHER: Okay, so, uh...

24
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,602
I guess I'll go if...

25
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:52,570
>> MALORY: If I can just stop

26
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,904
you there.

27
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,040
Will you please cover yourself?!

28
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,041
>> CHERLENE: With what?

29
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,008
I don't have any...

30
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,210
(spraying)

31
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:01,512
There. Happy?

32
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,513
>> MALORY: No!

33
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:03,514
I didn't mean with whipped

34
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:04,548
cream!

35
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,516
>> PAM: It's actually whipped

36
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:06,550
cocaine, so...

37
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:07,518
(Malory groans)

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,519
>> MALORY: That explains where

39
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,853
some of it went.

40
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:10,955
>> CHERLENE: Mmm, and the tingly

41
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,423
numbness of my nipples.

42
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,457
>> MALORY: And why are you

43
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,959
dressed like the whore the rest

44
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,026
of the trailer park finally

45
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:17,027
decided they had to stone to

46
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,228
death?

47
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,196
>> CHERLENE: Duh, we were

48
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,931
shooting my album cover.

49
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,232
>> KRIEGER: Yes!

50
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:24,635
Good, yes, that is perfect!

51
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:25,970
>> PAM: Perfect for what?

52
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,237
Come on, it's an album cover,

53
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,941
not a... Amish Bible!

54
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,276
>> PAM: You got to sex that shit

55
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,310
up sexy.

56
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,378
>> KRIEGER: Um...

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,412
>> CHERLENE: I think it's pretty

58
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:36,380
sexy.

59
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:37,982
>> PAM: You think that's sexy?

60
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,249
With the rocket pops...

61
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,618
outside of you.

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,086
>> CHERLENE: I mean...

63
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:43,420
>> KRIEGER: But if she eats

64
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:44,421
them, we lose the whole red,

65
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:45,990
white and... okay...

66
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,091
>> PAM: Yeah, not talking about

67
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,125
eating them.

68
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,426
>> CHERLENE: Wait, what are

69
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:51,095
you... You want me to put a

70
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,097
rocket pop in my vagina?!

71
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,232
>> PAM: Well, for starters.

72
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:56,667
But let's not rule anything out.

73
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:57,768
You know? Let's kind of see

74
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,769
where that leads.

75
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,104
We've got a shitload of film.

76
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:01,271
>> KRIEGER: I'm supposed to have

77
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:02,239
film in this?

78
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,240
>> CHERLENE: Goddamn it!

79
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:04,274
>> PAM: Krieger!

80
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,743
>> LANA: So, I have a question.

81
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:06,777
>> PAM: The butthole, Lana, is

82
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:07,745
what I was...

83
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:08,946
>> LANA: Yeah, I got that.

84
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,114
But do you think the cover for a

85
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,582
country album should be

86
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,117
hardcore...?

87
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,418
What do you even call that?

88
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,686
Food porn?

89
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,687
>> PAM: I do.

90
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,288
>> LANA: You think it makes a

91
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,490
good country album cover

92
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,091
or you call it food porn?

93
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,092
>> PAM: Yes.

94
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,093
>> LANA: Are you...?

95
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,128
(Cherlene squealing)

96
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,129
>> CHERLENE: These things are

97
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,130
freezing!

98
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,131
>> KRIEGER: Film, film, film,

99
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,098
film, film!

100
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,133
>> LANA: Quit putting rocket

101
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,035
pops in your ass!

102
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:33,003
>> CHERLENE: I'm eating them.

103
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,005
Jesus, what is wrong with you?

104
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,273
>> LANA: I guess I just don't

105
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,341
get art.

106
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,442
>> PAM: You obviously don't.

107
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,510
And it's not that we don't

108
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,511
appreciate criticism.

109
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,512
It just needs to be

110
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,479
constructive.

111
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:43,514
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

112
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,481
>> MALORY: Shut up.

113
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,649
And then tell me what happened

114
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:46,684
to the hundred pounds of...

115
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:47,651
>> BOTH: Kilos.

116
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:48,652
>> MALORY: Kilos, thank you,

117
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:49,687
shut up.

118
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,688
Of cocaine that you took to

119
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,722
Colombia.

120
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:52,690
>> LANA: Which...

121
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,724
>> MALORY: Lana, when I want you

122
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,159
to talk, I will tell you, and

123
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:56,393
until then, zip it!

124
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,494
>> LANA: Wha...? What did I do?

125
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,462
>> MALORY: Nothing!

126
00:03:58,464 --> 00:03:59,496
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

127
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,464
>> MALORY: Which is why these

128
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,732
feckless idiots lost 200 kilos

129
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,134
of cocaine!

130
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:05,703
>> ARCHER: Yeah, La... Oh.

131
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,504
Uh, okay, technically, but then

132
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:09,139
we stole a plane loaded with,

133
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,375
like, twice as much cocaine!

134
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,343
>> MALORY: Is this the part

135
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,378
where you tell me to look under

136
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,180
my seat?

137
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,314
>> ARCHER: No, unfortunately we

138
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:18,816
ran into some...

139
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,417
>> CYRIL: Assholishness.

140
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,352
(all yelling)

141
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,855
>> RAY: Archer, I swear to God!

142
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,690
I will crash this plane right

143
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,692
into the goddamn ocean!

144
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:29,693
>> ARCHER: I'll take my chances

145
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:30,694
with the ocean!

146
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,196
The ocean isn't full of

147
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,263
alligators!

148
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,364
And do not even think about it,

149
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,399
Cyril!

150
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,533
>> CYRIL: Ray, what do I do?!

151
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:37,501
>> RAY: Uh...

152
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,502
I guess hang on.

153
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:39,503
(grunts)

154
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,537
>> ARCHER and CYRIL: Whoa!

155
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,538
(both grunting)

156
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,507
>> RAY: Sorry, Cyril.

157
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,508
>> ARCHER: Ow.

158
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,509
>> CYRIL: Oh, shut up.

159
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,543
It's your own fault.

160
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,544
>> ARCHER: Debatable.

161
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:48,545
>> CYRIL: No, it's...

162
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:49,546
>> ARCHER: Shut up.

163
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,547
Come on, Ray, there has to be

164
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:51,515
somewhere to land besides the

165
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,217
middle of the damn Everglades.

166
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:54,184
>> RAY: Well, not within fuel

167
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:55,185
range, so...

168
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,186
>> ARCHER: And who's fault

169
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:57,221
is that?

170
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,355
>> RAY: Isaac goddamn Newton!

171
00:04:58,357 --> 00:04:59,456
You see that airstrip?

172
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,557
The one that's circled?

173
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,725
That's the only one in range,

174
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,227
and we've only, barely, got

175
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,228
enough fuel to make it there,

176
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,229
so...

177
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,363
>> ARCHER: But Miami's, like,

178
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:07,364
right over here.

179
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,398
>> CYRIL: We can't land at a

180
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,366
real airport!

181
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:10,400
Even if Ray had filed a flight

182
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:11,368
plan...

183
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,569
>> ARCHER: Why <i>didn't</i> you file

184
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,737
a flight plan?!

185
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:15,739
That's like Airplane Stuff 101.

186
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:16,907
>> CYRIL: Not when the airplane

187
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,308
is stolen and crammed full of

188
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,543
guns and cocaine!

189
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:20,577
>> ARCHER: Ah.

190
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,578
I will concede that point.

191
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,613
>> RAY: Damn it.

192
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,580
>> ARCHER: What's up?

193
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,581
>> CYRIL: What's going on?

194
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,616
>> RAY: Burning too much

195
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:26,617
fuel-- we're heavy.

196
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,584
>> CYRIL: What do you mean,

197
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,585
heavy?

198
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,620
>> ARCHER: You said we had

199
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,587
enough fuel to...

200
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,622
>> RAY: I said barely!

201
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,589
I bet the Colombians didn't

202
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,624
count on three passengers.

203
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,591
>> CYRIL (sobbing): Oh, my God,

204
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:35,626
we're gonna crash!

205
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:36,660
>> ARCHER: Cyril, do not panic.

206
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:37,628
Just get out.

207
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,629
>> CYRIL: What?!

208
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:39,630
>> ARCHER: Do the right thing,

209
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,664
Cyril.

210
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,232
You have nothing to live for.

211
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,734
>> CYRIL: Get your hands off me.

212
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,602
>> ARCHER: Okay, relax. Jesus.

213
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,603
Whatever happened to Team

214
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,604
Archer?

215
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:48,572
>> CYRIL: Please tell me that

216
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:49,807
was never a real thing to you.

217
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:50,808
>> ARCHER: Eh... I mean...

218
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,809
>> RAY: Hello?

219
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,277
Time's a bit of a factor here!

220
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,578
>> ARCHER: Cyril, for the love

221
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,779
of God, man, jump!

222
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,814
>> CYRIL: Just throw out the

223
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:57,848
cocaine.

224
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,116
>> ARCHER: What?! No!

225
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,150
I'm not telling Mother I lost

226
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,151
the original hundred pounds

227
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,119
of...

228
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,120
>> CYRIL and RAY: Kilos!

229
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,154
>> ARCHER: ...whatever unit of

230
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,122
measurement-- of cocaine!

231
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,124
Plus, all <i>this</i> cocaine!

232
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,158
Do you have any idea how mad

233
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,859
she'd be?

234
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:09,827
>> RAY: Well, the

235
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,428
alternative is a belly-landing

236
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,462
in a swamp filled with

237
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,430
alligators!

238
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:14,431
>> ARCHER: No. No, no, no. No.

239
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,465
What if, um...

240
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,433
>> CYRIL: Archer!

241
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,467
Alligators or your mother!

242
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:18,468
>> ARCHER: What's the

243
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,469
difference?

244
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,470
They're both cold-blooded

245
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:21,805
prehistoric monsters.

246
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,307
(Malory clears throat loudly)

247
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,608
>> MALORY: Excuse me?

248
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,776
>> ARCHER: I meant the pain of

249
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,377
disappointing you would...

250
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,513
bite... alligator... ish...

251
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,480
ly.

252
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,481
>> MALORY: Uh-huh.

253
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:32,516
>> ARCHER: Anyway, right about

254
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,517
then...

255
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,518
>> RAY: Okay, I can see the

256
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,519
airstrip.

257
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,486
>> CYRIL: Well, can we make it?

258
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:37,487
>> RAY: Maybe, if you...

259
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,689
>> ARCHER: Wait! Ray, you said

260
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,857
the Colombians were flying to

261
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,824
 <i>this</i> airstrip?

262
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:41,859
>> RAY: Yes!

263
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,893
Why do you think it's marked on

264
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:44,461
the chart, you idiot?

265
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,462
>> ARCHER: Okay, well, let's

266
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:46,697
circle back to who's an idiot,

267
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,465
and talk about who's probably

268
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,867
waiting <i>at</i> this airstrip.

269
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,834
(Cyril gasps)

270
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:51,835
>> RAY: Dukes.

271
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:52,870
>> ARCHER: <i>And</i> what their

272
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,204
reaction will be to three total

273
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,873
strangers showing up in their

274
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,876
plane without their coke.

275
00:06:58,878 --> 00:06:59,877
>> CYRIL: They'll kill us!

276
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,211
>> RAY: Well... maybe not.

277
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,179
>> ARCHER: Wait, why?

278
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,380
>> CYRIL: Why maybe not?

279
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,648
(sputtering)

280
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,682
(Archer and Cyril shout)

281
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:06,650
>> RAY: Because that.

282
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,651
(sputtering)

283
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:08,886
(Archer and Cyril shout)

284
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,387
And that.

285
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,855
Happy?

286
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:12,823
>> ARCHER: What, like, in

287
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,391
general or...?

288
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,692
>> MALORY: Ooh, this is

289
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:16,860
exciting.

290
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,395
I hope everyone dies.

291
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,530
>> ARCHER: Uh, we obviously d...

292
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:24,735
Oh. Hardy har, Mother.

293
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,337
(slurps)

294
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,511
>> MALORY: And so our heroes,

295
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:35,846
such as they are, have run out

296
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:38,548
of fuel and... what.

297
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,883
>> RAY: No, no, no!

298
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,184
What are you doing?!

299
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,552
>> CYRIL: Throwing out the guns!

300
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:44,588
>> RAY: No, no, no, no, no!

301
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,622
You're screwing the trim all to

302
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:46,757
hell!

303
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,858
>> ARCHER (chuckles): This

304
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,526
no-phrasing thing is killing me.

305
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,560
>> RAY: Best case, our

306
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,529
glide ratio's maybe ten-to-one.

307
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:53,697
But it's a lot less with the

308
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,065
damn door hanging...

309
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,066
Oh, no, no, no!

310
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,401
(automatic gunfire)

311
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,368
>> CYRIL: Yeah!

312
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,403
>> ARCHER: Woooooo!!

313
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:00,537
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

314
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,571
(Archer and Cyril grunt)

315
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,539
>> RAY: You idiots!

316
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,540
>> CYRIL: What did I do?

317
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,541
>> ARCHER: Don't. There's no

318
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,575
talking to him when he gets like

319
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:06,576
this.

320
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:07,878
>> RAY: Dump the damn guns!

321
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,879
>> CYRIL: Uh, I am, if you'd

322
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:09,880
shut up!

323
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:10,881
>> ARCHER: Wait, wait, wait,

324
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,282
wait, Cyril!

325
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,884
>> CYRIL: What? Archer!

326
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:14,885
>> RAY: We're coming in!

327
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:15,953
Brace for landing!

328
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,387
>> ARCHER: Tell you in a minute.

329
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,622
>> RAY: Gear down!

330
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,723
(Cyril moans)

331
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,558
>> RAY (strained): We're not

332
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,461
gonna make it.

333
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,596
(Cyril whimpers)

334
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:27,664

335
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,234
(Cyril yelping)

336
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:34,504
(Archer chuckling)

337
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,473
>> ARCHER: Oh, so, Cyril...

338
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,443
what I was gonna say was...

339
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:40,644
maybe don't throw out all the

340
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,612
guns because you know what they

341
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:43,947
say...

342
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:44,915
it's better to have a gun and

343
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,016
not need it than to be the

344
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,651
world's biggest dickhead, and

345
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,586
inside your head there's a

346
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,922
million more dicks, like, uh, if

347
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,090
you cut open a golf ball, only

348
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:54,424
instead of those little rubber

349
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:55,659
bands in there, it's just, you

350
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,827
know...

351
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,095
>> CYRIL: Dicks?

352
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,296
>> ARCHER: Oh, so you have heard

353
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,597
that.

354
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,299
>> MALORY: And so Gillette lands

355
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:03,633
safely-- I'm sure there's a joke

356
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:05,435
in there about fairy dust-- and

357
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,470
then what happens?

358
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,437
>> CYRIL (chuckles): Yeah, tell

359
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,472
her what happens next.

360
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,439
>> ARCHER: I will if you shut

361
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,474
your... mouth.

362
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,442
(quietly): Okay, listen up.

363
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,477
Say what you will about my

364
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,478
skills as a drug kingpin...

365
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,445
>> RAY: You don't have any.

366
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,446
>> CYRIL: Completely

367
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:17,447
nonexistent.

368
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,448
>> ARCHER: Are you done?

369
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,483
>> RAY and CYRIL: Yes.

370
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,450
>> ARCHER: Good, because if

371
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:21,651
there's one thing I'm good at,

372
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:22,686
out of the million other things

373
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm good at, it's infiltrating

374
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:24,821
the enemy with an assumed

375
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:25,789
identity.

376
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,790
>> RAY: Named Randy.

377
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:27,824
>> ARCHER: Named shut up, it's

378
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:28,825
not always Randy.

379
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:29,793
>> GILLETTE (chuckling): Oh, my

380
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:30,827
God.

381
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,828
>> CYRIL: Always.

382
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,030
(others agreeing)

383
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,498
>> ARCHER: That's because

384
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,699
Randy's awesome!

385
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,467
And I'm the best in the world at

386
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,735
this, so shut up and follow my

387
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,804
lead.

388
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,706
Hey, guy... (grunts)

389
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,142
(Ray and Cyril squeak)

390
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:46,343
>> SLATER: Anybody else in

391
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,844
there?

392
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,813
>> RAY and CYRIL: No.

393
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,148
(others reacting in shock)

394
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,749
>> MALORY: Sterling, how are you

395
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:53,817
not dead?

396
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:54,818
>> ARCHER (sighs): Because I

397
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,186
didn't get shot with buckshot.

398
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,487
I got beanbagged.

399
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,488
(Pam growls)

400
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,323
Beanbagged, Pam.

401
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,491
(others gasp, groan)

402
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,526
>> MALORY: Oh, my God.

403
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:03,527
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I could've

404
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:04,528
died.

405
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,495
>> CYRIL (scoffs): It was a

406
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,530
beanbag.

407
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,931
>> ARCHER: Medical fact, Cyril.

408
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:08,999
If you get hit in the chest

409
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,734
between heartbeats, you can die.

410
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,868
Go ask Houdini.

411
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,836
>> PAM (chuckling): Ask him

412
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:17,374
what, how to get AIDS?

413
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,675
>> MALORY (sighs): So who were

414
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,010
these goons?

415
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,044
>> ARCHER: They were... They

416
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:22,512
kind of looked ex-military, now

417
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:23,680
that you mention it.

418
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:24,681
>> MALORY: American.

419
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:25,682
>> ARCHER: Yeah, and the

420
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:26,683
leader's name was...

421
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:27,851
>> SLATER: Slater.

422
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,086
Just call me Slater.

423
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,587
And sorry about the beanbag.

424
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,055
Man, that must kill.

425
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:33,090
>> ARCHER: Yeah. Yeah, you hear

426
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,591
"beanbag," you think Beanie

427
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,726
Baby, not... internal bleeding.

428
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,861
>> SLATER: Well, the door was

429
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:38,895
shot off, and we didn't know who

430
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,896
you were.

431
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:41,565
Still don't, I guess, formally,

432
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,233
uh...

433
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:45,068
>> ARCHER: Uh, Rand... o.

434
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,069
>> SLATER: Rando.

435
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,037
>> ARCHER: Yep.

436
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,071
>> SLATER: Rando...?

437
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,539
>> ARCHER: Uh, no, that's it.

438
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,075
It's a mononym, like Cher.

439
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,410
>> CYRIL: Pliny.

440
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:54,377
>> RAY: Cantinflas!

441
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,378
>> SLATER: I know what "mononym"

442
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,580
means.

443
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:57,747
What I don't know is who you

444
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:58,915
people are.

445
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,050
>> ARCHER: Uh, I'm Rando-- I

446
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,751
think we covered that fairly

447
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:03,587
well-- and these are the, uh,

448
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,088
McCracken brothers, Phil and

449
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,056
Odie.

450
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,090
>> CYRIL: Hello.

451
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,091
>> RAY: Odie, hush.

452
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,059
>> SLATER: So why do you guys

453
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:10,060
have my cocaine?

454
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,061
>> ARCHER: We...

455
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,129
>> SLATER: I'm not done.

456
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,130
>> ARCHER: Sorry.

457
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,264
>> SLATER: What have you done

458
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,500
with Gomez...

459
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,803
What, you're just not gonna

460
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,104
answer?

461
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:23,073
>> ARCHER: Oh! S-Sorry.

462
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,141
You kind of trailed off like

463
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,109
there was, like, a third...

464
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:27,110
>> SLATER: Why do you have my

465
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:28,612
cocaine and where the hell is

466
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,113
Gomez, full goddamn stop!

467
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,148
>> ARCHER: Gomez was gonna steal

468
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,449
it.

469
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,450
>> SLATER: Says who?

470
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,784
>> ARCHER (chuckles): "Who."

471
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:35,819
Nice.

472
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,988
Anyway, they called us in, uh,

473
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,457
to address that, which we did

474
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,059
and now we're here and...

475
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,131
Full stop?

476
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,132
>> TOUGH GUY: Okay, this is the

477
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:50,100
last of it.

478
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:51,101
The weight's good.

479
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:52,135
We tested ten of the bricks.

480
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,170
Looks like it's all here.

481
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,171
>> SLATER: Well, either you guys

482
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,172
are the shittiest coke thieves

483
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,206
on the planet...

484
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,174
>> CYRIL (chuckles): Which we

485
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,208
are not.

486
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,010
(chuckles) You know, I mean, if

487
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,111
that was... I mean, if we put

488
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:02,445
our minds to it.

489
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,513
Look, here's the thing about the

490
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,481
McCracken brothers...

491
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:05,482
>> ARCHER: Odie, hush!

492
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,716
Uh, you were saying?

493
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:07,851
>> SLATER: Hey, between you and

494
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,119
me, I thought Gomez was hinky

495
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,620
from the get-go and, since the

496
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:11,955
coke's all here, let's get you

497
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:13,890
fellas loaded.

498
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:14,958
>> ARCHER: Yeah, now you're

499
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,793
talking.

500
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,162
About something else entirely.

501
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:20,197
Apparently.

502
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,198
>> SLATER (chuckles): What, did

503
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,165
you nerf-nuts think I was

504
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,633
talking about getting drunk?

505
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,802
>> ARCHER: Uh, yeah, on money.

506
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,470
>> SLATER (laughing): Oh, man,

507
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,805
classic Rando.

508
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,973
And don't worry, Calderon's good

509
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,575
for the money.

510
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:32,842
At least for now.

511
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,010
Am I right, fellas?

512
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,011
>> ARCHER: Are you?

513
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,146
>> SLATER (laughs): Classic

514
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:37,681
Rando.

515
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:38,648
>> ARCHER (chuckles): Yeah,

516
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,849
Rando's awesome.

517
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:40,850
>> SLATER: So, obviously you're

518
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:41,818
not gonna be able to pressurize

519
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,819
this baby, so, uh...

520
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:43,820
>> RAY: I'll keep it under

521
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:44,854
8,000.

522
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:45,855
>> SLATER: Still gonna freeze

523
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:46,856
your asses off.

524
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,824
Good thing you're flying south,

525
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:48,825
huh?

526
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:49,859
>> ARCHER: Mmm... yep.

527
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:50,860
>> SLATER: You do know where

528
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:51,861
you're going, right?

529
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:52,862
>> ARCHER: I absolutely know

530
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:53,863
where we're going.

531
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,098
>> CYRIL: Yeah, back home to

532
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,866
ask Mommy what to do.

533
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:57,867
>> ARCHER: Hey, shut up!

534
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,102
>> CYRIL: You shut up!

535
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:01,371
>> ARCHER: Ow. (grunts)

536
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:05,609
Ma, they done killed old Rando.

537
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,847
>> LANA: So, you leave here with

538
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,082
a bunch of the first load of

539
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,583
cocaine, which just mysteriously

540
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,085
appeared at ISIS and that Malory

541
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,052
swears wasn't hers...

542
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,053
>> MALORY: Because it most

543
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:18,021
certainly was not!

544
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:19,055
>> CYRIL: Wait, then where did

545
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,056
it come from?

546
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:21,057
>> MALORY: Obviously from

547
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,058
Sterling.

548
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,059
>> ARCHER: Obviously from

549
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:24,060
Mother.

550
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,061
>> MALORY and ARCHER: No, not

551
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,062
from me! Well, I certainly...

552
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,097
(high-pitched whistle)

553
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,031
(others groaning)

554
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,232
>> LANA: Sorry to break that up.

555
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,700
I love <i>Freaky Friday</i> as much as

556
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:32,235
the next gal, but let's just

557
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:33,703
press on, operating under the

558
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,071
assumption that one, or more

559
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:36,239
likely both, of you are lying

560
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:37,240
and that...

561
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:38,208
>> MALORY and ARCHER: Lana, I

562
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,209
swear...

563
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:40,210
>> LANA (whistles): Pressing on.

564
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,711
So then you stumble into another

565
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,046
bunch of cocaine in the jungle

566
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:44,914
and then continue stumbling into

567
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,716
a beanbagging arms dealer, so

568
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,219
that now, almost inexplicably,

569
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:50,820
we have enough weapons to invade

570
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:51,888
Quebec.

571
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,089
>> KRIEGER: Wait, literally?

572
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,224
>> LANA: No, Krieger, not

573
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,225
literally.

574
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:56,226
>> PAM: Aww.

575
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,227
>> CHERLENE: Lame.

576
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:58,228
>> KRIEGER: Well, if we ever do,

577
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,229
the best time to invade is

578
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,330
right after brunch, when

579
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:01,298
they're all logy.

580
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,299
>> LANA: Archer?

581
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,300
>> ARCHER: I don't know.

582
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,734
I mean, it couldn't hurt, but...

583
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:05,769
>> LANA: Still talking about

584
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,736
this.

585
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:07,737
Not invading Quebec.

586
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,972
>> ARCHER: Oh, yeah, then they

587
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:09,973
loaded the plane with the

588
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,341
weapons, said we were heading

589
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:12,942
south and that Calderon would

590
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:13,910
pay us.

591
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:15,145
>> LANA: Calderon?

592
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,847
(gasps) As in Gustavo Calderon?

593
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:20,583
>> ARCHER (burps): Should I know

594
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:21,584
who that is?

595
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,619
>> CYRIL: How could you not?

596
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:23,586
>> ARCHER: I don't know, Cyril.

597
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,954
Maybe I was busy saving your

598
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:26,923
life once, and then you shot me.

599
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,291
>> MALORY: Gustavo Calderon, aka

600
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,794
Baby Gus, is the president of

601
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:31,761
San Marcos.

602
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:32,796
(Archer burps)

603
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:33,963
>> ARCHER: Should I know...

604
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:34,964
>> MALORY: Oh for God's sake,

605
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,000
Sterling, it's a country in

606
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,301
Central America.

607
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:39,302
>> ARCHER: Mm, not according to

608
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,303
this.

609
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:41,271
>> LANA: Because that thing's a

610
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:42,272
hundred years old.

611
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,273
It still says "German East

612
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:44,307
Africa."

613
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,308
>> KRIEGER: We will <i>never</i>

614
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,276
recognize Tanganyika!

615
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:47,277
>> LANA: Well, it's Tanzania

616
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,278
now, so...

617
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,279
>> PAM: Aww.

618
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,280
>> CHERLENE: Lame.

619
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:51,281
>> KRIEGER: Well, whatever, as

620
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:52,282
long as they don't nationalize

621
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,283
the ivory trade.

622
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,884
I don't think my portfolio can

623
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:57,287
take the hit.

624
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,621
>> LANA: Trust me, San Marcos is

625
00:14:58,623 --> 00:14:59,622
a country.

626
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:00,957
>> MALORY: And it's in the

627
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,125
middle of a civil war.

628
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,326
Communist rebels are tearing

629
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,661
through the countryside like...

630
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:05,662
like...

631
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:06,830
>> PAM: Cows.

632
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:07,797
Bees.

633
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,165
Hang on.

634
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,166
Bees.

635
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,201
>> MALORY (sighs): How do you

636
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,802
not know about San Marcos?

637
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,304
It's all over the news every

638
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:15,872
night.

639
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,006
>> ANCHORMAN: from San Marcos

640
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,308
tonight, as the Communist rebel

641
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,176
forces consolidate their gains

642
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:21,845
in the countryside, and now

643
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,513
prepare to move on the capital.

644
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,315
We spoke with President Gustavo

645
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,751
Calderon, seen here volunteering

646
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,219
at the hospital, comforting the

647
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,253
wounded.

648
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,221
>> CALDERON: Oh, hello, I did

649
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,255
not see you there.

650
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:33,223
I was comforting this brave

651
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,024
young man here, the fruit of San

652
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,394
Marcos, wounded by a Communist

653
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,395
sneeper.

654
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,996
I think he has died.

655
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,030
Yes.

656
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,365
But let me say this, to the

657
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,733
Communists who are murdering

658
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,502
our brave young fruits, and to

659
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,270
the puppet masters in Moscow and

660
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,272
the capital of China, you

661
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,007
cannot kill the spirit of

662
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,008
San Mar...

663
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,009
>> PAM: Aww.

664
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,010
>> CHERLENE: Lame.

665
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:55,111
As in who cares.

666
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,780
>> MALORY: The United States.

667
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,014
Apparently Calderon is barely

668
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,048
clinging to power.

669
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,049
>> ARCHER: Huh.

670
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,017
You think this is somehow

671
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,018
related?

672
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,052
(chuckles)

673
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm kidding, obviously.

674
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,021
>> RAY: Are you?

675
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,055
>> PAM: Yeah, right.

676
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,023
>> LANA: I don't think you are.

677
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,057
>> ARCHER: Yes, I'm kidding.

678
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,192
Because you want to know what I

679
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,193
really think is going on here?

680
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:11,895
>> CHERLENE: You're all jealous!

681
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:13,396
My album's coming out, and it's

682
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,764
gonna be huge, and you're all

683
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,032
jealous, and so you just want

684
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,066
to ruin it for me.

685
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,101
>> MALORY: Why would <i>I</i> want to

686
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,402
ruin your album?

687
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:21,771
I get 50% of the profits.

688
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,772
>> LANA: Archer?

689
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,073
>> ARCHER: I don't know, maybe

690
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:25,208
a little jealous.

691
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,209
It's an exciting time for her.

692
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,243
>> LANA: This.

693
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,545
Still talking about this.

694
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,546
>> ARCHER: Oh, right, right,

695
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,580
right.

696
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:31,581
So what I think is...

697
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,549
>> MALORY: I think you've

698
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,050
managed to stumble backwards

699
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,452
into a CIA-backed,

700
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,453
anti-Communist,

701
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,922
drugs-for-arms operation.

702
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:39,923
>> ARCHER: Wow, that actually

703
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:40,924
makes more sense.

704
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:41,891
>> LANA: Than...?

705
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:42,959
>> ARCHER: No, no, let's just go

706
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:43,927
with her thing.

707
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:44,961
>> CYRIL: Which, if it's true,

708
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:45,962
is...

709
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,930
>> MALORY: Wonderful.

710
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:47,964
>> CYRIL: I was going to say

711
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:48,932
terrible.

712
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:49,966
>> MALORY: Because you are a

713
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,934
timid man, Cyril.

714
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,769
>> CYRIL: What? No, I'm not.

715
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:53,903
>> PAM (laughing): Dude, your

716
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:55,939
balls are made of pussy.

717
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,474
(Archer laughs)

718
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,976
>> ARCHER: Aah! Ow. Oh.

719
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,244
All kidding aside, I maybe

720
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,445
should go to a hospital.

721
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:03,847
>> MALORY: Cyril, this is an

722
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,281
opportunity to finally make

723
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:06,249
some money.

724
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:07,484
Even if we had a buyer for the

725
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,818
cocaine, do we even still have

726
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,821
half of it left?

727
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,089
>> KRIEGER: Eh...

728
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,123
>> MALORY: What?

729
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,258
>> KRIEGER: It's, um, you know,

730
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,292
not... It's...

731
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,293
>> MALORY: Krieger!

732
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,294
>> KRIEGER: Mm?

733
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,329
>> MALORY: Tell me what's going

734
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,363
on or I will literally

735
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,098
emasculate you.

736
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,266
>> KRIEGER: Well, no, if you

737
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,868
literally emas... (coughs)

738
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,836
Okay, so, for a few weeks, I've

739
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,471
been working on a bit of a side

740
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:29,639
project.

741
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,141
I give you...

742
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,978
the    <i>Red Kriegtober.</i>

743
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,012
>> LANA: Um...

744
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,013
>> KRIEGER: Or the <i>Red</i>

745
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,014
 <i>OctKrieger.</i>

746
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,048
I can't decide.

747
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,316
It's a narco-sub.

748
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,818
For transporting cocaine.

749
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,952
It's totally undetectable by

750
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,020
the Coast Guard.

751
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,021
Thoughts?

752
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:45,989
>> LANA: How you gonna get it

753
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,056
out of here?

754
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:47,957
>> KRIEGER: Hm?

755
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,292
>> LANA: How does that thing

756
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:53,162
leave this room?

757
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:54,998
>> KRIEGER: Goddamn it!

758
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,999
>> MALORY: Oh, for the...

759
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,400
How much money did you waste on

760
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,868
that little boondoggle?

761
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,069
>> KRIEGER: Well, it's not <i>that</i>

762
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,170
so much as...

763
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:02,338
>> MALORY: Krieger?

764
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,506
>> KRIEGER: Well, I needed

765
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,141
ballast, and what better to

766
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,976
simulate bricks of cocaine than,

767
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,578
you know, bricks of cocaine?

768
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,846
>> MALORY: Krieger...

769
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,014
>> KRIEGER: And when I realized

770
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:12,549
it would never feel the wind on

771
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,051
its face, or taste the salty

772
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,154
spray of the sea, I... I...

773
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,057
(explosions)

774
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,559
>> MALORY: You what?

775
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,027
>> KRIEGER: I blew it up!

776
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,062
Goddamn you all to hell, I blew

777
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,063
it up!

778
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,197
(all exclaiming)

779
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,532
>> CHERLENE: I'm not cleaning it

780
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:30,533
up.

781
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,001
>> PAM: You mean it's all gone?

782
00:18:32,003 --> 00:18:33,069
>> KRIEGER: I... (sniffles)

783
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,538
No, no, not all of it.

784
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,042
(Pam sobbing)

785
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:40,543
>> PAM: Why?

786
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:41,511
>> KRIEGER: Shh, shh, shh, shh,

787
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:43,079
shh, shh, shh.

788
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,380
There, there.

789
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,548
>> MALORY: Woodhouse, dear, I

790
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,183
need some more ice.

791
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,518
>> WOODHOUSE: Straightaway, mum.

792
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,019
>> MALORY: Oh, and a small bowl,

793
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,120
a mirror, a needle and thread,

794
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,121
and a straight razor.

795
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,122
>> CYRIL: Whoa.

796
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,090
>> RAY: Just calm down.

797
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,091
>> ARCHER: Whoa, whoa...

798
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,192
>> LANA: You're not emasculating

799
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:57,226
Krieger.

800
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,227
>> KRIEGER: What the hell was

801
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,195
the mirror for?

802
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:00,229
>> MALORY: So you could watch.

803
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,230
(thunder rumbles)

804
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,365
(Krieger squeaks)

805
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,067
(Malory sighs)

806
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:05,568
>> MALORY: The perfect ending

807
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,370
to the perfect...

808
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,371
(laughs)

809
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,907
I almost said "evening."

810
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:11,908
More like months, though,

811
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,909
isn't it?

812
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,077
Since we started scrabbling for

813
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,578
coins because the damn

814
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,615
government took away our...

815
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,616
everything.

816
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,417
They took everything.

817
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,418
And the only thing that was

818
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,220
left, you idiots either lost,

819
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:27,323
gave away, ate or just blew up

820
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,292
and sank.

821
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,259
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Krieger.

822
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:31,260
>> LANA: Archer.

823
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,395
>> MALORY: And so, starting now,

824
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,896
in addition to the country

825
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:36,633
music business, which...

826
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,434
>> CHERLENE: Right?

827
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,602
>> MALORY: We are in the arms

828
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,603
business.

829
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:41,571
>> KRIEGER: There's still a

830
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,106
little cocaine left.

831
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:44,107
>> LANA: Krieger.

832
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:45,108
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Krieger.

833
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,075
>> LANA: And do we want to talk

834
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:47,110
about this or...

835
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,277
>> MALORY: <i>You're</i> welcome to.

836
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,779
I, personally, am going to bed.

837
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:52,015
It's been a long night.

838
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,516
>> ARCHER: Oh, yeah, wh-why are

839
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,484
you all dressed up?

840
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,518
>> MALORY: Well, not that it's

841
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,653
any of anyone's business, but I

842
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,654
had dinner with Ron.

843
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,688
>> ARCHER: What?

844
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,656
>> CHERLENE: Ooh.

845
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,657
>> CYRIL: Sounds delightful.

846
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,658
>> ARCHER: Wait-- you're still

847
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,959
getting divorced, right?

848
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:03,960
>> MALORY: No.

849
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:04,961
We have decided to give it

850
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:05,995
another chance, and so we will

851
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,963
be going to marriage counseling

852
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:07,964
and... (mumbles)

853
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:08,965
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?

854
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:09,999
>> PAM: Huh?

855
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,000
>> CYRIL: Marriage counseling

856
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,001
and what?

857
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,036
>> ARCHER: I didn't catch that.

858
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,137
>> MALORY: Oh, for...

859
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,638
We've decided to have an open

860
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,140
marriage.

861
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,141
>> CYRIL: Okay.

862
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,108
>> PAM: Nice.

863
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,109
>> KRIEGER: Gross.

864
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:21,277
>> CHERLENE: Oh, my God.

865
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,278
>> MALORY: Well, it was either

866
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,312
that or...

867
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,114
(phone rings)

868
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:26,549
>> CHERLENE (gasps): Oh, my God.

869
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,484
It's Ron.

870
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:29,519
Hello...

871
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,486
(all gasping)

872
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,487
>> ARCHER: Oh, no!

873
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:32,522
>> MALORY: And so...

874
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,489
>> ARCHER: Jesus.

875
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,557
Hope he doesn't call me.

876
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,558
>> LANA: Why would he call y...

877
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,162
(phone rings)

878
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:40,530
(Pam clears throat)

879
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,131
(clicks phone off)

880
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,032
