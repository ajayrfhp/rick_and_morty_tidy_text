to do would be

00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,747
To it.

159
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,252
Lana?
What?

160
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,821
Come on, it's like,
30 bucks a glass.

161
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,961
[lana]
so, if I understand

162
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,696
The situation correctly,

163
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,699
We're supposed to help
these terrorists who--

164
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,302
Well, you obviously
don't understand the situation

165
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,805
Because we're not terrorists.
We're freedom fighters.

166
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,873
They're the free wales army,
lana.

167
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,942
[speaking foreign language]

168
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
Oh yeah, that's-that's right,
dafydd, good lad.

169
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,312
Leg hurts.

170
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,714
Yes, it will do,
dafydd, you've been shot.

171
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,917
So, we're supposed to help
george and lennie here

172
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,886
Out of the country
because they're wanted by mi-5?

173
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,987
Yeah, that's what mother said.

174
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,457
Mi-5?
From England?

175
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,958
Our ally.

176
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,393
Well, they're no ally
to wales.

177
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,895
What are you--
it's the same country, lloyd.

178
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,930
[gasps]

179
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,732
Tell that to dyffryn ddibwys.

180
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,733
Duffer who?

181
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,135
Dyffryn ddibwys.

182
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,404
It was a town in wales
that had stood proudly

183
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,905
For a thousand years,

184
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,274
Until the saesneg,
the english,

185
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,909
Deliberately flooded it.

186
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,811
Oh, my god,
to drown everybody?

187
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,112
No, to make a reservoir.

188
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,081
They need water,
so they built a dam

189
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,250
And that flooded
dyffryn ddibwys,

190
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,352
And all the people
lost their homes.

191
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,921
My god,
countless thousands of them.

192
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,122
Well, 48.

193
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,425
Thousand?
No, just 48,
four dozen.

194
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,093
Are you--
still, though.

195
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,461
So, now they're all homeless?

196
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,130
Well, no,
they were compensated,

197
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,266
So they got
new houses somewhere else

198
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,268
And were, in many cases,
much nicer ones.

199
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,469
But, then what's the problem?

200
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,204
Who're you,
josephine stalin?

201
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,107
That shit
wouldn't happen in america.
Yes, it would,

202
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,176
And does all the time.

203
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,945
The tva has flooded
thousands of americans
out of their homes.

204
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,115
The what?
Tennessee valley authority?

205
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,783
Hmm?
[sighs]

206
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,051
Remembered  <i>deliverance?</i>

207
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,953
How the whole valley
was going to be flooded?

208
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,022
Lana,
I hate to break it to you,

209
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,323
I even hate to even say it
out loud,

210
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,126
But  <i>deliverance</i>
<i>was just a movie.</i>

211
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,296
Oh, my god.
So what exactly

212
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,131
Are you wanted
by mi-5 for?

213
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,500
We tried to blow up
a dam.

214
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,135
A dam?
What, to flood

215
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,803
A bunch of other people
out of their homes?

216
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,972
Well, not real people,
just english ones.

217
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,874
[inhales]
excuse me.

218
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,811
[scoffs]
christ, is she always
this angry?

219
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,980
She's not mad at you,
lloyd, she's mad at me.

220
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,416
For what?
Um, okay.

221
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,553
So I was engaged to this
smokin' hot russian woman...

222
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,555
[cyril]
lieutenant ginger bayliss.

223
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,257
Clamp.
Played by odessa cleveland.

224
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,826
Who later had
a guest spot as a nurse
on     <i>trapper john, m.D.</i>

225
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:22,894
What?

226
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,162
Starring pernell roberts

227
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,498
As the titular
trapper john somehow.

228
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,333
In a drama,
which was totally weird.

229
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,201
But not as weird
as ed asner.

230
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,070
Mary tyler moore's lou grant.

231
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,939
Playing lou grant
in the show  <i>lou grant,</i>

232
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,574
Which was also a drama.

233
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,275
[cheryl/carol]
okay, yeah,
but besides one nurse,

234
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,511
<i>Mash </i> didn't have
any black characters.

235
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,845
Actually,
it did have one.

236
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,014
And his name
was spearchucker.

237
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,551
[both] what?
Spearchucker jones.
[chuckling] I mean--

238
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,386
Okay, yeah,
maybe in the book

239
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,522
Or that crazy football movie,
but I'm talking about--

240
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,224
Yeah, the show,
on network television.

241
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,960
In america,
and not that long ago.

242
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,861
[lana]
but how is this even possible?

243
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,030
<i>[malory]</i>
<i>now, I know</i>
<i>it may seem strange.</i>

244
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,865
What,
aiding our ally's enemies?

245
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,434
Well, it makes sense.

246
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,869
When you're the biggest kid
in the school yard,

247
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,237
If your little friends
have a bully...

248
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,239
You want them to come
running to you.

249
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,041
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>And slater says--</i>

250
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,543
Wait,
you talked to slater?

251
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,980
Yes, lana, now obviously
I've spoken to slater.

252
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,482
And he says the cia
does this sort of thing

253
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,150
All the time, so...

254
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,419
So, did he say why he keeps
giving us these assignments

255
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,321
That always seem
to blow up in our faces?

256
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,224
No. Although,
speaking of blowing up--

257
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,993
Malory, she's a baby.

258
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,261
And she weighs exactly
as much as she's supposed to,

259
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,464
So you better be feeding her.

260
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,632
[dial tone]
I am!

261
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,467
It's just-- hello?
[beep]

262
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,969
[scoffs]
please.

263
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,904
As if I wouldn't feed you.

264
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,239
[fusses]

265
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,142
Now, who wants
a widdle ice chip?
[crying]

266
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,577
No?

267
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,946
I suppose you prefer
a nice big bottle

268
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,148
Of that liquid butter fat.

269
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,084
Goat,
I swear to christ,

270
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,487
I'll have your hide as boots
and the rest of you as a curry.

00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,921
Go on, shoo.

272
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,256
Shoo-- it.

00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,958
Shit, shit.

274
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,927
Oh shit, shit, shit,

275
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,462
[archer]
no shit, I'm telling you guys,

276
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,931
Katya looked
absolutely a-mazing.

277
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,969
The tiniest,
laciest lingerie

278
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,138
Sexy stiletto heels.

279
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,472
And a good body, eh?

280
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,941
Good?
I mean, you're from the u.K.,

281
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,443
So you don't have
anything to compare it to,

282
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,446
But no, lloyd,
not good, insane.

283

[moaning]
dafydd.

284
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,352
[archer] and she was like,
rubbing all over me.
[growls]

285
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,621
[lloyd]
but nothing happened?

00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,356
[archer]
no, nothing.

Well,
except for the goodbye kiss,

Oh, you little--

Lana, hey.
We were just...Not talking.

00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,572
Shut up.

294
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,707
Already was, so--

295
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,508
So, is it possible

296
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,977
You two were followed here
by mi-5?

297

[humming]
um...

298
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,184
...Yeah.
What?

00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,418
Yeah,
they're quite good.
Son of a--

300
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,653
Archer, passport.
What?

301
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,555
Why do you--
give me your passport!

302
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,190
Here.

303
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,726
Oh, for the love of--
randy randleman?

304
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,228
Yeah, randy grew up
on the wrong side of the tracks,

305
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,397
Ran with the bad crowd,
got in some trouble,

306
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,665
Went to juvie.

307
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,400
He worked
in the mess hall there,

308
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,402
Fell in love with cooking,
and so when he got out,

309
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,737
He went to culinary school.

310
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,739
And now he's got
two restaurants, lana,

311
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,407
One michelin star,

312
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,342
And a marriage
that's on the rocks.

313
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,578
He's here to go
balls deep on farm-to-table,

314
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,680
You know,
trying to get back to basics.
Archer!

315
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,582
Like that time
rocky went to russia.

316
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,684
[groaning]
just get in that
closet over there

317
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,385
And take lurch with you.
Dafydd.

318
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,553
Wait, he's the one
they're looking for,

319
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,055
Why am I
getting in the closet?

320
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,524
Because I said so!
How is your american accent?

321
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,292
[american accent]
um, I guess it's okay.

322
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,061
I mean, like, you know,
people are always,
like, you know--

323
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,696
Like, you know,
it's crap.

324
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,564
No, dude,
people really dig it.

325
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,099
[scoffs]
people from where?

326
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,534
Dude, quebec?

327
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,236
He's the one
who should be in the closet.

328
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,605
No, wait,
oh, hang on.

329
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,106
Lana,
why am I in the closet?

330
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,775
Because I said so.

331
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,710
I think this will
really help sell it.
[archer] what?

332
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,045
Randy doesn't wear
nerd goggles.

333
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,481
He's a culinary bad boy.
[knocking]

334
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,716
[bardsley]
open the door, please.

335
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,285
[stage whisper]
get in the closet.

336
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,053
I am getting in the closet

337
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,489
Because I choose to get
in the closet.

338
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,792
Come on, gort.
Dafydd.

339
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,729
Okay, randy,
follow my lead.

340
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,764
[clears throat]
yes?

341
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,166
Good afternoon.

342
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,501
My name is bardsley,
I'm with mi-5.

343
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,404
[gasps]
mi-5, my goodness.

344
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,274
Please, do come in.
What's the problem here?

345
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,742
Well,
the problem, mr.--

346
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,677
Randleman,
randy randle-man.

347
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,745
I'm an american.

348
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,246
Right.

349
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,415
Yeah, I'm here to learn
about farm tables.

350
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,583
I beg your pardon?

351
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,119
I thought it was dams.
Shh!

352
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,121
Come on, buddy.
Dafydd.

353
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,090
Farm-to-table,
he meant to say.

354
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,826
He's a chef.
An american chef.

355
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,196
He knows
you're american, honey.
[chuckles]

356
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,697
The reason I'm here--

357
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,333
We're searching
for welsh terrorists.

358
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,137
Welsh terrorists?
Is there even such a thing?

359
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,374
Yes, I'm afraid so.
The self-styled
free wales army.

360
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,343
[speaking foreign language]
shh!

361
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,811
[whispering]
if you stay really,
really quiet,

362
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,646
I will buy you a puppy

363
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,816
That you will probably
accidentally strangle.

364
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,785
And we have reason to believe
they're in the area

365
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,286
And that
one of them is wounded,

366
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,188
So we're canvassing
all the farms,

367
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,123
And when we saw
the damaged vehicle--

368
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,860
A bee flew in it.
And I crashed.

369
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,195
A bee.
Flew into a convertible?

370
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,865
Look, our marriage
is on the rocks,

371
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,401
And also I have
two michelin tires, so--

372
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:34,172
Right. May I just see your
passport again, please?
[lana clears throat]

373
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,240
Oh, good heavens.

374
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,507
Wow!

375
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,745
What the shit!
[aroused chuckling]

376
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:44,649
This is actually
why we're here in wales.

377
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,585
To try and save our marriage.

378
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:51,322
Oh my god, baby,
I-I think it's working.

379
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,496
[bardsley]
are you joking?
Or insane?

380
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,431
Do you really expect me
to believe

381
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,601
You came to wales
for a romantic getaway?

382
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,536
Easy, bro.
Wales is kickass!

383
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,872
Honey!
I do, because we did.

384
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,276
I mean, if this
weren't a romantic getaway,

385
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,844
Would I be doing...

386
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,680
...This?
[moaning]

387
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:16,848
What the shit?

388
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,850
[lana]
or this?
[glasses clinking]

389
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,289
[strained groaning]
closet rampage.

390
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,890
Right, then.

391
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,526
Obviously I made an extremely
embarrassing mistake, so--

392
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,929
[door crashing]
what the shit, lana?

393
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,397
Ah-ha!

394
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,532
Ah-ha, what?
Who is this man?

395
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,235
I'm--
wait, shit, who am I?

396
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,204
You're lloyd llewellyn,
if I don't miss my guess,

397
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,740
Which means your brother
dafydd can't be too far off.

398
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,809
In the closet,
jacking off in a hat.

399
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,877
Dafydd!
[dafydd]
no, I'm not.

400
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,245
Yes, you are!

401
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,414
And I'm not lloyd llewellyn.
He is.

402
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,882
Oh, archer!
Archer?

403
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,417
As in sterling archer?

404
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,885
Yes, you idiot.

405
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,587
What?
As in sterling archer
of the cia?

406
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,790
I mean, no you idiot,
I mean, I'm--

407
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,793
My god,
then you must be lana--

408
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,331
Way to go, randy.

409
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,232
[groans]
how is this randy's fault?

410
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,301
Oh, I'm sorry,
did someone else
just barge in here

411
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,503
Yelling their idiot head off
about being with the cia?

412
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,739
Oh, I don't know.
Was someone else making out

413
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,674
With frodo p. Gryffindor here

414
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,409
Just to make
someone else jealous?

415
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,411
Well, maybe now you know
how I feel.

416
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,313
Actually, I don't know
how you feel, lana,

417
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,649
Because I didn't
make out with katya.

418
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,918
Oh no?
You didn't jam your fat tongue

419
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Down her throat
on that goodbye kiss?

420
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,590
[gasps]
you were eavesdropping!
Yeah, I'm a spy.

421
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,692
Oh, right.
And I also heard you raving

422
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,761
About how insane
katya's body was.

423
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,530
Is! But not as insane
as your mind.

424
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,332
And her stilettos
and her lingerie

425
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,334
And her big, fat,
vibrating robot vagina!

426
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,836
And you're making my point
for me.

427
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,871
And-- how?

428
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,508
It's easy not to bang your ex
if she's got all frump-a-dump.

429
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,343
The fact that katya
is still crazy hot

430
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,278
Makes it all
the more commendable

431
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,715
I didn't bang her.
I'm sorry, I think one of us

432
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,284
Must have just
suffered a massive stroke.

433
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,786
Oh sorry, that's me,
just making toast.

434
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,287
[dafydd]
toast!

435
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,956
Yes, come and have
some toast, dafydd.

436
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,624
Make him wash
his hands first.

437
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,459
Okay, so,
what do we do about this?

438
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,495
Well, apparently since
we're seeing other people now,

439
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,729
[lloyd]
oh?
Not you.

440
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,298
Not us.
I meant sleepy floyd here.

441
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,034
Right, shit,
he knows we're with the cia

442
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,468
Thanks to your fat mouth.

443
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,804
Well, it was
your fat mouth all over him

444
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,339
That started this whole thing.

445
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,408
Here, both of you,
get your fat mouths

446
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,977
Around some hot,
crispy toast.
[dafydd] toast!

447
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,012
Damn it, dafydd,
come and have some toast.

448
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,714
It's obvious what
we have to do with him.

449
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,015
[munching on toast]

450
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,517
Shoot him.
What?

451
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,318
We're not
shooting an mi-5 agent.

452
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,521
That's like shooting a cow.

453
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,724
How is that like--
lana, cows are our friends.

454
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,692
They may even be
our best friends.

455
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:42,894
We have to shoot him.

456
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,662
If we don't,
downing street will know

457
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,898
The cia's bankrolling
the free wales army.

458
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,833
[dafydd speaking
foreign language]

459
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,368
Dafydd, come and have
the bloody toast,

460
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,536
Or I'm throwing it
in the bloody bin.

461
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,004
He does have a point, lana.

462
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,672
Yeah, I hate to waste
good toast.

463
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,408
We are not murdering
an mi-5 agent.

464
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,410
End of sentence,
end of discussion.

465
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,612
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do

466
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,914
Or say to change
your mind, lana?

467
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,382
Very.

468
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,851
Well, then,
can you hold the toast?

469
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,453
- Damn it!
- Lloyd?

470
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,854
Yeah, grabbed it
while you were arguing.

471
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,355
You never read
rosenberg's writings

472
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,523
On nonviolent communication?

473
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,958
No.
Nope.

474
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,526
It really
helped me and dafydd.

475
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,061
Well,
maybe we'll check that out.

476
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,596
Eh, don't bother.

477
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,631
Because before
I shoot this mi-5 asshole,

478
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm gonna have to shoot
the both of you.

479
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,368
Wait, what?
Oh, don't worry,

480
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,770
We'll always have--

481
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,739
Do you think
he was going to say "table"?

482
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,709
I think probably wales.
[dafydd]
lloyd!

483
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,412
So, that's a problem.
[growls]

484
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,913
Nope,
that is your problem.

485
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,748
Then may I have the gun,
please?

486
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,784
[growling continues]
no.

487
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,986
Oh, my god,
you are so immature.

488
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,489
And you are so...

489
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,724
...Big.

490
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,460
[light chuckle]
this is going to be all,
dan'l boone.

491
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,395
[roars]

492
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,397
Alrighty,
I think that's got it.

493
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,099
Nurse, would you close
for me?

494
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,401
You already did that,
doctor.

495
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,737
Oh, right. Well then,
would you open for me?

496
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,406
God damn it,
stop sexually harassing me!

497
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,574
Sorry.
[scoffs]

498
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,409
Jesus.
Seriously.

499
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,644
Come on, tinker toy,

500
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,746
Let's go pound
some homemade gin.

501
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,581
So, wait,
how did we get to talking about

502
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,583
African-american characters
on     <i>mash?</i>

503
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,619
Well, the  <i>mash </i> connection
is obvious,

504
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,587
Perhaps even painfully so,

505
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:21,959
But the
africian-american thing?
Nope, no idea.

506
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,594
[archer]
but all things considered,

507
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,930
That went about
as well as could be expected.

508
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,965
Oh yeah?
Which part?

509
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,635
Leaving two welsh terrorists
basically at large

510
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,770
Or kidnapping an mi-5 agent?

511
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,106
Well, first of all, both.
How--

512
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,708
And second of all,
I was talking about
our argument

513
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,445
And how now you realize
you overreacted about katya.

514
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,714
I-- oh, my god.

515
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,951
Admit it, lana.
I admit nothing.

516
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,887
Although,
I do think we both learned

517
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,858
That trust is important
and, I don't know, whatever.

518
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,194
Trust.
Is that the best
I'm going to get out of you?

519
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,995
Yup, by far.

520
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,464
Well, then I accept
your non-apology.

521
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,899
And?

522
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,569
Oh, my god, and I promise
to try not to get into

523
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,470
Compromising situations
with other women.

524
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,972
Best I can do.

525
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,208
Well, then let's just get
this limey bastard

526
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,644
On that cia plane and let
slater worry about the blowback.

527
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,213
You don't think
they'll kill him, do you?

528
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,482
No, then they'll have
to kill us.

529
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,219
But before we go back
to the states...

530
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,487
Archer,
I am not driving to scotland

531
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,189
With a kidnapped mi-5 agent
in the back

532
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,991
Just to visit
a stupid distillery.

533
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,793
It's not stupid,
lana, it's...

534
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,830
Although you're right,
it's probably not

535
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,565
The smartest idea
I ever had.

536
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,067
Hmm, what is?

537
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,835
Oh, my god,
I'm glad you asked.

538
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,871
Okay, so, you put giant magnets
on the bumper of all the cars

539
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,674
So that every car
repels every other car,

540
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,010
So there would never be
any accidents.

541
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,179
Except every single time
you're at a red light,

542
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,615
And a car comes and bounces
you out into the intersection

543
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,750
And then you get
the shit t-boned out of you.

544
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,088
Thanks for the tampons.

545
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,092
