Latest intel, then tell rodney
they need travel documents

An hour ago...

00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,043
Then bring me the file I asked

Gillette: Why don't I shove a
broom up my ass and sweep the

00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,846
Floor while I'm at it?

00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:14,513
Malory: What was that?!

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:14,513
Gillette: Nothing.

9
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,349
Malory: Good. Saves you the
embarrassment of an incredibly

10
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,051
Homophobic remark.

11
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,386
Cheryl/carol: Aww.

12
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:20,853
Gillette: Ew!

Gillette: Ow!

Gillette (o.S.): Sorry!

00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:42,007
Malory: -- Electromagnetic
lock installed, are you serious?

23
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,076
Lana: Malory
malory: Because I'm seriously

him to see "the wiz."

Krieger: Jazz hands!

00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,509
Malory: Nothing! Is going on,
lana! If there were, I would

Tell you, but -

cardinal corelli on line one

00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,215
For you? Something about a
radical faction of the swiss

Taking the holy orders.

Corelli: Malory. We don't have
much time. Your agents of isis,

72
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,549
They are ready?

Lana: Or they are confused
verging on angry?

74
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,988
Malory: Lana, it's an
undercover mission. At the

75
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:09,988
Vatican?

76
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,393
Lana: What, they don't have
black nuns? Although granted

77
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:18,830
I've never seen one. But that's
not like, a rule, is it?

00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:18,830
Corelli: Ehh...

79
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,201
Lana: Well since you're not
sending me, and I assume you're

00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,869
Not sending ray...

81
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,004
Malory: To the vatican? You
think all those catholic

82
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:30,842
Priests wouldn't peg him -
[cough, cough] as american?

With that hillbilly accent?

Corelli: Malory, I must go
now. Please hurry!

85

Archer: In nomine patris, et
filii, et spiritus sancti, et

88
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:49,761
Cetera, et -
lana: You can't.

89
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,897
No one is gonna believe
archer is a priest.

90
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,166
Archer: For your infor - I'm
in! Turn it off!

91
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,067
Cheryl/carol (o.S.): Okay!

92
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,868
Jesus! [gasp] shit.

93
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,004
Archer: For your information,
lana, I have totally prepared

94
00:03:59,006 --> 00:03:59,004
For this mission.

95
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,673
Lana: Well there's a firs -
archer: First thing I did was

96
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,576
Watch every episode of "lucy,
daughter of the devil." which

97
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,279
By the way, was grossly -
lana: Inadequate preparation,

98
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,581
For an undercover mission
protecting the pope from an

99
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,016
Assassination attempt!

100
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,018
Archer: I was gonna say
"underrated," but -

101
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,953
Lana: But even if you were
prepared -

102
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,288
Archer: Which I truly feel
that I am.

103
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290
Lana: -- But which you're not,
who's your backup if ray's not

104
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,092
Going? Cyril?

105
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:20,092
Archer: No...

106
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,762
Malory: No, it turns out cyril -
cyril: Aaagh!

107
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,197
How bout a little warning?!

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,766
Malory: Has a thing. About
church stuff.

109
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:27,766
Lana: Since when?

110
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,736
Cyril: Since none of your
beeswax, and -

111
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:31,303
Archer: Bwoohahaahaaa!

112
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:31,970
Cyril: Aaagh!

113
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,872
Lana: Well...

114
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,644
Cyril: And I think I need a
spanking, because I have been a

115
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:44,416
Very naughty baaaaagh!

116
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,085
Lana: Guess that explains
that. But it doesn't explain

117
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,254
How archer's gonna run this
mission by himself.

118
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,457
Malory: Well, if you were
"confused verging on angry"

119
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,425
Before...

120
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,092
Cyril (o.S.): Aaagh!

Pam (o.S.): What?!

122
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,430
Pam: Jesus christ... Shit. God
damn it.

123
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,231
Malory: Pam!

124
00:04:59,233 --> 00:04:59,931
Pam: What.

125
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,599
Lana: Pam?!

126
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,433
Pam: What?!

127
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,000
Archer: Paaaam!

128
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,503
Pam: Whaaat?!

129
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,406
Archer: I dunno, what're we
doing?

130
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,741
Lana: Esatto! Che cosa stiamo
facendo?!

131
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,843
Pam: Aww man, we have to learn
latin?

132
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,745
Archer: Ew yeah, that's a
dealbreaker.

133
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,114
Lana: You were speaking latin
when you walked in here -

134
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:16,114
Archer: Mmmmno...

135
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,918
Lana: -- Whereas I was just
speaking italian, which neither

136
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,088
Of you speak nor even
understand, obviously, so -

137
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,157
Archer: So?! Lana, the
assassination plot is being

138
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,192
Hatched by the swiss guard?

139
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,493
Lana: So...?

140
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,495
Archer: So it's an eight-hour
flight, so we get some tapes

141
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,864
And brush up on our -
lana: Swiss?

142
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:32,864
Archer: Duh?

143
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,001
Lana: Well, since swiss isn't
a language, maybe you should

144
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,504
Get some tapes on german,
french, italian and romansh.

145
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,706
Archer: Maybe I will.

146
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,774
Malory: Alright. Lana pack a
bag, you're -

147
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,543
Archer: No! Mother come on, we
don't need -

148
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,478
Malory: Lana! Is going!

149
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,478
Lana: Ha!

150
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,614
Malory: And pam, if you keep
your eyes open and your big

151
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,617
Mouth shut, you just might
learn something from her.

152
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,385
Pam: Ha!

153
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,853
Archer: Why are you going ha?!

154
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,221
Pam: I dunno, what're we doing?

155
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,990
Lana: I'll tell you what we
should be doing. So, who does

156
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,159
The pope remind you of?

157
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,194
Malory: Ha!

158
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,061
Archer: What.

159
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,029
Lana: Haaa!

160
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,165
Archer: Shut up! And you also
shut up.

161
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,233
Woodhouse: Yessir.

162
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:08,233
Pam: Haaa!

163
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,203
Archer: Why are you still
going ha?!

164
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,205
Pam: Pink panther's on.

165
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,874
Father guido sardoochbag.?

166
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,247
Archer (o.S.): Oh really?

167
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,716
Archer: Because she didn't
specify an agent in-command,

168
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,252
Lana, so I would argue -
lana (o.S.): With a fence post.

169
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,255
Archer: I wouldn't argue with
a -- oof! Move, idiot!

170
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,690
Pam: I'm goin as fast as I can!

171
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,658
Archer: Not you, the -
pam: The fence post?

172
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:33,658
Lana (o.S.): Ha!

173
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,995
Archer: It was a bollard! And
my point was -

174
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,664
Lana: Fine! You're agent-in-
command! Now shut up, brief

175
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,867
Corelli, and get the access
code to the pope's apartment!

176
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,836
[doot]
archer: I... Will, because I

177
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,204
Command me to.

178
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,407
Lana: And you should eat, this
could be a long night, and

179
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,342
You're... So teeny.

180
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:50,342
Woodhouse: Hm?

181
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:54,279
Lana: Seriously, eat, you're
like a slow loris.

182
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,782
Woodhouse: Oh, no, bit off my
feed, I'm afraid.

183
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:00,419
Lana: Woodhouse, you need to -
oh c'mon, you need to fix?

184
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,853
Woodhouse: [whimper]
lana: Well, is there some

185
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,556
Amount you can shoot up to get
right for the mission, without

186
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,125
Gettin all... Trainspotty?

187
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:07,125
Woodhouse: Back in a tick!

188
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,363
Lana: Oh for the -- and thanks
for making me carry your bag

189
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,531
Through customs!

190
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,433
Woodhouse (o.S.): No, thank
you!

191
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,434
Archer (o.S.): Grazie.

192
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,570
Grazie mille,
vostra... Majesty-o?

193
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,807
Corelli: Your italian is, how
you say, shit?

194
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,942
Archer: Then you are not gonna
like my romansh.

195
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,378
Corelli: Mio dio! You think
this is funny?!

196
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,746
Archer: I thought that was.

197
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,781
Corelli: Assassins plan to
kill the holy father in his own

198
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,719
Bed, on this very night, ma tu
stai qui con la testa nel culo!

199
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,789
Pam: Whoa whoa, take it down a
notch, st. Louis! His head is

200
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,990
Not up his ass!

201
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,592
Archer: How'd you know what
he said?

202
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,827
Pam: It was an eight-hour
flight.

203
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,595
Archer: Wow, did you learn
romansh?

204
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,331
Pam: Who am I, cypher? The
gayest x-man?

205
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,134
Archer: I dunno, gambit looks
like he knows his way around a

206
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,402
Pair of -
corelli: Basta! Here is the

207
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,738
Access card to the holy
father's private apartment. I

208
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,808
Assume you have a plan once
inside?

209
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,744
Pam: We call it the old
switcheroo.

210
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,513
Archer: We absolutely do not
call it the old switcheroo.

211
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,782
Corelli: Mio dio!

212
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,784
Lesser cardinals: [gasp]
archer: I know, right? Trope

213
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,486
Alert!

214
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,620
Corelli: Che?

215
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:13,191
Pam: Eh... Non si traduce bene.

216
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,259
Lana: Feeling better?

217
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,862
Woodhouse: Sound as a pound,
my dear.

218
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,663
Where the hell are we?

219
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,833
Lana: Uh, this new place
called Italy?

220
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,835
Woodhouse: How'd I get all the
way downtown?

221
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,303
Lana: Wh-? Not little Italy!

222
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,671
Italy, Italy!

223
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,007
Woodhouse: Bloody hell. What
are we doing here?

224
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,709
Lana: Thwarting an
assassination attempt on the

225
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,879
Pope. Using you as a decoy.

226
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,881
Woodhouse: Back in a tick!

227
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,049
Lana: With ken and your weekend
weather. And you may need an

228
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,352
Umbrella because it's going to
be raining.

229
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,020
Dead ass popes.

230
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,689
Pam (o.S.): Aw crap, he's
already dead.

231
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,292
Archer: No he's not, he's just
old. That's how woodhouse looks

232
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,460
When he's asleep.

233
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,661
Pam: I'm gonna get a mirror.

234
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,063
Archer: Right until he wakes
and sees me staring at him

235
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:56,067
With night-vision goggles and
literally pisses himself. Hey,

236
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,336
Does woodhouse seem unhappy to
you, or -- what the hell're you

237
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:58,336
Doing?!

238
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:02,040
Pam: Gonna see if his breath
fogs it up.

239
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,742
Archer: Put the stupid mirror
back, he's not -

240
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,979
Pam: [gasp]
archer: Dead. Nice job, oliver

241
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,914
Cromwell.

242
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:08,914
Pam: I killed the pope!

243
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,583
Archer: Yeah, that's why I
said oliver crom -

244
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:15,420
Pam: Jesus christ I'm going to
hell I'm going to hell I'm

245
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,355
Going to hell I'm -
[thwak! Thwak! Thwak!]

246
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,023
Archer: Pam.

247
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,925
Pam: Yes?

248
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,028
Archer: Get off the pope.

249
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,431
Archer: Heeey,
your holiness...

250
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:26,431
Pam: Is he dead?!

251
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,934
Archer: I dunno, shut up, I'm -
pam: Should I get another

252
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,037
Mirror? But like, a much much
smaller one?

253
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,205
Lana (o.S.): No, you're half
heroin already!

254
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,840
[clunk]
lana: Okay, here's junkie

255
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,776
Brewster, let's...

256
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:38,843
Where's the pope?

257
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,045
Archer: Soo, here's the thing.

258
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,379
Pam: Promise you won't get mad?

259
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,682
Lana: I -- actually
do not promise I won't get mad,

260
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,883
Because here's what thing?

261
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,051
Archer: Um...

262
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,853
Lana: What, why is there a
giant mirror on the oh my god

263
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,288
You crushed the pope?!

264
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,724
Lana: Don't just stand there
idiots, help me get it off and

265
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,892
Pam! Woodhouse!

266
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,960
Pam: Huh? Oh!

267
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:55,860
Woodhouse (o.S.): Oof!

268
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:56,962
Woodhouse (o.S.): Ow!

269
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,731
Pam: Ow! What the -- is
that a needle?!

270
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,866
Archer: [chuckles]
lana: Rrrrrgh!

271
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,234
Pope: [gasping]
lana: Oh thank god!

272
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,971
Pope: Chi siete voi, dove sono
le guardie?!

273
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,440
Lana: We're -- your holiness,
do you speak english?

274
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,309
Pope: Yes, of course, but -
archer: Ha! Way to waste your

275
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,378
Time learning italian, pam!

276
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,382
Pam: Aw, stai zitto, testa di
cazzo. And could you...?

277
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,650
Woodhouse: Sorry.

278
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,252
Pope: Dio mio! He look just
like me!

279
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,455
Lana: Yes, your holiness, he's
a decoy. We have reason to

280
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,991
Believe a faction of the swiss
guard will make an attempt on

281
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,293
Your life tonight, so -
archer: So if you don't mind

282
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,795
Hopping out of those pope-
jamas...

283
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,798
Lana: Archer? We'll hide you,
put him in your place, wait for

284
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,734
Them to come in -
pope: And then what?! You are

285
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,901
Only two!

286
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,604
Archer: Well three, so -
pam: Better make that two.

287
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,407
Think I mighta grabbed the tail
of the dragon here...

288
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,676
Woodhouse: Ooh, then you're in
for a treat!

289
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,345
Archer: Shut up! And with all
due respect your holiness,

290
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,747
It's the swiss guard...

291
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,416
I think we can
handle a few court jesters

292
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,018
With, whatever, halberds.

293
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,987
Lana: Which, you realize are
just ceremonial.

294
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,523
Archer: Obviously they're
ceremonial, they were made

295
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,191
Obsolete by the arquebus.

296
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,994
Lana: Which is why now they
use mp-5's.

297
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:02,994
Archer: Oh.

298
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,031
Lana: Which is why where's the
gear bag with all of our

299
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,465
Automatic weapons?!

300
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,134
Archer: Well I assume in the
hotel room, but -

301
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,869
Lana: God -
archer: I thought they just

302
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:10,869
Had halberds!

303
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,638
Lana: Do you at least have a
sidearm?!

304
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,273
Archer: It was ruining the
lines of my cassock.

305
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:15,273
Lana: Dammit!

306
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,209
Archer: And again, I honestly
thought they just had -

307
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,012
[rattle rattle]
archer: -- Halberds. Although

308
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,515
Technically I think they're
called voulges.

309
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,983
Swiss guard (o.S.): Santo
padre! La porta, per favore!

310
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,819
Pam: I got him, just toss him

311
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,188
Lana: I'm not tossing the
frickin pope!

312
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,057
Archer: Somehow this is all
your fault.

313
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,058
Pope: Che?

314
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,627
Archer: Oh for the -- this is
the pope!

315
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,495
Lana: Oh, then
woodhouse (o.S.) [yelp]

316
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:37,495
Woodhouse (o.S.): Oof!

317
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,832
Pam: Ow! Oh for shit's sake,
already!

318
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,634
Archer: [chuckles]
lana: Archer shut up and find

Swiss guard: Sparale!

321
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:48,973
[brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrpt!]
lana: Oof! Transport! Are you

322
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:48,973
Shitting me?!

323
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,143
Archer: Well it was this or
the vespas! It's not my fault

324
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:56,014
Italy's so gay. Which, by the
way, pope, on the gay thing...

325
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:59,317
Pope: La sacra bibbia says it
is a mortal sin. But get me out

326
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,487
Of here alive and I will pardon
you for it, my son.

327
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,757
Archer: Wh-? No, I -
pam: Haaaa!

328
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,597
Cheryl/carol (o.S.): So why
are you scared of church stuff?

329
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,365
Did the unspeakable happen?

330
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,736
To your slender, hairless,
adolescent body?

331
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,237
Cyril: Wh-? No!

332
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,171
Cheryl/carol: Aww...

333
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:20,739
Cyril: Eww!

334
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:20,739
Cheryl/carol: Right?!

335
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,743
Cyril: First of all, I'm not -
I'm not scared of priests or

336
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,377
Nuns or -
cheryl/carol: Bishops?

337
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,679
Cyril: No, I just --
cheryl/carol: Bishop the

338
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:27,679
Android from aliens?

339
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,750
Cyril: No! I told ms. Archer
that because I didn't wanna go

340
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,852
On another mission with the
world's worst colleague.

341
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,687
Cheryl/carol: Bishop the
android from aliens?

342
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,256
Cyril: Archer! You think he's
a dick here? On a mission he's

343
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,193
Ten times worse.

344
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,061
Cheryl/carol: That's impossible.

345
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,229
Archer (o.S.) oh really?!

346
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,433
Pam: Yes, really! A, I was a
race car driver! And b -

347
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:48,433
Lana: Archer.

348
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,268
Archer: Your holiness, a
little help?!

349
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,903
Pam: The pope could drive
better than you!

350
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,038
Pope: No no, io non guido.

351
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,273
Pam: Ugh, esatto?

352
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,441
Pope: (chuckling) oh, capito...

353
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,043
Archer: Why're you taking her
side?! She's lutheran!

354
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,613
Pope: Eh, luther had some
valid complaints.

355
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,614
Lana: Archer! Owwwww!

356
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,783
Lana: Drive the ffffffffrickin
car!

357
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,052
Archer: Okay, lana! What is
your problem?

358
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,421
Lana: Well there's you... And
also that.

359
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,457
Archer: Why aren't they on
horseback?!

360
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,626
Lana: Because why would they
be?!

361
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,396
Archer: Right, halberdsmen are
foot-soldiers.

362
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,399
Pope: Mi scusi, the bigger
question is, if they really are

363
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,067
The swiss guards...

364
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,069
Pam: Why are they wearing
swiss guard uniforms, driving a

365
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,771
Swiss guard car?!

366
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:26,771
Pope: Esatto.

367
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:31,743
Lana: Holy sh -- it's a false
flag operation! To make it look

368
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,244
Like the swiss guard!

369
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,314
Pope: Who told you I was to be
assassinated?

370
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,817
Archer: Cardinal corelli! He -
lana: He wouldn't, by any

371
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:43,621
Chance, be next in line for the
papacy, would he?

372
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,024
Pope: Well, there would be an
election -

373
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,759
Archer: Right, with the smudge-
pot...

374
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,128
Pope: -- But corelli would be
sure to win.

375
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,362
Lana: Pretty good motive.

376

Pam: (laughing) yeah, you must
make a shitlo -

Doing?!

380
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,342
Archer: I'm letting them catch
up!

381
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:04,342
Everybody: Why?!

382
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,646
Archer: Can I finish?! He
asked, agent-incommandingly!

383
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,850
Take the wheel and maintain
speed! Woodhouse, lighter!

384
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,185
Woodhouse: I'm only ninety
pounds wet, sir!

385
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,455
Archer: What? No you idiot,
your spoon-cooker!

386
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:17,455
Woodhouse: Oh right.

387

[brrrrrrrpt]
actually that was pretty good,

393

For you at least, but no, while
I do...

394
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,874
Shit, I had a pun about flares.

Pam: That's your plan?! So
hey, can I squeeze in a

Pam: Fine, I'll buy a damn
indulgence! Oh wait...

mafia?

465
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,623
Commander: (chuckle) the
camorra is like your mafia

466
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,624
Like...

467
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,559
Lana: Seal team six is like
the girl scouts.

468
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,294
Commander: Exactly.

469
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,463
Pam: So... Equally sexy?

470
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:12,830
Lana: Eww!

471
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,564
Pam: Oww!

472
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,732
Archer (o.S.): Oww!

473
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,503
Archer: But the real good
news, ow! Dick! Is that we

474
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,204
Saved the pope's life.

475
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,840
Commander: For which we are
grateful. However...

476
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,643
We cannot tell
these two apart, so...

477
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,713
Archer: So I actually have an
idea about that.

478
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,681
Lana: Is it take them both
home, see which one's a better

479
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,584
Butler, and give the other one
back to the catholic church?

480
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:33,584
Archer: Never mind.

481
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,821
Lana: Then why don't we leave
them both here until they come

482
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,158
To. I'm sure woodhouse never
gets a vacation.

483
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,427
Archer: Are you kidding? I
didn't even let him go to his

484
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,428
Brother's funeral.

485
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,095
Pam: What?!

486
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,664
Lana: Oh my -- you asshole!

487
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,532
Was he crushed?!

488
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,533
Archer: Probably woulda been.

489
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,234
If I'd told him about it.

490
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,671
Lana: Ugh. But wait, why did
corelli hire isis to prevent

491
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,206
The assassination?

492
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,708
Commander: To show the
cardinals he was trying to

493
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,945
Prevent it, all the while
assuming -

494
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,915
Lana: What, that we'd totally
bl-ow my god he assumed we'd

495
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,083
Totally blow it?!

496
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,020
Commander: Well... Isis has a
certain reputation.

497
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,589
Archer: Hey, whoa! Not cool,
payne stewart!

498
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,958
Lana: Oh, my god, if malory ever
hears about this -

499
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,226
Archer: Which she won't!

500
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,527
Because pam?!

501
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,428
Pam: What?

502
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,596
Archer: Promise you'll never
tell mother!

503
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:24,569
Pam: Okay, I promise! Swear to
god!

504
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,369
Malory (o.S.): What?!

505
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,537
Archer/lana (o.S.): Pam! Pam!

506
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,640
Pam (o.S.): Haaaaa!?

507
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:41,652
