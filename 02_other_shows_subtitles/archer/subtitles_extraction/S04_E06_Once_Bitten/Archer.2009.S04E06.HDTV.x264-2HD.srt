1
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:05,721
ARCHER: Rat Patrol!

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,690
God, that was killing me.

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:10,793
So yeah, these exact same jeeps,
only with fifty-cal machine guns

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,929
on the back, and the Rat
Patrol just tore ass all over

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,599
North Africa, hassling Rommel.

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:17,966
How did you never see that show?

7
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,636
GILLETTE: I was probably here,
digging this goddamn jeep outta

8
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:22,205
this goddamn sand!

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
ARCHER: Hey don't yell at me, I'm
not the idiot who got us stuck!

10
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:25,908
CYRIL: You were driving!

11
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:29,212
So yes, you are exactly the
idiot who got us stuck!

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,481
ARCHER: Well whatever, the Rat Patrol
drove through way deeper sand than this.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,216
GILLETTE: Ya know...

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,850
ARCHER: Although I think one guy's backstory
was that he'd been like, a bootlegger?

15
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:40,122
But Kentucky's not all sand-duney, so--
CYRIL: Can you at least get out

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,889
of the jeep?!

17
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,924
ARCHER: Yes.

18
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,192
GILLETTE: Well?!

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,093
ARCHER: Hang on?

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,261
[BELCHES]

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,931
But only because taking a dump on
Turkmenistan is on my bucket list.

22
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:50,633
CYRIL: A true citizen of the world.

23
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:51,467
ARCHER: Right?

24
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:52,602
I mean shut up?

25
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,371
Is... damn.

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,106
Okay, I guess this'll have to do.

27
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:57,854
GILLETTE: Noooop!

28
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,007
CYRIL: You're not using the map for that!

29
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,245
ARCHER: Hey, I'm not the idiot
who didn't -- I mean, I also

30
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,480
didn't think to bring toilet
paper, but I'm not, ya know...

31
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:05,381
GILLETTE: An idiot.

32
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,249
ARCHER: Exactly.

33
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,218
CYRIL: Right, because an idiot wouldn't
wipe his ass with our only map.

34
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:12,421
ARCHER: No, an idiot would wipe
his ass with our only compass.

35
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,156
GILLETTE: Wait, which is where?!

36
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:16,425
ARCHER: Who am I, Lewis and-or Clark?

37
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,126
CYRIL: Archer.

38
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:19,828
ARCHER: Well the last time I saw
it was on the bar in the Athens

39
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:21,731
airport, but --
GILLETTE: God damn it!

40
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,799
ARCHER: Yeah, I doubt it's still there.

41
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:24,600
CYRIL: [annoyed sigh]

42
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,535
ARCHER: A sticky-fingered
people, the Greeks.

43
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,137
GILLETTE: Well you're not! Using the map!

44
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:29,037
ARCHER: Okay!

45
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,574
Jesus...
CYRIL: Wh-?

46
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:33,108
Noooo no no no no!

47
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,411
ARCHER: Well it's this or the map, so...
GILLETTE: Great, we'll just tell

48
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,680
him his money's out in the
desert covered with shit.

49
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,815
ARCHER: There's still
ninety-five grand in the bag!

50
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:43,152
And if what's-his-name...
CYRIL: Gorbagun Gorbanguly.

51
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:43,819
ARCHER: Really?

52
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:44,654
CYRIL: Yes, really.

53
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,921
And you can have a hundred.

54
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:46,955
ARCHER: What?

55
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:51,059
Cyril, since what, Monday, I've
had nothing but ouzo and lamb.

56
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,095
C'mon, I need at least a thousand.

57
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,003
CYRIL: Three hundred.

58
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,598
ARCHER: Oh for -- eight hundred!

59
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,365
CYRIL: Five.

60
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,101
ARCHER: Seven!

61
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,771
CYRIL: Seven, and you dig out the jeep.

62
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,105
ARCHER: Okay, deal.

63
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,006
But I take the map.

64
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,808
CYRIL: No! We just went over --
ARCHER: To read!

65
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,178
Now c'mon, hurry up!

66
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,780
The lambs are screaming!

67
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,848
CYRIL: Hey be careful,
there might be snakes!

68
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,483
ARCHER: Not even gonna swing at that one.

69
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,451
CYRIL: Ha ha.

70
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,752
I'm talking about cobras.

71
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,487
ARCHER: What do you know
about cobras, Cyril?

72
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,723
CYRIL: I know the Caspian
cobra, which is indigenous to

73
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,826
Turkmenistan, is often light
brown with darker ventral bands.

74
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,929
ARCHER: Well goody, you win...
cobra-knowing.

75
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,831
GILLETTE: Dukes, it's gonna be dark soon.

76
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,832
How far is it?

77
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,402
CYRIL: I dunno, I need to look
at the -- God damn it, Archer!

78
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,238
ARCHER: What, I said I needed a thousand!

79
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:42,277
Bet three hundred bucks seems pretty
cheap for a map right about nyowwww!

80
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:47,883
So hey, so yeah, did you say light
brown with darker whateveral bands?

81
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:51,887
CYRIL: Ventral bands, on -- wait, why?

82
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:55,825
ARCHER: Eh.
Just curious.

LANA: Or how about just sexist

Please, we've talked about this,
it's not even eight-thirty.

00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,696
Let me get settled before you clomp
in here in one of your jealous snits.

00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,832
LANA: One of my -- wait, whoa, clomp?

91

MALORY: Yes, Lana, clomp, meaning--
LANA: I know what clomp means!

92
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,037
PAM: Your clompin' ass oughta know...
LANA: Wh-?

93
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,940
PAM: Seriously, I bet your
downstairs neighbors hate you.

94
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,208
LANA: For your information.

95
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,811
The Flatows are always
incredibly polite to me.

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,847
PAM: That's because the Flatows think
they live under a frickin AT-AT.

97
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,681
CHERYL/CAROL: Zhwizz-clonk!

Zhwizz-clonk!

Zhwizz --
LANA: Okay!

100
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:17,089
MALORY: Whereas this one, almost
impossibly light on her feet.

101
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,625
It's like... if you've ever
seen Jackie Gleason dance.

102
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,695
PAM: So, is that a compliment, or --
MALORY: I don't see how

103
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,529
it possibly could be.

104
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,563
PAM: Okay.

105
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,699
MALORY: Nor do I see how
you could possibly think

106
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,336
that you're at all suited to a
covert mission in Turkmenistan.

107
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,405
LANA: Why, because I'm black,
or because I'm a woman?

108
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:33,972
MALORY: Wh-?

109
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:34,840
Pick one!

00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,010
I mean look, I don't want
to sound racist, but --

111
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,812
LANA: But you're gonna power through it.

112
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,347
MALORY: Not about you,
about Turkmenistan!

113
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:46,418
Lana, this is a Central Asian,
maledominated, xenophobic

114
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:50,122
puppet-state whose dictator
changed the words for bread and

115
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,490
Friday to his dog's name.

116
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,292
CHERYL/CAROL: Gurpgork.

00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,328
MALORY: Yes, Gurpgor --
how did you know that?

118
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,263
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God
how did I know that?!

119
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,464
PAM: Okay.

120
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,367
MALORY: And all that crazy is
sitting on top of an ocean of

121
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,536
oil and natural gas.

122
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,539
Making this pipeline crucial
to the Russians, which is why

123
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:11,609
we're paying Gurbanguly to...
hinder construction.

124
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:15,047
LANA: Wh-? Wait, so now we're paying
people to blow up oil pipelines?!

125
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,615
MALORY: See? Another
reason I didn't send you.

126
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,084
LANA: What, the environment?!

127
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,685
MALORY: Of what, this litterbox?

128
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,020
Or Western Europe?

129
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,891
Because T-72 tanks aren't exactly
known for their low emissions.

130
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,161
LANA: I want it officially
on record that I am strongly

131
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,031
opposed to this mission.

132

MALORY: What record?

133
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,634

something in the newsletter?

You're not still doing that?!

00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,113
GILLETTE: Lorne Greene.

ARCHER: Wow.
GILLETTE: Yeah.

143
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,216
ARCHER: Bonanza or Battlestar?

GILLETTE: Duh.

145
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,053
So, I come to the Ponderosa
looking for ranch work, but my

chaps get torn and Hop Sing --
ARCHER: Ray?

147
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,359
Time's kind of a factor here.

148
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,060
GILLETTE: I am not. Ever.

149
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,762
Sucking your taint.

00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,165
ARCHER: Okay, so Cyril...
Better chapstick it up, buddy.

151
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,434
CYRIL: First of all, not only
does sucking out the venom not

152
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,703
help the snakebite victim,
it can also envenom the --

153

ARCHER: Taint-sucker,
that's you, let's go.

154
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,508
CYRIL: And second of all, the
venom's not there anymore, it's

155
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,710
pumping through your veins
to your heart and brain.

156
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,545
ARCHER: My -- well put
a tourniquet on me!

157
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,915
GILLETTE: You can't tourniquet the taint.

158
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,849
ARCHER: But -- wait is
my dick gonna be okay?!

159
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,819
CYRIL: Well the danger there is cytotoxins,
which can cause severe necrosis.

160
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,754
ARCHER: Nec -- so my
dick's gonna fall off?!

161
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,722
CYRIL: Maybe.

162
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,456
ARCHER: Aaagh!

163
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,458
CYRIL: But the bigger danger
is the neuro and cardiotoxins,

164
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,161
which can cause respiratory
failure, cardiac arrest --

165
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,432
ARCHER: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

166
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:44,502
CYRIL: So the most important
thing is for you to stay calm.

167
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,703
GILLETTE: Ew.

168
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,440
CYRIL: Oh boy...
ARCHER: What, that's good right?

169
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,142
If my body's throwing up the poison?

170
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,143
CYRIL: It might be.

171
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,510
If you had drunk it.

172
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,614
ARCHER: Jesus H. Thirst, speaking of...
Ray, back pocket down there, flask.

173
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,249
CYRIL: Wh-?

174
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,750
No, alcohol's a vasodilator!

175
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,421
It's the absolute worst possible
thing you can do for a snakebite!

176
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,621
ARCHER: Well maybe for regular people.

177
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,289
CYRIL: ...?!

178
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,291
ARCHER: Cyril, it's already full
of cobra venom, now's not the

179
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,794
time for any more chemical
changes to my blood!

180
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,863
CYRIL: Okay, give it to him.

181
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,666
ARCHER: Wh-? Gimme that!

182
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,101
GILLETTE: Here, baby.

183
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,202
ARCHER: It's half empty!

184
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:24,409
CYRIL: That's still way more than you--
ARCHER: Just shut up and -- Dig.

185
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,111
I'm not doing super great.

186
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,540
CYRIL: Well I could use some help!

187
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,581
ARCHER: I would, but I
can't feel my hands.

188
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:30,582
CYRIL: I meant Ray!

189
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,186
Who's just standing there...
Ray, dammit, on bionic legs!

190
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,013
GILLETTE: Oh right.

191
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,154
ARCHER: God damn it, Ray!

192
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,089
GILLETTE: I forgot!

193
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,224
ARCHER: How do you forget
you have bionic legs?!

194
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,028
GILLETTE: I, ya know, are you constantly
aware you have regular leg bones?!

195
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,176
No, you're --
ARCHER: Just pick up the goddamn jeep!

196
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,899
GILLETTE: He said, suddenly all...
pro-bionic.

197
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,468
Okay, on three.

198
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,671
One, two, threeaagh!

199
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,373
CYRIL: Ray?

200
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,640
ARCHER: What is that,
what're you doing?!

201
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,776
GILLETTE: My back my back my back my back...
ARCHER: Are you shitting me?!

202
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:03,915
Bionic legs, and you
lifted with your back?!

203
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,851
Cyril, my gun's in the gear bag,
could you hand it to me, please?

204
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,853
CYRIL: To... use as a signal?

205
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,122
ARCHER: Yeah, maybe.

206
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,824
If there's any bullets left
after I murder both of you.

207
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,392
CYRIL: Wh-?

208
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,393
Why me?!

209
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,162
ARCHER: It's number two
on my bucket list.

210
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,130
CYRIL: What's number one?

211
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,098
ARCHER: Going to one of those
things where they make some

212
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:25,799
record-breakingly huge kind of food, like
a frittata the size of a hockey rink.

213
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:31,192
And then eating a piece, and then
laughing, because I murdered you.

214
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:37,969
MALORY: Krieger, I need you
to -- Krieger, Krieger?

215
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,571
KRIEGER: Yep! Yep yep yep!

216
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,041
MALORY: Whatever unspeakable thing
you're doing back there can wait --

217
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,109
KRIEGER: Well, you say that...
MALORY: Yes I do, and I just

218
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:48,580
did, so come on, I need
you in the control room.

219
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,515
Because they should
have checked in by now.

220
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,884
So keep trying to reach them
on the sat-phone, and if that

221
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:56,988
doesn't work try to get satellite
photos on the next pass.

222
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:02,093
And not a word of this to
anyone, especially -- Lanaaa!

223
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,829
I thought I heard
self-righteous clomping.

224
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:05,797
Can I help you?

225
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:08,166
LANA: Funny, I was just
gonna ask you that.

226
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,401
MALORY: No, we're fine.

227
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,802
Aren't we, Krieger?

228
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:11,703
KRIEGER: Yes?

229
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,672
LANA: So, the mission?

230
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:14,706
Going as planned?

231
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:18,042
MALORY: Yes, as a matter of fact
they just this minute checked in.

232
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,444
All good.

233
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:21,979
LANA: Uh-huh.

234
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,014
MALORY: "Uh-huh."

235
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:28,186
Ugh, have you ever heard such
a superior, know-it-all tone?

236
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:29,987
KRIEGER: Oh, you're serious?

237
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:30,855
GILLETTE: Yes!

238
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:31,856
CYRIL: No!
GILLETTE: Cyril!

239
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:37,128
I can't move, Archer's... Oh.
Well, very nearly dead, so --

240
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,963
CYRIL: I'm not calling for an extraction!

241
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,266
GILLETTE: Look, just because
Lana makes you feel insecure in

242
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,901
your masculinity --
CYRIL: Mascu -- look who's talking!

243
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:47,672
GILLETTE: Oh for -- Cyril, when I
was ten years old I killed a bear.

244
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,541
CYRIL: Nuh-uh... really?

245
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:50,842
GILLETTE: With a bow.

246
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:53,745
And then Daddy made me take a
big ol' bite out of its heart.

247
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,012
CYRIL: Oh my God!

248
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,615
That is... horrible!

249
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,183
GILLETTE: No shit, I was
bawling my eyes out.

250
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:01,586
But he kept slapping me until I did it.

251
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:04,088
CYRIL: Jesus...
ARCHER: Seriously.

252
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:05,790
No wonder you're gay.

253
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:10,094
And Cyril if you call ISIS, I will
literally literally, murder you alright.

254
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:16,000
I'd rather die than sit through another
one of Lana's big "I told you so's."

255
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,228
At least you get to bang her.

256
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,903
GILLETTE: Well, you seem
to be feeling better.

257
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,171
ARCHER: Hang on.

258
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:26,978
Gay-vy Crockett, boom, nailed it.

259
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,813
But no, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.

260
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,483
GILLETTE: So since you're too pussy
to call for an extraction...

261
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,850
CYRIL: I'm digging, I'm digging!

262
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:33,918
ARCHER: Well wait, hang on.

263
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:37,322
Because unless I'm hallucinating...
There's a Landcruiser over there

264
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,057
flipping his highbeams at us.

265
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,826
BOTH: You're hallucinating.

266
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:42,594
ARCHER: Oh.

267
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:46,765
Well the good news is, we don't have
to worry about these alligators.

268
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:49,100
That's not actually good news, is it.

269
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:49,867
CYRIL: No.

270
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:52,203
No it is not.

271
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,307
ARCHER: Okay... later, gator!

272
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,514
JAMES MASON: No no no no no,
what is the meaning of this?!

273
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,215
ESCORT: I'm sorry, James Mason!

274
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,751
But he just won't stop
tooting that darn tooter!

275
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,987
JAMES MASON: Mr. Archer, I'm
afraid I must ask you to cease

276
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:14,359
your insufferable tooting--
This instant.

277
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,293
ARCHER: Fine by me.

278
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,361
I hate opera.

279
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:19,364
Almost as much as I hate hoodies,
what the hell's going on here?

280
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,666
JAMES MASON: Oh no, not hell,
Mr. Archer, this is --

281
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:23,368
ARCHER: Hey. Cut-rate James Mason.

282
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:25,737
I got kicked out of
Episcopal prep school.

283
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:26,404
Twice.

284
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:30,442
So if there is a heaven --
JAMES MASON: Oh, I'm sorry, nor is this heaven.

285
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,478
ARCHER: Well no, obviously it's not heaven --
JAMES MASON: No, it's a --

286
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:36,147
ARCHER: -- because Janis Joplin's
not giving me a rim job.

287
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,282
JAMES MASON: Way station,
I beg your pardon?

288
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,818
ARCHER: Right?

289
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:42,186
Sorry, a cobra bit my taint.

290
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,855
JAMES MASON: Yes.
ARCHER: I'm not myself.

291
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:44,956
JAMES MASON: Aren't you?

292
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,990
ARCHER: Are I?

293
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,759
JAMES MASON: Are you, indeed.

294
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:51,730
Would you like to know who
Sterling Archer really is?

295
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:52,897
ARCHER: No?

296
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,865
LANA: Why not?

297
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:57,369
Why won't you guys stand up to Malory
with me about blowing up the pipeline?

298
00:11:57,436 --> 00:12:00,472
PAM: Mmmmmmmmmmmcuz we don't give a shit?

299
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:01,906
LANA: About the earth?!

300
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:04,676
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh please, if you
really cared you'd resign, but

301
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,412
there's no way you ever will
because you're just counting

302
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,115
the days until, her face bloated
and yellow from liver failure,

303
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:14,051
she calls you to her deathbed
and, in a croaky whisper,

304
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,488
explains that Mr. Archer is
totally incompetent and that

305
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,790
you, the long-suffering
Lana Kane, are the only one

306
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:21,626
qualified to run ISIS, and you
weep shameful tears, because

307
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:28,232
you know this terrible place is the
only true love you will ever know.

308
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,234
LANA: Excuse me.

309
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:32,804
PAM: Daaamn...
CHERYL/CAROL: What?

310
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:36,708
Oh my God, was I talking?

311
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:39,911
CYRIL: Who the... hell is he...
talking to?

312
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,547
ARCHER: James Mason...
CYRIL: Oh.

313
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:43,882
GILLETTE: Maybe that's his Lorne Greene.

314
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,619
ARCHER: James Mason, why
are we in Baltimore?!

315
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,821
JAMES MASON: I thought you might
like some insight into how you

316
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,389
became the man you are.

317
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:52,457
ARCHER: No, I would absolutely

318
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:53,090
not like some --

319
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:54,325
JAMES MASON: Sterling Archer,
age eighteen..

320
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:58,730
ARCHER: The most recruited
prep school lacrosse player in America...

321
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:02,901
JAMES MASON: Visiting
Baltimore for the weekend, to decide if

322
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,270
he will accept a full athletic
scholarship to Johns Hopkins.

323
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:08,306
ARCHER: Whooooo!

324
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,142
Yeah, so we don't need to see how...
JAMES MASON: At a stop on the

325
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,145
train ride from New York you
struck out the major league

326
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:17,482
homerun champion, Slammer Sloan.

327
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,417
ARCHER: Whooooo!

328
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:23,287
ARCHER: Well obviously, I was awesome, but I--
JAMES MASON: Drew the attention

329
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:28,460
of a beautiful woman named
Ruth Ann Litzenberger... Qui tait, vraiment,

330
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:30,361
une femme fatale.

331
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:34,298
And who followed you here, to
this very hotel in Baltimore,

332
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:39,370
and sent you a note, to come to her room...
ARCHER: Look, seriously -- Woooooo!

333
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:43,307
Wait, how did you know I was
staying -- What's going on here?

334
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,009
RUTH ANN: Sterling?

335
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:49,280
Will you be the best there
ever was in the game?

336
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:50,147
ARCHER: Wh-?!

337
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,536
YOUNG ARCHER: Uh...
ARCHER: Noooo!

338
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,684
YOUNG ARCHER: Duh.

339
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,797
ARCHER: Yeah, sooo... I don't know if
you're deaf or just an asshole or both,

340
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:08,566
but I'm pretty sure I said
I didn't wanna see this.

341
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,302
JAMES MASON: But Sterling, do
you not see how the actions of

342
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,406
a deeply disturbed woman have
profoundly influenced your life?

343
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:16,608
ARCHER: Well obviously!

344
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:20,678
I mean -- Oh, you mean my lacrosse
career ending because a crazy stalker

345
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:21,980
gut-shot me.

346
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,047
JAMES MASON: Do I?

347
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:25,817
ARCHER: I don't know, James Mason!
Do you?!

348
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:28,486
Besides, what freakin' movie is this?

349
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,922
What's next, Mr. Gower slaps me deaf?!

350
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,757
C'mon, you're all over the road here!

351
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:33,224
CYRIL: Well?!

352
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,392
ARCHER: Well what?!

353
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:35,739
CYRIL: I'm doing the best I can!

354
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:38,329
GILLETTE: If that's the
best you can do -- gaagh!

355
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,230
Just kill your -- gaagh!

356
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,533
Wh-?

357
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,001
Are you bouncing on purpose?!

358
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:46,004
CYRIL: No, I'm trying to get
Archer to whatever passes for a

359
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,172
doctor around here before it's too late!

360
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,808
ARCHER: Sounds like a plan, James Mason.

361
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:55,279
CYRIL: And maybe if you shut up I can
concentrate on the rowaaaghhhhh!

362
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:56,548
GILLETTE: Gaagh!

363
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,282
What the shit was that?!

364
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,617
CYRIL: A camel.

365
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,219
GILLETTE: Well great, now we've
both killed a large animal!

366
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:03,387
Drive around it!

367
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:07,025
CYRIL: I, uh... don't
think that's an option.

368
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,701
ARCHER: Hey check it out, Fred and Barney,
we're at the Water Buffalo Lodge!

369
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,434
MALORY: Krieger, any word from Sterling?

370
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:22,035
KRIEGER: Yep!

371
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,169
Yep yep yep!

372
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:24,604
MALORY: Well?
What did they say?

373
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,806
KRIEGER: Oh.
I mean nope. Nope nope nope.

374
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:27,440
MALORY: [annoyed sigh]

375
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:30,176
KRIEGER: But, ya know,
I'm sure they're fine.

376
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:31,244
CYRIL: Wait, no!

377
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,445
I had the right of way!

378
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:33,246
GILLETTE: Gaagh!

379
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,715
GILLETTE: Seriously, I get that
you're upset but I think I have

380
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:38,852
a pinched nnngghhh!

381
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,753
GILLETTE: Gaaagh!

382
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,054
CYRIL: Now just a darn minute!

383
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:46,025
We're Americ -- Hello...
GILLETTE: Yeah.

384
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,493
Way to not call it in.

385
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:48,628
JAMES MASON: I beg your pardon?

386
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:49,796
ARCHER: Yeah, you should.

387
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,097
And I'm outta here.

388
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,932
JAMES MASON: I'm afraid
that isn't possible.

389
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,767
ARCHER: Oh really?

390
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,301
And why is --
AMBULANCE DRIVER: Comin through!

391
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:56,236
C'mon, make a hole!

392
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,737
YOUNG ARCHER: Phrasing, boom.

393
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:58,905
ARCHER: Boom.

394
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,907
Scholarship to Johns Hopkins.

395
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:01,656
JAMES MASON: Mmm.

396
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,746
Bit of a moot point though,
really, given your SAT scores.

397
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:07,974
ARCHER: Goodbye, James Mason.

398
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,383
JAMES MASON: No, you -- Mr. Archer, wait!

399
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,251
CYRIL: Please, here!

400
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:15,789
Here's forty-three hundred dollars,
surely that's enough for a camel.

401
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:19,092
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah, baksheesh!

402
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,696
CYRIL: Baksheesh, exactly, but our friend...
okay, snake is...

403
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:29,635
oh, okay, so "Our friend was bitten
by a snake" is... Ozum jora?

404
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:32,939

405
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,475
TURKMEN CHIEF: Etmek bishlemek gurpgork.

406
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:37,043
CYRIL: Wh-?

407
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:38,544
No, no!

408
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:40,313
I mean... Yok,yok.

409
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,681
JAMES MASON: No, no!

410
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,349
JAMES MASON: Mr. Archer, please!

411
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,651
ARCHER: You please, cut-rate James Mason!

412
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:50,456
And then shut up, because I'm going...
ARCHER: Home.

413
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,158
Goddammit.

414
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:53,592
Or... what is it?

415
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,694
CYRIL: Gurpgork!

416
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,728
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah!

417
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,997
Gowushmak eshek gurpgork!

418
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:58,397
CYRIL: Wh-?

419
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:58,965
No!

420
00:16:58,966 --> 00:16:59,632
Yok!

421
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,268
Not that Gurpgork!

422
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,370
(Makes claw, growls) Rawr, rawr!

423
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:05,438
TURKMEN CHIEF: Ah, Gurpgork!

424
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:07,173
Patysha alabai!

425
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,606
TURKMENI: Ah, Gurpgork!
Hawa hawa! Gurpgork!

426
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,344
TURKMEN CHIEF: Gurpgork.
CYRIL: [deeply weary sigh]

427
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:13,891
GILLETTE: How's it the same word
for bread and snake and Friday

428
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,114
and that damn dog?!

429
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:16,850
CYRIL: How the hell should I know?!

430
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:20,686
MALORY: Because you have an entire satellite
array at your disposal, you idiot!

431
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,256
KRIEGER: Yeah, I don't actually
know how any of this works.

432
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,758
MALORY: But --
KRIEGER: That was the fat guy, you killed.

433
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,994
LANA: Oh, and just so you know?

434
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:34,968
I do know what true love is, so... yeah.

435
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,536
MALORY: What in God's
name was that about?

436
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:41,074
KRIEGER: She'd probably ruin the wedding.

437
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,976
ARCHER: Come on, what the hell is this?

438
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,744
JAMES MASON: I thought you'd
like to see something.

439
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:48,714
ARCHER: I've seen poverty, I've been to...
oh, how's it going in Turkmenistan?

440
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,649
JAMES MASON: Mmmmm, not great.

441
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,018
TURKMENI [excited chattering]

442
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:53,920
GILLETTE: Cyril, just draw a snake!

443
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:54,720
CYRIL: Oh right.

444
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:59,192
CYRIL: Okay, uh... doo doo doo...
elliptical head, oblique dorsal

445
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,931
scales, symmetric sub-caudal scalation,
darker ventral bands, obviously...

446
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:10,803
okay, here we go.

447
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:11,570
CYRIL: Wh-?

448
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,039
What is wrong with you people?!

449
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:17,543
GILLETTE: What's wrong with you?
Gimme that!

450
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:18,978
GILLETTE: Here! Tada. A Snake!

451
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:21,047
CYRIL: Oh that's crap...
TURKMENI [alarmed gasp]

452
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,616
TURKMEN CHIEF: Gurpgork?!
Dishlemek gurpgork?!

453
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:27,620
CYRIL: I -- wanna say duh, but...
ARCHER: What's the point?

454
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:31,357
ARCHER: C'mon, this is stupid, I don't
need to see this, I remember all of it.

455
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,359
JAMES MASON: Do you?

456
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:38,031
CHILD ARCHER: Yeah...
ARCHER: Yeah I mean, that's me, I'm like... Six.

457
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:40,466
I'm six today, it's my birthday.

458
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,414
JAMES MASON: And your
Mother isn't home, is she?

459
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:45,905
ARCHER: No, she had to -- look,
Guatemala's democratically

460
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,574
elected government wasn't
gonna overthrow itself.

461
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:49,342
JAMES MASON: Mmm.

462
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,443

say, indisposed...

464
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,048
WOODHOUSE: [heroin-induced snoring]

465
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:57,550
JAMES MASON: There was no one
to give you a birthday present.

466
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:02,121
ARCHER: I... wait, no, yeah, I got...
TURKMEN CHIEF: Derman!

467
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:03,923
Derman gurpgork!

468
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:06,559
Derman gurpgork etmek!

469
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,527
GILLETTE: No, I don't think
he can keep bread down...

470
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:11,564
CYRIL: No, I think it's--
Derman is medicine!

471
00:19:11,631 --> 00:19:13,132
TURKMEN CHIEF: Derman gurpgork!

472
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,867
CYRIL: I think it's antivenom! Gimme!

473
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:15,895
TURKMEN CHIEF: Yok, yok!

474
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:17,837
Kop kop kop baksheesh.

475
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,772
CYRIL: Oh.

476
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,108
He wants a lot lot lot of money.

477
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:22,942
GILLETTE: So?

478
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,777
We've got ninety-five grand!

479
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,745
CYRIL: But that's for the mission, to --
GILLETTE: Blow up a

480
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,314
frickin oil pipeline?

481
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,582
CYRIL: Wait, really?

482
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,019
GILLETTE: Cyril, what did you think
she meant by "hinder construction?"

483
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,754
CYRIL: Oh.

484
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,691
Do you ever think maybe we're
kinda not always a hundred

485
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:41,094
percent of the time
doing the right thing?

486
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,201
GILLETTE: Do you ever shut
up and give that man-bear

487
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:48,134
twenty-five grand so you and I
can split the other seventy?

488
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:50,636
CYRIL: Yes, yes I do.

489
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:54,874
ARCHER: I got a... yeah,
I got an alligator!

490
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:55,941
CHILD ARCHER: [tiny gasp]

491
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,076
MYSTERY MAN: Hello, Sterling.

492
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,479
MYSTERY MAN: Your mother doesn't
know I'm here, but I wanted to

493
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,414
bring you a birthday present.

494
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,082
I hope you like alligators.

495
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,371
CHILD ARCHER: I do...
ARCHER: I did...

496
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:06,926
CHILD ARCHER: Thank you, sir.

497
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:08,821
But... who are you?

498
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:12,225
MYSTERY MAN: Sterling, I...
am your real father.

499
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,026
CHILD ARCHER: [small gasp]

500
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,693
ARCHER: [huge gasp]

501
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,196
CYRIL: Archer?

502
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:18,331
ARCHER: Buck Henry?

503
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:20,886
Oh my God, Cyril! Ray! I know --
CYRIL: You're okay!

504
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:22,822
Hey, we gave you the antivenom.

505
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,264
Cyril, shut your dickhole.

506
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,242
Jesus, God.

507
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,267
I know who my real father was.

508
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:28,795
Well? Who was he?

509
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,177
He...was...ugh...

510
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,350
Now it's gone.

511
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:37,744
God dammit.

512
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:48,830
