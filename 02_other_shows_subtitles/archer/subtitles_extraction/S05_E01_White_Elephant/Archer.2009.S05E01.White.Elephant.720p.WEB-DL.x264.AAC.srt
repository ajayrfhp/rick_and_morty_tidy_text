00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:21,732
(muffled)

13
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,867
>> ARCHER: Mawp. Mawp.

14
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,235
Mawp!

15
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,270
(groans)

16
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,237
Was that a flashbang?

17
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,038
>> MALORY: Sterling?

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,639
>> ARCHER: Mawp?

19
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,607
Ow!

20
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:30,374
>> MALORY: Do something.

21
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,041
>> ARCHER: What?

22
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,142
I brought roses.

23
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:33,377
Jesus, Mother, it's just your

24
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,878
birthday, not the...

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,647
>> MALORY: About that!

26
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:38,115
>> ARCHER: Oh. Duh.

27
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,450
>> LANA: Archer!

28
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,752
>> ARCHER: (gasps) Lana!

29
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,721
>> LANA (mocking): "Lana!" Ugh.

30
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,155
(slurping)

31
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:46,557
Not her birthday.

32
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,159
>> ARCHER: Ah! (grunts)

33
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,294
>> CHERYL/CAROL: No, move!

34
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,228
Get away from us!

35
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,296
>> PAM: Yeah, they're shooting

36
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,097
at you!

37
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:53,897
>> ARCHER: Who?

38
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:54,632
>> CHERYL/CAROL: The

39
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:55,432
storm-ninjas!

40
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:56,066
>> ARCHER: What?

41
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:57,501
That's not a thing, idiot!

42
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,071
Oh. I stand corrected.

43
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,306
>> LANA: Son of a...!

44
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,942
Bitches, I am pregnant!

45
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:06,176
>> CYRIL: Yes! (laughs)

46
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:07,511
Who could forget?

47
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,646
With the bastard spawn

48
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,613
of a total stranger.

49
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,181
>> LANA: Okay, first of all...

50
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,016
Cover your eyes and ears!

51
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:12,950
>> CYRIL: You're not the boss

52
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:13,984
of me!

53
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,152
(explosion)

54
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,754
(high-pitched ringing)

55
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,522
>> CYRIL: Meep? Meep?

56
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:20,124
(laughs)

57
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,259
>> LANA: What's that, Beaker?

58
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,694
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God, is Beaker

59
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:24,361
not the best?

60
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:25,696
Meep, meep, meep!

61
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,097
And wait, what's his, uh...

62
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,032
the name of... Brett!

63
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:28,932
>> BRETT: No, no, no, leave

64
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:29,767
me alone!

65
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,367
>> ARCHER: Shut up.

66
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,301
Who's Beaker's boss?

67
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:32,202
>> BRETT: What?

68
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,370
>> ARCHER: Beaker's boss.

69
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,638
>> BRETT: Goddamn it, I can't

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,639
hear...

71
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,307
>> ARCHER: Brett?

72
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,642
Well, he died doing what

73
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:40,644
he loved.

74
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:41,645
Getting shot.

75
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:42,379
>> CYRIL: Meep. Meep.

76
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,981
>> LANA: Archer! Who the hell...

77
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,182
>> ARCHER: Shut up, it's on the

78
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:45,816
tip of my tongue!

79
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:46,483
>> LANA: What is?!

80
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:47,651
>> ARCHER: Beaker's boss!

81
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:48,719
>> LANA: What?

82
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:49,987
>> GILLETTE: She meant who the

83
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,155
hell are these guys,

84
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:53,023
you big dumb idiot asshole!

85
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,158
>> ARCHER: Said the guy in

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,459
>> GILLETTE: What the...?

87
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:56,393
>> ARCHER: I just frickin' got

88
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,194
here, Ray!

89
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,562
How the hell should I...

90
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,666
No...

91
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:04,001
>> LANA: No, no, no, no,

92
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:05,302
no, no...

93
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,303
>> CYRIL: What, what're you...?

94
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:06,870
Oh.

95
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,571
>> GILLETTE: Oh, boy.

96
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:08,172
>> AGENT: FBI!

97
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,873
Nobody move! FBI!

98
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,241
(Malory sighs wearily)

99
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,209
>> MALORY: Second worst birthday

100
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,043
ever.

101
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:13,711
>> ARCHER: What?

102
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:14,745
How is this better than

103
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,013
your second fake 50th?

104
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,314
>> HOLLY: Oh, come on, guys,

105
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:19,383
we talked about this!

106
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,517
You're supposed to yell

107
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,152
"FBI" at the beginning.

108
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,721
After the flashbangs,

109
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:24,688
but before Other Fat Mike

110
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,222
gets shot.

111
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,557
>> AGENT: Ow.

112
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,357
>> HOLLY: And what happened

113
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,058
with getting "FBI"

114
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,026
on the fronts of

115
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:29,727
the uniforms, huh?

116
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:30,427
>> AGENT: Ow!

117
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,862
>> ARCHER: Uh, what happened

118
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,696
with since when the hell

119
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,098
does the frickin' FBI get off...

120
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,898
>> HOLLY: Sterling Archer?

121
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,599
>> ARCHER: Yes! What?!

122
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,934
>> HOLLY: I'm Special Agent in

123
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:38,235
Charge Holly, and you are

124
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,369
extremely under arrest.

125
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,105
>> ARCHER: (laughs) For what?

126
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,740
>> HOLLY: Uh, in addition to

127
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,674
the attempted murder

128
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:44,742
of a federal agent?

129
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:45,876
>> ARCHER: Yes.

130
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,277
>> HOLLY: Well, there's gonna be

131
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,846
just a whole bunch of charges,

132
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,013
but mostly treason.

133
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:50,681
>> ARCHER: Treason?

134
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:51,248
>> LANA: What?

135
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,116
Archer, what'd you do?

136
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,417
>> HOLLY: No, no, not just him.

137
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,518
You, too, Miss Kane.

138
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,286
>> HOLLY: Yeah. Everybody.

139
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,588
Especially you, Ms. Archer.

140
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,722
>> LANA: Is this about the fake

141
00:04:58,724 --> 00:04:59,256
hydrogen bomb?

142
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,858
>> HOLLY: No, but let's put

143
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,859
a pin in that.

144
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,260
This is about conducting

145
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,429
espionage operations, for years,

146
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,463
with no authority or

147
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,598
permission whatsoever,

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,532
from the United States

149
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:09,032
government.

150
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:09,633
(Lana gasps)

151
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:10,467
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?

152
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:11,568
Mother!

153
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,036
>> LANA: Like, 50 times I asked

154
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,938
>> MALORY: And like 50 times

155
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,773
I lied.

156
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,074
Sue me.

157
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:18,442
I want my phone call.

158
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,210
>> AGENT (over radio): Uh, sir?

159
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:21,545
It's like you said, he's

160
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:22,546
dug in there like a tick, and...

161
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:23,480
>> KRIEGER (over radio): Never!

162
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,815
You'll never take me alive!

163
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,049
(Holly sighs wearily)

164
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,251
>> HOLLY: Okay, breach it.

165
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:27,951
>> AGENT: Roger that.

166
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,820
(explosion)

167
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,221
>> KRIEGER: On second thought,

168
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,322
I very much prefer

169
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:32,990
to be taken alive.

170
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:34,491
Just let me clear the ol'

171
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:35,659
browser history and...

172
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:36,960
No, no, no, no, no... oof!

173
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,228
Oh, come on!

174
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,765
>> HOLOGRAM: Ooh, G-man-san.

175
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,100
>> ARCHER: I'm serious, you are

176
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,401
not putting those on me.

177
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:45,435
>> HOLLY: Mr. Archer, please

178
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:46,403
turn around and place your hands

179
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:47,070
behind your back.

180
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:48,405
>> ARCHER: (laughs) Or what?

181
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,740
What are you gonna do, taser...

182
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,842
(Archer gibbering)

183
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:53,944
(Archer sputters)

184
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,112
(Cheryl/Carol gasps)

185
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:56,079
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Do me! Do me!

186
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,014
Do me, do me, do me!

187
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:57,981
>> HOLLY: I'm not tasering you,

188
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,649
so just...

189
00:05:58,651 --> 00:05:59,449
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Do me!

190
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,417
(Holly grunts)

191
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,318
(taser clicking,

192
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,153
Cheryl/Carol groaning)

193
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,454
(Cheryl/Carol sighs)

194
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,523
Thank you.

195
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,791
>> MALORY: Ugh.

196
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,693
Our tax dollars hard at work.

197
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,761
(laughing): Well, not mine,

198
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,496
obviously, but...

199
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,031
>> HOLLY: What's that?

200
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,599
>> MALORY: Damn it.

201
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,038
>> ARCHER: Whatever, Cyril.

202
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,639
I don't care who you are,

203
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,374
when you get zapped with 50,000

204
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,109
volts, it's like, like...

205
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,845
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Sploosh.

206
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,313
And then it's like wave after

207
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,647
wave crashing over you, into

208
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,383
you, and...

209
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,651
>> ARCHER: Will you shut up?

210
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,719
>> PAM: You shut up.

211
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,720
Let her talk.

212
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:37,554
>> ARCHER: You shut up!

213
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:38,689
>> PAM: Make me!

214
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,123
(shouting, grunting)

215
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,991
(Malory whistles loudly)

216
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:41,859
>> ALL: Ow! Ow!

217
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,559
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus!

218
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,794
>> MALORY: All of you.

219
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:44,995
Shut your various holes

220
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,630
and listen to me very carefully.

221
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,065
>> CYRIL: Why, so you can tell

222
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:48,799
us more lies?

223
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,399
>> KRIEGER: Yeah.

224
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,634
(all muttering)

225
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:51,635
>> MALORY: So I can save you

226
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:52,402
from life in prison!

227
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:54,371
Sorry, Ramona, I know to you

228
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,706
it's just one big sexy briar

229
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,306
patch, but...

230
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:57,074
>> GILLETTE: You know...

231
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,041
>> MALORY: Zip it!

232
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,743
That goes for all of you!

233
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,078
And when we get in there,

234
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,012
you keep it zipped.

235
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,580
Because there's a chance I can

236
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:04,815
make this all go away,

237
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,183
but only if you people don't try

238
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,251
to save your own necks

239
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,685
by ratting out everyone else!

240
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:09,920
(all muttering)

241
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,355
>> MALORY: Damn it, trust me!

242
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,056
And say nothing!

243
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,926
You heard me, J. Edna.

244
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,594
>> LANA: Not one word.

245
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:18,595
>> ARCHER: Well, except for

246
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:19,930
those three.

247
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:21,698
And then those five. And...

248
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,432
>> LANA: Archer!

249
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:23,400
>> ARCHER: Then that one.

250
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,501
>> CYRIL: I really shouldn't

251
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:26,370
I mean, unless you can

252
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,404
guarantee me...

253
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,505
>> GILLETTE: Total immunity.

254
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:29,439
>> CHERYL/CAROL: And I mean from

255
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:30,207
everything.

256
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,074
>> GILLETTE: Including anything

257
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,076
you find on my computer.

258
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,511
Or in my crawlspace.

259
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:36,046
>> PAM: Oh, and throw a bone

260
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:36,880
into me.

261
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:37,915
>> AGENT 2: Excuse me?

262
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,216
>> GILLETTE: I said Ms. Archer

263
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,018
had an affair with the head of

264
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,020
the KGB for, like, 30 years.

265
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,121
>> CHERYL/CAROL (laughs): Yeah,

266
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,224
until he got blown up.

267
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:48,725
Which was actually my fault.

268
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,060
>> CYRIL: Because she was busy

269
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,061
having choke-sex with a

270
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,262
murderous cyborg, who then

271
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,365
became the new head of the KGB.

272
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,633
>> KRIEGER: Until I built a

273
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:57,634
sexier one out of illegal

274
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,468
Soviet parts.

275
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,070
And a corpse.

276
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,638
>> PAM: There was no shortage of

277
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,873
dead bodies around ISIS.

278
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:03,874
>> GILLETTE: One of which

279
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:04,942
belonged to the prime minister

280
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,476
>> CYRIL: Oh, Jesus, I forgot

281
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,544
about the...

282
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:08,612
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Giant pot farm

283
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,579
in West Virginia.

284
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,881
>> PAM: And this whole other

285
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,215
thing with the Yakuza.

286
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:13,083
>> GILLETTE: Irish Mob.

287
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:13,917
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Piracy.

288
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,751
>> CYRIL: White slavery.

289
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,486
>> PAM: No, actual piracy.

290
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:17,754
With, like, boats.

291
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:18,889
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I want to

292
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,557
say... Burt Reynolds?

293
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,491
>> CYRIL: Poaching alligators...

294
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:22,259
>> GILLETTE: Smuggling

295
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:23,760
>> KRIEGER: Defiling a corpse...

296

>> CYRIL: Defiling a different

297
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,163
>> PAM: Kidnapping the Pope...

298
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,231
>> CHERY/CAROL: (laughing)

299
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,167
Faking my own kidnapping!

300
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,168
Arson.

301
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,269
>> PAM: Bumfights!

302
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,337
You know, like when you pay

303
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:34,171
bums to...

304
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,238
>> CYRIL: Destroy an oil

305
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,106
pipeline in...

306
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,107
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I want to say

307
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:37,741
Burt Reynolds.

308
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:38,976
>> CYRIL: ...Turkmenistan?

309
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:39,676
>> KRIEGER: Odessa.

310
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:40,844
You know, the ratlines?

311
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:41,979
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Where you make

312
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,246
it look like a murder-suicide,

313
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,582
>> KRIEGER: Is it murder if they

314
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,651
were my own clones?

315
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,086
I'm seriously asking.

316
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,087
>> GILLETTE: Oh, because,

317
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,755
speaking of sexual assault...

318
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,091
>> PAM (munching): Which time?

319
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,359
'Cause for one of 'em

320
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:56,360
I got a pretty good excuse.

321
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,594
>> AGENT 2: Can I stop you?

322
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:58,528
Please?

323
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,830
>> PAM: That's what he said.

324
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,031
(Pam clears throat)

325
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,332
Inappropriate.

326
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,767
>> CYRIL: Geez, when you just

327
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,268
list everything ISIS has done,

328
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,304
it sounds kind of bad.

329
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:08,138
>> AGENT 3: And so if I were

330
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,805
you...

331
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:09,673
>> ARCHER: You'd get laid

332
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,342
>> AGENT 3: I'd start talking.

333
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,643
Everybody else is!

334
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,012
They're in there right now,

335
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,046
saying he's the brains

336
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:16,947
behind ISIS.

337
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:18,782

00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:19,783
Hey, screw you!

Mr. My Mother's A Lying Bitch

And I'm Too Stupid To Realize

My Life's A Pathetic Joke!

343
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:26,490
>> ARCHER: Oh, nice to meet you,

344
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,325
Mrs. Hello My Kid's From A Sperm

345
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,326
Bank Since I Can't Keep A Man

346
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,560
Because In Addition To My

347
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:31,795
Jillion Neuroses

348
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,397
I Have A Weird-looking Vagina!

349
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,564
(Lana gasps)

350
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,500
(Archer and Lana grunting)

351
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:37,467
>> AGENT 3: Okay, knock it off.

352
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,235
Hey!

353
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,203
(FBI Agents grunting)

354
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,471
>> ARCHER: I can't believe they

355
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,173
fell for that.

356
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,075
>> LANA: Ahem. Miss what?

357
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,009
>> ARCHER: Sorry, it-it's not

358
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:46,710
that weird look...

359
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,511
Lana!

360
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:48,879
(gunshot)

361
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:49,980
>> ARCHER: Thought you were

362
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,248
gonna shoot me.

363
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,849
>> LANA: Day's not over.

364
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:53,917
>> ARCHER: And seriously, Lana,

365
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,653
sorry for what I said.

366
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,088
Then that's where you say...

367
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,089
(Archer yells)

368
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,157
>> LANA: Good-bye, Archer.

369
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,158
>> ARCHER: Where do you think

370
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,159
you're going?

371
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,593
>> LANA: Not to jail with you

372
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:04,394
and your mother.

373
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,328
>> ARCHER: Well, you know,

374
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,530
we can ask the judge...

375
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,330
>> LANA: You know prisons

376
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,331
aren't co-ed, right?

377
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,433
>> ARCHER: Oh. Okay, we got

378
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:10,667
to get out of here.

379
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,735
>> LANA: "We"? There is no

380
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,603
"we" anymore, Archer!

381
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,005
Well, there's this we...

382
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:15,839
>> ARCHER: Uh...

383
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,873
>> LANA: Oh, shit.

384
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,075
>> ARCHER: Yeah.

385
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,509
You're gonna be a great mother.

386
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,544
>> LANA: I could start smoking

387
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,445
crack today, and he'd still

388
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:22,446
turn out better than you.

389
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,780
>> ARCHER: And why is that?

390
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:24,848
Because I never had

391
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,582
a father, Lana?

392
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,184
So why don't you shut up,

393
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:28,351
and then also marry me.

394
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,853
>> LANA: What?!

395
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:30,720
>> ARCHER: I'm serious--

396
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:31,588
we can go underground,

397
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,090
get new identities,

398
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,224
and spend the rest

399
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,358
of our lives together, Lana.

400
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,359
We'll be a family.

401
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,728
You, me, the baby and your

402
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,931
not-that-weird-looking vagina.

403
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,032
>> LANA: Okay, don't take

404
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,601
this the wrong way...

405
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,635
but I would rather

406
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,037
lose the baby.

407
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,605
>> ARCHER: Wha... I...

408
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,639
>> LANA: Okay, that-that

409
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:50,941
wasn't...

410
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,142
I didn't...

411
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,443
>> ARCHER: Excuse me.

412
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,980
(Lana sighs)

413
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,752
(Archer laughing)

414
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:03,820
>> ARCHER: Jesus Christ,

415
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:04,588
come on, you idiot.

416
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,423
(Lana grunts)

417
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:07,891
>> CYRIL: "I have read this

418
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:08,758
statement, each page of which

419

bears my initials, and I do

00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,461

426

Carol Tunt."

429
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,241
Now, I would like

430
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,009
a ride home, please.

431
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,077
Preferably in an Apache

432
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:27,978
helicopter.

433
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,945
>> PAM: And I believe there

434
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,013
was some mention

435
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:31,648
of throwing a bone into me?

436
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,649
>> FBI AGENT 2: What are you

437
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,683
talking about?

438
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:36,119
>> PAM: A penis in my vagina.

439
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:36,987
Or wherever, but

440
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,321
come on, chop-chop,

441
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,322
I got to go start

442
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:39,990
enjoying my immunity.

443
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:40,790
(FBI Agent 2 laughs)

444
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,025
>> FBI AGENT 2: Yeah, you said

445
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:42,792
immunity. I didn't.

446
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:43,660
>> RAY: Dukes!

447
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,461
>> CYRIL: God!

448
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:45,495
>> KRIEGER: Damn it!

449
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,496
>> CHERYL/CAROL: So is that a

450
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,531
"no" on the Apache, or...?

451
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,099
(knocking)

452
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,600
>> FBI AGENT 4: Oh, my God,

453
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:51,601
okay, so this ditz...

454
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:52,669
Oh.

455
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,137
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Now who's the

456
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:54,871
ditz, huh?

457
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,606
>> LANA: Would you just come on?

458
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:57,641
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I'm seriously

459
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:58,475
asking.

460
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,010
>> PAM: Aw, but look at him.

461
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,144
All tied up like

462
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:02,279
a sexy little Christmas ham.

463
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,380
>> CYRIL: And can I just go

464
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:04,347
on record as saying

465
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,349
I think this is an extremely

466
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,517
bad idea?

467
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,952
>> LANA: You know what's a bad

468
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:09,686
idea? Prison.

469
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,721
>> ARCHER: Because, spoiler

470
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,822
alert, they're unisex.

471
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,258
>> PAM: Hello, best part.

472
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,695
>> HOLLY: Yeah?

473
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,530
>> ARCHER: Uh, uh...

474
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,398
>> CHERYL/CAROL (old lady

475
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,332
voice): Oh, Clyde?

476
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,900
Clyde, is that you?

477
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,468
It's me, dear,

478
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,804
Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover's mother.

479
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,675
>> HOLLY: Um... it's open.

480
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,709
Ma'am.

481
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,144
>> ARCHER: Nobody move!

482
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:35,078
Or...

483
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,079
>> MALORY: What the hell are

484
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,080
you doing?

485
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:37,981
>> ARCHER: Getting us out

486
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,982
of here.

487
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,016
>> MALORY: I've already done

488
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:40,984
that. Let him go.

489
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,085
And you'll just have

490
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:43,320
to put that on my...

491
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:44,521
whatever... crime tab.

492
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:46,156
>> HOLLY: No, no, no, no, no.

493
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,524
Taking a federal agent hostage

494
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,925
is a separate charge.

495
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:49,993
>> MALORY: Oh, well, then

496
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:50,760
perhaps we should get

497
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:52,562
him back on the phone.

498
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,364
>> HOLLY: I... that... I-I

499
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,498
don't... There's no need

500
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,234
to bother the... Eh, look.

501
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,501
If you'll just sign this form...

502
00:12:58,503 --> 00:12:59,869
>> MALORY: Doo, doo, doo.

503
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:00,904
"In lieu of criminal

cease and desist

(all gasping)

513
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,350
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God.

514
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:14,384
>> HOLLY: Or face a mandatory

515
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,619
sentence of life in federal

516
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,620
prison without parole.

517
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,754
>> ARCHER: You got to be

518
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,688
kidding me.

519
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,689
>> MALORY: "Signed, Malory

520
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,857
Archer."

521
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:21,891
>> LANA: Oh, my God.

522
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,693
>> ARCHER: No, uh-uh, nope.

523
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,962
Because correct me if I'm wrong,

524
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:27,030
but that entire document

525
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,898
is completely unenforceable.

526
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,600
I correct you. You are wrong.

527
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,635
>> MALORY: For God's sake,

528
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,702
Sterling, it's the government.

529
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:33,937
Even if it weren't legal,

530
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:34,971
they'd enforce it.

531
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,306
>> HOLLY: Hey, save it for four

532
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:37,540
ninths of the Supreme Court.

533
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:38,475
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up.

534
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:39,309
And unless there's

535
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,243
anything else?

536
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,444
>> HOLLY: Uh, just this,

537
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,646
releasing the bureau from any

538
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,980
claims relating to the death

539
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:45,215
of your employee...

540
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:46,916
Brett, uh, Bunson?

541
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:47,751
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God!

542
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:48,752
>> LANA: What?

543
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,387
>> ARCHER: Beaker's boss!

544
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,622
Bunsen frickin' Honeydew!

545
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,923
Woooooo!!

546
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,558
(groans)

547
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,127
That was figuratively

548
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,561
killing me.

549
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,301
>> ARCHER: I can't believe

550
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,069
they're taking our building.

551
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,137
>> LANA: Screw the building!

552
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,338
What about our jobs?

553
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,173
Oh, and our health insurance.

554
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,241
Which I'm pretty sure

555
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:12,242
I'm gonna need.

556
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,410
>> KRIEGER: I'll be your doctor.

557
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,444
>> LANA: Well, if I want

558
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:15,612
Hitler's DNA spliced into him,

559
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:16,746
I'll give you a call.

560
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,081
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, I'm around.

561
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,582
>> MALORY: Well, as for me, I

562
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:20,917
think I'll start shopping my

563
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,818
memoirs.

564
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,852
How does the title

565
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,154
Secrets and Silk grab you?

566
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,188
>> ARCHER: Tightly by my

567
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,156
childhood's throat.

568
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,791
>> MALORY: Oh, you're just

569
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:28,525
jealous.

570
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:29,426
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, jealous

571
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,460
of my fallback career.

572
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:31,528
>> PAM (laughing): As what?

573
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,862
An actual acorn?

574
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:33,997
>> CHERYL/CAROL: As America's

575
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,765
number one country singer.

576
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,801
>> LANA: And kudos.

577
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:39,669
But for the rest of us trapped

578
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,171
in the realm of possibility...

579
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,205
>> CHERYL/CAROL: I'm gonna be

580
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,306
bigger than Mac Davis.

581
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,307
And Mac Davis can

582
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,775
totally suck it.

583
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,277
>> ARCHER: And you can all suck

584
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,545
it because I am gonna play

585
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,013
professional lacrosse.

586
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,614
>> LANA: Okay, even if that were

587
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:52,515
a real thing...

588
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,550
>> ARCHER: Is it not?

589
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,051
>> LANA: ...you are way too old.

590
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,152
>> ARCHER: I am not...

591
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,654
Oh, my God. I am way too old.

592
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:58,388
(cracks knuckles)

593
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,556
>> PAM: Welp, hope I'm not too

594
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:00,623
old to get back into

595
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,524
underground fighting.

596
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,459
>> CYRIL: Darn.

597
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:03,893
All those jobs are awesome.

598
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:04,861
>> LANA: And by awesome you

599
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:05,662
mean delusional.

600
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:06,629
>> CYRIL: Because it's gonna

601
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:08,031
be hard to go back to an

602
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,132
accounting firm after this job.

603
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,166
>> ARCHER: Especially after

604
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,067
Mother gives you a shitty

605
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,068
reference.

606
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,069
Mother, do that.

607
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,137
>> CYRIL: I meant it'll be

608
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,004
boring.

609
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:15,839
Although, I guess

610
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,006
I could always go back

611
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,908
to being a defense attorney.

612
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,642
(all groaning)

613
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:20,910
>> LANA: When were you ever a

614
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:21,845
lawyer?

615
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,146
>> CYRIL: Lana, we had long

616
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:24,180
talks about this.

617
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:25,749
How I went to night school

618
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,916
to pass the CPA exam

619
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,318
because I was so burned out

620
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,352
defending scumbags

621
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,154
as a public defender?

622
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,257
Numerous... long talks.

623
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,225
>> LANA: With me?

624
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,259
>> CYRIL: Oh, for...

625
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,260
(Archer laughs)

626
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:38,261
Well, don't come crying to me

627
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:39,262
when that fatherless kid of

628
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,497
yours buys a gun and steals a

629
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,998
car, and he tries to run

630
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,233
but he don't get far!

631
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,667
>> CHERYL/CAROL: ¶ In the ghetto

632
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,403
where Mac Davis sucks it. ¶

633
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:47,937
>> ARCHER: Are you done?

634
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:49,539
>> CHERYL/CAROL: Are you done?!

635
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,341
Again, seriously asking.

636
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,009
>> ARCHER: Yes. So I guess we

637
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,677
should talk about the elephant

638
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,279
in the room. Namely...

639
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,614
What are we gonna do

640
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,615
with literally,

641
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:00,116
not figuratively,

642
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:03,086
a ton of cocaine?

643
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,088
>> MALORY: Well...

644
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,590
>> LANA: Wha...? Oh, come on!

645
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,525
>> ARCHER: What, Lana,

646
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,292
we must be talking...

647
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:11,561
>> CYRIL: Wholesale? Uh, 50, 60

648
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:12,595
million?

649
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,530
>> LANA (laughs): Wholesale.

650
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,298
So, what, we form a cartel?

651
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,566
>> MALORY: Well, how hard could

652
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:17,767
it be? I mean...

653
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,535
>> LANA: Don't.

654
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:19,736
>> MALORY: ...if Mexicans can

655
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,204
do it.

656
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,173
(ice clinks in glass)

657
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,442
>> ARCHER: $50 million, Lana.

658
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,976
We sell this and we're out.

659
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,311
I promise.

660
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:29,312
>> MALORY: Dr. Krieger has

661
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,713
devised a way to transport

662
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,248
the cocaine undetected.

663
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,316
>> ARCHER: You're probably gonna

664
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,317
want to try to minimize

665
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,418
the sweating.

666
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,953
We're gonna go ahead and take

667
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,154
the cocaine and the money.

668
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:39,122
>> MALORY: What do you mean

669
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,156
counterfeit?

670
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,090
>> ARCHER: The Yakuza?

671
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,158
>> MALORY: Amphetamines?!

672
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,493
>> ARCHER: Well, Pam screwed

673
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:44,828
the Yakuza out of a million

674
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,396
bucks of amphetamines, so now

675
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:47,397
they're gonna cut her head off.

676
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,331
>> CHERYL/CAROL: ¶ Baby, please

677
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,265
don't go ¶

678
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,066
>> ARCHER: Get down!

679
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,000
>> CHERYL/CAROL: ¶ Baby, please

680
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:51,768
don't go ¶

681
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,635
