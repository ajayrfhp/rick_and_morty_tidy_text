Alaska P. Davidson...

158
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,806
- But J. Edna fired her.
- "J. Edna"?

159
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,102
Hoover. And trust me,

160
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,556
- history will not be kind to that man.
- How come?

161
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,907
Well, besides his being
a misogynistic,

162
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,227
anti-semitic,
anti-catholic racist...

163
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,288
Anti-catholic?

164
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,806
How do you
feel about cross-dressing?

165
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,470
Eh, I try not to judge people.

166
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,149
Well, then, you're
in the minority.

167
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,039
Yeah, speaking of, uh...

168
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:42,540
(sighs) FBI? Literally,
maybe five Negro Agents.

169
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,868
Actually, probably less...

170
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,181
- Fewer.
- Shut up. Since Marcus Garvey died.

171
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:48,813
So, no, I work in
the Intelligence Unit

172
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,352
- of the Internal Revenue Service.
- (Laughing)

173
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:56,359
- What? The IRS has cops?
- Yes!

174
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,735
(Laughing) Doing what?

175
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,378
- Uh, ever heard of al Capone?
- Seriously?

176
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,145
Well, he died in prison,
thanks to the IRS.

177
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:07,696
He died in prison thanks to
Tertiary Neurosyphilis.

178
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,157
Well, okay, fine.
Um, uh... (Mutters)

179
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,618
Oh, oh, the Lindbergh kidnapping.
The IRS solved that.

180
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:17,556
Oh, yeah, I bet they were so happy
to get their dead baby back.

181
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:20,061
- Don't be a twat.
- Fair enough.

182
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,556
(Archer:)
<i>I thought it was unfair</i>

183
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,059
<i>for mother to blame me
for the drop going tits-up.</i>

184
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,782
<i>After all, she was
supposed to be</i>

185
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:28,660
<i>helping me
find woodhouse's killer.</i>

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,485
<i>But so far, she's done nothing.
Right?</i>

187
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:35,239
Hey, I said, "right?"
Oh, Jesus,

188
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,923
I thought I was talking
to a tramp or a dog, or...

189
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,642
Man, this Dexedrine
really does have an edge.

190
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,587
Better take one of
these Codeines.

191
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,649
Although I'm not sure
which is which,

192
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,720
or what I've
actually been taking.

193
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,987
So...

194
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,743
Better take one of each.

195
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:53,173
(Crunching)
Mm. Well, or two, maybe.

196
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,595
(Crunching)
Or three.

197
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,182
Three, and that's it. Done.
(Crunching)

198
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,610
(Laughs)
Okay, five.

199
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,321
So, what's wrong
with this thing?

200
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:05,982
There's a bullet hole
in the radiator.

201
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,313
Yeah, there is.

202
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,313
- Eh, you got a raw potato?
- Uh, no.

203
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,173
- A raw egg?
- No.

204
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:13,759
Black pepper?
No, Trinette's Concussion!

205
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:16,032
(Gasps)
You think I got a concussion?

206
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,360
Maybe, with your crazy
jibber-jabber

207
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,157
about Spanish omelet
ingredients!

208
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,501
Huh? Oh. No, dummy.

209
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,579
Those are just Jerry-rigged ways
to fix a leaky radiator.

210
00:09:25,673 --> 00:09:26,829
Whaaat?

211
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,235
Throw a chunk of potato
or some pepper in there, cap it.

212
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,134
The steam pressure shoves it
in the hole and seals it up.

213
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,610
Same with an egg. Ya crack it in,
it cooks on the way to the hole.

214
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,491
Bull... Shit.

215
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,243
Aw, come on.
That's common knowledge.

216
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,024
It is absolutely not.

217
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:45,485
Why do you think it's called
the "potato compartment"?

218
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,477
Why do I think
the glove compartment

219
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,415
is called
the "potato compartment"?

220
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:52,243
"Glove compartment"?
Is this some Irish bullshit?

221
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,187
- Oh, now who's a racist?
- Oh, for the...

222
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,142
Even if I shoved an entire
uncooked breakfast in there...

223
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,768
- Which you wouldn't wanna do...
- All the water

224
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,032
already leaked out.

225
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,806
Well, yeah,
so you just piss in it.

226
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,235
- I think we should split up.
- What?

227
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,649
Yeah, you don't need me.

228
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,782
I'm just slowing you down.
So, uh...

229
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:10,903
Aw, come on.
Don't say that.

230
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:13,392
No, yeah, you should go.
Away.

231
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,267
- Ya sure?
- So very.

232
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,196
Well, okay, then.
I... (Sighs)

233
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,142
Guess I'll just ride
with this mook.

234
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:21,884
(Car approaching)
What the...

235
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:23,368
Good evening, ladies.

236
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,030
(Sighs) Why are you here, Mr.
Vandertunt?

237
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,712
In the hope the kidnappers
left my bag behind.

238
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:29,881
It was a gift.

239
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,438
Well, you're out of luck.

240
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:32,860
And those cops you brought

241
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,501
- stole the money.
- What? Those finks!

242
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,923
Yeah, that prick Archer said

243
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,142
one of 'em owed a bunch
of money to len Trexler.

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,001
Well, then, that's
where we're going.

245
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:42,618
We're commandeering
this vehicle.

246
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,618
Can obvious prostitutes do that?

247
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,790
I'm not an obvious prostitute!
She's a T-man, ya dummy.

248
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,845
Wow! I would not
have guessed that.

249
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,474
Not a Transvestite,
a Treasury Agent!

250
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,282
And quit blabbing that around.
Bel-air road.

251
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,212
Go!
Yes, sir!

252
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,001
"Ma'am"! Sorry! However
you self-identify!

253
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,821
Ugh!
Will you calm down?

254
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,470
I just wanna get some hot water!

255
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:12,509
Well, you'll be<i> in</i> hot water
if you try to sneak off

256
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,829
before Archer comes back
with that ransom money.

257
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,956
I heard you! Tsk!

258
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,001
You make being
kidnapped just awful.

259
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,751
There's a reason they
say "kidnapping victim"

260
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,845
and not "kidnapping winner."
(Trapdoor opens)

261
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,243
- Krieger: What's that? - (Gasps)

262
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,462
(Zerk growls)
(Screams)

263
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:29,172
Don't you have a house to haunt?

264
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,360
No.

265
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,368
And what is that?
What do you have?

266
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,868
Um...

267
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,517
Nothing.
(Trapdoor closes)

268
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,407
I think it was something.

269
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,210
Boy, you don't miss a trick.

270
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:51,117
We'll see how funny you are
hopping around on one foot.

271
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,587
(Chuckling)

272
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,515
That actually does sound funny.
(Chuckles)

273
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:59,720
(Lana:) And wait. Weren't you
wearing a Polo uniform?

274
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,448
- Did you go home and change?
- I did, yes.

275
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,329
In all the excitement of the
ransom drop, I evacuated.

276
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:07,063
Yeah, well, I would've
hightailed it too.

277
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,306
No, no, no, no.
Common misconception.

278
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:10,886
When a person evacuates,

279
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,321
it means they empty
their bladder and bowels.

280
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,313
- (Both): Ew! Well, I'm sorry.
- I didn't invent Latin.

281
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,056
- Oh. Ooh. So what do you call this?
- No.

282
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,149
- What, the potato compart...
- No.

283
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,360
- Spud box?
- No!

284
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,345
- Tater hutch.
- Rrrrrgh!

285
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,056
I knew we'd
get there eventually.

286
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,785
Can we eventually
get to Trexler's?

287
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,587
I mean, presumably.

288
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,877
Ugh! I swear to God...

289
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,790
(Figgis:)
Poovey, if you don't shut up...

290
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,181
(Poovey:) No, you shut up!
Come on! Wait!

291
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:39,962
It's not too late to turn back.

292
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:41,392
Yes. It is.

293
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,456
And why the hell are you
so desperate for money?

294
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,063
Because you know how
much it's gonna cost

295
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,056
to send a kid to Stanford in
1967?

296
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:48,211
I know if you don't shut up,

297
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,251
you won't have to
worry about it,

298
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,703
because I'm gonna shoot you
in the... genitals!

299
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,134
Huh. Now, why would
the door be open?

300
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,735
Maybe he's got a selfish partner

301
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:58,517
who left the door
open on purpose

302
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,876
so his new puppy
could get run over by a car.

303
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:03,563
Oh, and the puppy's name
is dreams!

304
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,884
(Cocks gun)
Oh, go ahead.

305
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:07,563
Blow it off!
(Shushing)

306
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,681
(Quietly): Something's
not right, you idiot.

307
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,809
(Whispers): Oh. (Cocks gun)

308
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,642
Cecil:
So, trinette, as a prostitute,

309
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,907
how do you feel
about role-playing...

310
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,073
- Whatever fluffs your feathers.
- Please let me finish.

311
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,987
Where the story
revolves around Merkins,

312
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,306
mistaken identities, and incest.

313
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,376
(Both): Ew! And it's a musical.

314
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,595
No, you lumpy little pervert!

315
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,415
- What happened to not judging people?
- There's a limit.

316
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:32,649
Well, yes, of course.

317
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,735
That's why we would
have a safe word...

318
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,063
(Spooky voice):
That only I would know!

319
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:40,243
You're (Bleep) Weird.

320
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,743
(Evil chuckling)

321
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,368
(Archer chuckling)

322
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,548
(Laughs)

323
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,181
Oh, man. Never gets old.

324
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,747
I don't wanna sound greedy,
but maybe, if I'm lucky,

325
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,767
I can get the money
and get Figgis murdered.

326
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,821
Whoa. I...

327
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,852
I may have over-smoothed.

328
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah, definitely a little
too smooth, because...

329
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:06,157
Hang on.
Did I just open that?

330
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,595
No, dummy.
You just got here. Hey!

331
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,220
Come on, Archer.
Get your shit together.

332
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,884
Door wide open,
none of Trexler's goons around?

333
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,110
Something smells fishy.

334
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,532
But also... (Sniffing)
(Cocks gun)

335
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,345
Kind of like cuy.

336
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:30,226
I know.
It sounds disgusting,

337
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:33,125
but trust me,
it is utterly delicious.

338
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:35,820
(Spooky voice): And taboo!
Jesus Christ!

339
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,687
Your family tree must look
like a telephone pole.

340
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,211
Ugh! Seriously.

341
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,746
Okay. There's Archer's car,
the cops...

342
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:44,289
Park behind them.

343
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:46,893
And both of you wait here.

344
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,167
With pleasure.

345
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,337
I'm not staying
out here with him.

346
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:54,237
(Sighs) Okay. Trinette, come with me.
You stay here.

347
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,345
- But...
- No "buts!"

348
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,837
except yours, in that seat!

349
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:59,221
- Those...
- I know! They're homophones!

350
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:01,589
- Now sit!
- Oh, all right.

351
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,261
I suppose I could use this time
to constantly honk the horn.

352
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:06,718
(Groans)

353
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:14,526
Oh, my God! This place is amazing!
(Chuckles)

354
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,682
Sorry. I'm just
extremely wealthy.

355
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,964
And loud.
Now, shut up and...

356
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,022
Oh, wait a minute.
Why would the door be open?

357
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:23,487
(Quietly):
Was that rhetorical?

358
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,339
No. Now come on.

359
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:29,092
Because it could've been left
open for any number of reasons.

360
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,698
(Spooky voice):
Only some of which are sinister.

361
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,495
You are so lucky
I don't have a silencer.

362
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,768
I'm also just lucky in general.

363
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,479
(Distant running footsteps)
(All gasp)

364
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,120
(All breathing heavily)

365
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,346
Did you hear that?
Obviously.

366
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,243
Do you think it was
one of Trexler's goons?

367
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,794
- Oh, boy, I hope so.
- You know, as opposed to a ghost.

368
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,925
There's just so few of them
who are friendly.

369
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,393
I mean, basically you got...
(Distant running footsteps)

370
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,714
Casper?

371
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,729
(Squelching footstep)
What the...

372
00:15:58,953 --> 00:15:59,961
(Clicks)

373
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,464
(Groans)

374
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,667
Was that a lighter?
Can we smoke?

375
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:05,987
Shut up! And no!

376
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,518
It's medicinal.

377
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,620
- Ooh, gimme.
- Shh! (Distant running footsteps)

378
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,292
Stay here.
(Lighter clicks)

379
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,472
(Inhaling)

380
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:14,563
(Muffled):
Mm-Kay.

381
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:16,105
(Sighs)
Before this is over,

382
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,940
please, don't be surprised
if I shoot you.

383
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,440
Mm-Kay.
(Squelching footstep)

384
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,331
What the... holy shit!

385
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,979
(Sniffing)
Is that...

386
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,071
(Sniffing)
Marijuana?

387
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,643
(Chuckling) Oh, come on.
Give it a rest.

388
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,973
- Give what a rest?
- Oh, my God. Look,

389
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,503
how or why you did it,
I don't know, and I don't care,

390
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:36,084
but I know burnt pubes
when I smell 'em!

391
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,753
First of all, I... wait.

392
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,941
Why do you know
what burnt pubes smell like?

393
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,401
Because I grew up on a farm.

394
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,589
(Squelching footstep)
Oh! Son of a...

395
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,960
- What was that?
- Hold this.

396
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:50,667
Gonna do your armpits?

397
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,800
Huh.

398
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,893
That's not very Casper-y.

399
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,511
Do... do you think
it's Trexler's?

400
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:02,300
(Snickers)
Oh, please! With your luck?

401
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,932
Oh, sweet mother of Christ!

402
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,268
Wh-what the hell
is happening?

403
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,057
- And why the hell are you here?
- That's it?

404
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,307
No "sorry I shoved you
out of a moving frickin' car"?

405
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:16,768
I said sorry in advance.
And what are you doing here?

406
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,276
And, follow up, why do
you have a gun? Uh...

407
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,800
Because, you dick,
she's a... Trinette!

408
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,510
She means "Transvestite." I'm...

409
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,152
- What?
- I am not a...

410
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,826
Is that why
your hands are so big?

411
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:28,651
I'm not a Transvestite,
you idiot!

412
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,151
For the... we had sex!

413
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,276
Ooh. Yeah, but I
wasn't down there.

414
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,214
- Oh, I know.
- No, like<i> down there</i> down there.

415
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,117
Believe me, I know.

416
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,573
Well, that's not very Casper-y.
Poovey!

417
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,073
Aha!
Where's the money?

418
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,198
And the bag that contains it.

419
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,370
I don't know.

420
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,523
Well, then, I guess
I'll be on my way.

421
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,143
- Really?
- No! Aw.

422
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:50,848
Figgis, get your ass out here!

423
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:54,393
(Figgis:) No. I'm protecting
the ransom money.

424
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,198
(Chuckling) From what?
All these witnesses?

425
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,503
(Sighs)
Can't have anything nice.

426
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:02,198
(Chuckles) Certainly not clothes.
Stuff it, shamus.

427
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,870
(Clears throat)
Mr. Vandertunt!

428
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:06,323
You'll be happy to know
we recovered the ransom money.

429
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:07,682
- So...
- Well, the main,

430
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:08,945
thing is the bag, bud.

431
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:10,120
But, unfortunately,

432
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:12,315
all of this has to be
entered into evidence...

433
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,120
- Where anything can happen to it.
- Oh, right.

434
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,721
- So, can we...
- No, no, no, no.

435
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,237
First I need to count it to make
sure you didn't steal any.

436
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,159
On what possible legal grounds?

437
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,932
Uh, uh, citizen's arrest?

438
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:25,809
- Not a real thing.
- You wanna bet?

439
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:26,950
(Cocks gun) Do you?

440
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:28,091
- Kind of.
- Can we...

441
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,700
- Poovey.
- Huh? Oh.

442
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,310
- Lana, you wanna...
- I wanna talk about the fact

443
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,818
that we're standing
in a Cranberry bog of blood!

444
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,114
(Overlapping chatter)

445
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,757
Well, it is a full moon, so...

446
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,950
It's actually a waxing gibbous.

447
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:42,618
Oh. Then never mind.

448
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,669
- Were you gonna say a Werewolf?
- No.

449
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:49,935
- (Trexler wailing)
- (All gasp, exclaim)

450
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,786
- Or was I
- (Trexler:) Help!

451
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,614
- Holy shit!
- That's Trexler!

452
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:57,516
It came from this way.
Come on.

453
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,958
- Figgis, you lead the way. Go.
- (Overlapping chatter)

454
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:04,583
- (Trexler:) Help!
- (Chuckling) I... I hate to say this,

455
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:07,279
but... I almost kind of hope
there's a Werewolf.

456
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,154
Not even as a joke!

457
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,544
(Exclaiming in disgust)

458
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:13,661
Jesus Christ!

459
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,054
(Trexler sobbing)

460
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,576
(Sobbing):
Oh, please, help me.

461
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,570
I think I would've
preferred Werewolf.

462
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:28,451
Who... who did this
to you?

463
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,026
(Sobbing continues)

464
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,107
(Chuckling)

465
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:40,978
What's happening, gang?
