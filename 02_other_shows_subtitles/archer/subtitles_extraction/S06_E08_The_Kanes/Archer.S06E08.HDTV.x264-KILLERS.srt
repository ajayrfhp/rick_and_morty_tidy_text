00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:57,019
But just between us three,

159
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,920
there's no reason
to tell Lana about it.

160
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:02,491
No, she might not...
approve.

161
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,460
[inhales] Oh, God...

162
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,663
Okay, but just so you know,

163
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,531
I've never worn a condom, ever,

164
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,168
and Lem, obviously the implicit
agreement between you and I,

165
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,771
is that at no time
will our penises touch,

166
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,873
but I'd also appreciate it

167
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:20,709
if you didn't make eye contact,

168
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,612
you know... with me...
during...

169
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:26,835
Did I...
misread th--

170
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:32,821
I--
[Lana] No.

171
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,090
No. You do not talk.

172
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,459
In fact, first thing tomorrow,

173
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,928
you're going to the vet to
have your vocal chords clipped.

174
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,097
[sighs]
How about just put to sleep?

175
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,516
[Archer] Because who
gets in a hot tub naked

176
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:48,419
with an almost
complete stranger?

177
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,288
Because everybody!
Because Berkeley!

178
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:53,157
That's-- how does an entire
city get a pass

179
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,059
on acceptable behavior?

180
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,494
[Lemuel] Acceptable behavior?

181
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,329
This, from the man
who just tried

182
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:58,996
to have a threesome
with me and my wife?

183
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,899
I was being polite!

184
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,034
Wh--? How is that polite?

185
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:05,669
Because I thought
that's what they wanted!

186
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:09,039
They said they wanted to share
a special secret with me, so--

187
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,407
Wait, what special secret?

188
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,476
What?
Why is he even still here?

189
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,111
Daddy...
Look, the man's an ass-bucket.

190
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,514
[Claudette screams]

191
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:17,915
What the--?
Hey don't look at me, I'm not--

192
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,450
The baby!
Oh, shit!

193
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,318
Oh, dear God...
[Lana] Mom?

194
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:22,052
[Lemuel] Claudette?
I'm in here,

195
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,053
in the study!

196
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:25,022
Where's A.J.?

197
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:26,223
She's fine,
she's upstairs, but--

198
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,341
What the hell happened?

199
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,827
[Lemuel] Oh, my God...
my research!

200
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,529
[grunting]

201
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,133
[groans]
All my research...

202
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,169
my data, my notes!
All my samples!

203
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,437
All my years of work!
It's all gone!

204
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,940
Why would anybody want mildew?
Algae!

205
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:43,769
[car engine starts]

206
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,115
Oh, my God, are you shitting me?

207
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,439
With a baby in the house?

208
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,709
Why do you have a gun?
What, seriously?

209
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:58,091
For this.

210
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:01,825
[laughs]

211
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,794
[A.J. cries]

212
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:05,129
[sighs] Great.

213
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:07,031
Lana, what is the meaning
of this?

214
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,333
Why does he have a gun?

215
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:12,503
Okay, so-- 
Whoa, whoa, whoa-- C'mon,

216
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,039
are we not even gonna address
how amazing that shot was?

217
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:15,906
[Lana]
Not now, Archer, I'm--

218
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,875
[car door opens]

219
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,244
[Lana][sighs]
Shit.

220
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,212
Yeah, so listen,
if you wanna catch those guys

221
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,879
and get your
mildew back--

222
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,647
It's algae.

223
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,015
Yeah, take that tone.

224
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:26,917
You got a car?
What?

225
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,285
Yes,
but, but, but--

226
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:31,255
Get your shit together, Lem!

227
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,056
Be a lamb and watch the baby?

228
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,558
[car engine starts]

229
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:37,428
Lana, this is all just crazy,
why does he have a gun?

230
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,263
And why is he driving?
I should be driving!

231
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,265
No, Daddy, Archer should drive.

232
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:42,333
He's actually
pretty great at it.

233
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,368
[teeny tiny,
Beaker-like noises]

234
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,303
When he's not busy ejaculating.

235
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:49,240
Not in my Mustang, you don't!

236
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,308
But, seriously,
what's wrong with him?

237
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:54,445
Guys, this is, this is
the-- the car from--

238
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:56,714
<i>Bullitt, </i> we know,
and if you'd go already,

239
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:59,416
maybe later I'll dress up
like Steve McQueen for you!

240
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:02,019
Ew, that's not even
what it's about.

241
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,169
Plus your hands are too big.

242
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:04,755
Go!
But speaking of McQueen,

243
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:06,156
if there was ever a time
to wear the Tactleneck--

244
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,892
Go!
Okay! Hang on!

245
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,278
[Lemuel] Easy, easy!

246
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,730
[Krieger] Easy...

247
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:16,166
Easy...

248
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:19,036
Easy--
[Pam] Will you shut up?

249
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,105
We're only going
one mile an hour!

250
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,706
[Cheryl]
If that! Jesus...

251
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,642
Aw, shush and push!

252
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,277
You guys all better
be pushing back there!

253
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,505
We are!
[Cheryl] I am pushing.

254
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,946
Swearsies, realsies.
I push.

255
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:31,582
Son of a bitch...

256
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,618
then I dunno why this heap
of shit's not going faster.

257
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,587
Well, first of all,
I think you mean

258
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:40,190
heap of bitchin',
and second of all, hang on.

259
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,325
[brake moves]
[Pam] Wh--?

260
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,994
the frickin' brake was on?

261
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:47,097
[Cheryl laughs]
God--

262
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,183
Dammit, Archer!
[laughing]

263
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,435
[Archer] Whoo!
[Lana] Archer!

264
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,604
[Lemuel] You're going
too fast, you idiot.

265
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,440
[Archer] Idiot? Who kept his
life's work in his frickin' house,

266
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,475
apparently without any kind
of backup whatsoever?

267
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:01,161
Uh, yeah, that's actually
a good point.

268
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,513
I couldn't keep
my work at the lab.

269
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,448
It's potentially worth billions!

270
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,333
People would literally
kill for it!

271
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,085
[gunfire] Whoa, Whoa.

272
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,181
Case in point.

273
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,526
Well, even if I'm not family...

274
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:15,008
Oh, my God, okay...

275
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,461
What's the deal with this algae?

276
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:21,432
I found a way to use
it as bio-fuel!

277
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,434
Am I supposed to know
what that means, or...?

278
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,602
As a replacement
for fossil fuels!

279
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,137
Oh.

280
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:30,774
Oh, my God--
Duh-hoi.

281
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,491
[Lemuel] Under the right conditions,
the algae reproduce infinitely,

282
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,697
and the only by-product
of burning it, is water.

283
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,817
Holy shit, I'm surprised
nobody's killed you already.

284
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:42,030
[Lemuel] That's why I had to
keep my research a secret.

285
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,738
[Lemuel] Can you imagine what this
will mean to Big Oil? Or OPEC?

286
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:47,658
Well, there's no need to be racist.
How is the acronym

287
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:50,494
for the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries racist?

288
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,128
[Archer]
Oh, that's what that means?

289
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:52,830
[ALL] Oh!

290
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,998
Goddammit.

291
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,333
This is an American icon!

292
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:01,505
You Philistines!

293
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:05,376
Hey, I know, let's, um--
uh-- teabag Dr. Seuss.

294
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:08,762
Yeah, great idea. I'll hold him down.
Huh?

295
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,848
Look here, Archer, I've told
you about my research.

296
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,183
How about telling me why
the hell you carry a gun?

297
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:14,568
Yeah speaking of, I'm out.

298
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,320
Lemme hold yours
while you reload me.

299
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,404
Hold your what?
Uh--

300
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:22,109
Lana, come on!
<i>Zona peligrosa!</i>

301
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,911
What is he talking about?

302
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:26,530
[sighs]

303
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,416
What in the--?
Lana Anthony Kane!

304
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:33,003
Okay, so--
[Archer laughing]

305
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:35,339
Anthony?
After Susan B.!

306
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:38,175
Oh, right,
our ugliest president.

307
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,294
Lana, why the hell
do you have a gun?

308
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,045
That's not how we raised you!

309
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:44,181
[Lana] I know, Daddy. I know.

310
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,966
[Lana] So, about my PhD...

311
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:49,103
[chuckling]

312
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,804
How is this funny?

313
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,223
What, seriously?

314
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,196
Um, in every possible way.

315
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:05,638
[Lemuel] You're a spy?

316
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,163
[Lana] Yes, but I can explain!

317
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,779
Oh, you're going to explain lying
to me and your mother all these years.

318
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,599
and could you please
not drive my Mustang

319
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,268
like a complete
ass-bucket!

320
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:20,188
Okay, Lem, I think maybe
you're transferring a little.

321
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,774
You're not angry at me.
You're angry at Lana.

322
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:25,681
I'm well aware
of at whom I'm angry!

323
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,613
But thank you for reminding him.

324
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,519
Yeah, think of me as a mediator.

325
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,787
And spying for whom, exactly?

326
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,455
I hope to God
it's at least for America!

327
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,008
Who else would I be spying for?
How should I know?

328
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,793
All of a sudden I'm talking
to a total stranger!

329
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,628
Lana? How does
that make you feel?

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,297
Like I'm gonna shoot you?

331
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:48,316
Yeah, get in line.

332
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,935
Daddy, of course it's America.

333
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:52,887
Long story short, these days

334
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:56,274
we're sort of,
contractors for the CIA.

335
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,027
The CIA?
Did you just drop in on your way to overthrow

336
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,279
a democratically elected
government somewhere?

337
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,032
Lem, let's try to avoid using sarcasm.
I wasn't.

338
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,067
You see? This is why
I never told you!

339
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,486
[Lana] I knew you
wouldn't understand!

340
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,188
[Lemuel] Because you could've
been a great scientist, Lana!

341
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:13,106
How could you just throw away
your God-given talent?

342
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:17,785
But it wasn't my talent,
Daddy...

343
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,218
You and Mom just wanted
it to be.

344
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,170
Oh, come on, now.

345
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,671
You used to love going
to all those science fairs!

346
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:29,174
I used to hate it!

347
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,176
Remember, I always threw up
in the car on the way there?

348
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:34,262
[crying]

349
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,648
I'm sorry...

350
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,683
Oh, goddammit--
Lemuel!

351
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,151
[Lemuel] From excitement!

352
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,854
[Lana] From terror, but
I was always so afraid

353
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:45,023
of letting you and Mom down,
that I--

354
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,158
[tearing up] I couldn't
ever tell you how I felt.

355
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:50,862
Hey. C'mon, now. You could
never let us down, honey.

356
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,664
I-- I hope you know that.
[sniffs]

357
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,250
Really?
Oh, Lana,

358
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:58,336
we'll always be proud of you,
and we'll always love you,

359
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,456
even when you make stupid,
stupid, stupid choices,

360
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,542
like him.
Aww.

361
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,711
[Archer] Well, I think we've
made some real progress here,

362
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:08,930
and I'd say, we've got about

363
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,882
30 seconds before
the engine locks up,

364
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:14,969
so does anyone
have a plan? Anyone?

365
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,604
Guys, c'mon, there's
no dumb ideas.

366
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,489
[Cheryl gasps]

367
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,891
What if we grease the tires?

368
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:23,175
How would that possibly help?

369
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:29,271
Hey, yeah, toss out all your empties,
that will get rid of some weight, huh?

370
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:33,838
[winded]
Toss out... everything!

371
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:37,075
We've gotta get rid of
some of this weight!

372
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,109
[Cyril] Well, the speakers
are obviously the--

373
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,245
No!
For the love of God, man,

374
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:42,680
are you quite literally insane?
Sorry.

375
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,015
[speaks in Japanese] Shut up.

376
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,451
What about all these
bowling balls?

377
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,953
What? Yes, you ding-dongs!

378
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,222
Throw out the goddamn
bowling balls!

379
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,091
Okay! Jesus!

380
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:53,992
[grunts]

381
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,329
[glass shatters]

382
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,264
[laughs]

383
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,937
[sighs]
And that's how they all died.

384
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:09,157
[Lemuel]
That's your plan? To ram it?

385
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:11,326
[Archer] Yeah, it's
called a pit maneuver,

386
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:12,777
[Archer] I've done it,
like, a million times.

387
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,445
Like, three times.

388
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:15,914
And Daddy, when they crash,

389
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:17,115
they're probably gonna
come out firing,

390
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,667
so get down on the floor,
and stay there!

391
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:20,868
What about you?
Don't worry about me.

392
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,704
This is what I do, [gun clicks]

393
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:23,705
and I'm actually pretty
great at it.

394
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,290
Ehh.
Shut up.

395
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,225
Daddy, floor.

396
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:28,026
Okay, hang on!

397
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:31,763
Actually wait, hang on.
What?

398
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:33,898
Lem, what was the special thing?

399
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:34,882
What?
[Archer] In the hot tub!

400
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:36,684
Archer, I think the less said

401
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,769
about the hot tub incident,
the better!

402
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,554
Shut up. what's
the special thing

403
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,672
you two wanted to share with me?

404
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,607
The Kane family reunion!

405
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,058
Wait, what?
Yeah,

406
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:46,060
we do it every year, it's huge,

407
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:49,063
and we told her
to invite you, but--

408
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,816
Daddy!
Lana, the man may be a total idiot,

409
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,484
but he is the father
of your child.

410
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,954
Yeah, Lana!

411
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,789
So are we talking like,
a barbecue, or--?

412
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:01,035
Archer!
Okay! Lana!

413
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,501
And if it's a barbecue,
are the Kanes a brisket crowd,

414
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,676
or pulled pork?

415
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,779
Brisket.
[sighs] Lame.

416
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:18,609
[Pam] Don't shoot!

417
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,745
Don't shoot!

418
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:23,532
Please, don't-- Darryl?
Pam?

419
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:25,650
[laughs]
Oh, my God,

420
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,785
I used to beat this bitch's ass

421
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:29,787
at fight club, like,
all the time!

422
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:31,689
Sup?
Hey, guys.

423
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,891
Pff, like, three times.

424
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,659
Now, why the hell
you throwing bowling balls

425
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:35,893
in the damn street?

426
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:38,029
Long story, funny story,

427
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,452
and I'll tell you guys
all about it over beers

428
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,466
at the nearest titty bar, my treat.

429
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,606
Titties won't gonna fix my car, ***.

430
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:47,288
No, but Beard McBoggeyes over there will

431
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,073
and he'll install
a nitrous tank,

432
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,275
so you don't have to drive
around town like a giant pussy.

433
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,377
Won't ya, Krieger?

434
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:54,078
Yep!
Yep, yep, yep!

435
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:56,997
So c'mon, let's go make
it rain Pammy.

436
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,449
What about them?

437
00:17:58,518 --> 00:18:00,923
[sighs]
Honestly don't care.

438
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,533
Reloading!
Archer, cover me!

439
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,869
Wait, what?
Archer?

440
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,604
What the--?
Slater?

441
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,807
[sighs]
Ta-daa.

442
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,642
With a baby in the house?

443
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:27,011
We didn't know you were there,

444
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,981
which was obviously an
operational failure on our end.

445
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,883
Ethan!
[Archer] Yeah, Ethan!

446
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:33,651
And don't be shitty, Archer,
you dick.

447
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,653
You killed one of my guys.

448
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:38,322
Yeah, was that shot not insane?

449
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:40,124
What is insane is the CIA stealing
my father's research, Slater!

450
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,126
Why?

451
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,695
Because, Dr. Kane,
your research has jeopardized

452
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,597
our national security.

453
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,400
What? What do you mean?
How?

454
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:51,035
Because if you think the
Middle East is messed up now,

455
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:53,137
just wait until nobody
needs their oil.

456
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,567
Man, you guys
are so big picture...

457
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,741
No, wait, you can't--

458
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,276
that was a lifetime of work
for my father!

459
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,545
Yeah, yeah. Dr. Kane,

460
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,379
do you have online banking?

461
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,281
I-- yes,
but--

462
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,783
So, if you wanna go ahead
and check your account balance?

463
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,953
[phone beeps]
Huh.

464
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,655
Well, I can tell you right now,

465
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:11,756
this doesn't
come anywhere close--

466
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,791
That amount,
direct-deposited

467
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,893
every month,
for the rest of your life.

468
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:19,831
Every month?
Well, Mr. Slater, I--

469
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:20,565
I think we've
got ourselves a deal.

470
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:23,067
Daddy, no!

471
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:24,202
What about the algae,
so we don't have to burn

472
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,770
fossil fuels?

473
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,004
Honey, forget
about fossil fuels.

474
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,673
We're gonna be able
to burn money.

475
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,675
[laughs]
[sighs]

476
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:34,245
Happy?
What, like in general?

477
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,933
Because yes.

478
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,118
[Lana] So, listen...

479
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,719
I wanna thank you,
for trying to save

480
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:42,920
my dad's research,
and even though

481
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,822
I'm obviously
still furious about

482
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:45,723
the hot tub incident,
and will be, probably,

483
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,758
for years to come,

484
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,794
I can see how you--
you, Archer,

485
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,130
could have misconstrued
the situation,

486
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,931
and even though it's kinda
hard for me to admit it,

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
you are family to me,
and not just because of A.J.

488
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,640
and I realize now that I should
have invited you to the family reunion, so

489
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,474
I'm sorry.

490
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,089
Sorry that I hurt your feelings.

491
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:05,476
Well, thanks.

492
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,145
I accept your apology.

493
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,167
Sorry I tried to spit-roast
your mom.

494
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:22,778
