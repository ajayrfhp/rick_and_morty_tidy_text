1
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,662
Lana: I dunno, it
just feels weird.

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:06,664
Archer: That's just
the altitude, dummy.

3
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:07,679
Lana:
I'm talking about the--

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,875
Archer: Try popping your
ears, go like this...

5
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,747
Mawp, mawp, mawp, mawwwwwwp!

6
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:15,197
Goddammit, it's not my ears!
What?

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,934
Sorry, my ears won't pop.
[Sighs]

8
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,285
Ray, did you bring gum?
No.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,120
Well great, trip's ruined.

10
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,955
Sorry, Ray forgot
to bring gum--

11
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,924
I'm talking about the fact

12
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,126
that we're about to climb
a Swiss goddamn frickin Alp

13
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,095
to assassinate somebody!

14
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,963
The target's an assassin, Lana,

15
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,883
not a king, or a pope,
or a-- vice-pope.

16
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:37,887
So it's not assassination.
It's just a extrajudicial killing.

17
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,105
And that makes it better.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,940
Yes, Lana, that's why
they made up

19
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:42,225
a whole different word for it.

20
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,944
And the CIA told mother
the target has killed judges

21
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:48,281
and prosecutors and bankers
and generals all over the world,

22
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,915
so God knows how many
actual assassinations

23
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,037
we'll be preventing.

24
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,994
And of course your mother would do anything
to impress the CIA.

25
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:56,703
- So...
- Oh my God!

26
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,977
You have to try this!
Hot cocoa, dark creme de cacao,

27
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,279
hint of creme de menthe,
and peppermint schnapps.

28
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,047
I call it a Peppermint Patty.

29
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:07,049
Here.

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,051
Wow, that is your major loss.

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,319
Ooh, can I try it?
No.

32
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,888
How hard is it to remember gum?

33
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:16,058
[Sighs] Okay, so tonight we infiltrate
this swanky climbing party.

34
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,894
Then tomorrow we
extra-judicially kill this guy.

35
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:19,996
Yeah, or woman.

36
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,230
Wait, what?
Excuse me?

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,099
We kill whoever it is.

38
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,334
You don't know
who the target is?

39
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:28,037
I mean...
Ugh, God dammit.

40
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,940
And since you obviously didn't
read the mission dossier--

41
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,310
For your information, Lana...
I skimmed it.

42
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,946
And bully for you.
Give it here.

43
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,280
Ah.

44
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,883
God dammit!
Where the hell is it?

45
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,318
I assume on the back
of my toilet.

46
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:45,021
What, Lana? Look at all
the shit I had to pack.

47
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:47,356
I don't know what people are gonna
be wearing for apres-montee!

48
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,959
S--
And Ray didn't bring the gum!

49
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,994
[Groans]

50
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,329
Ah.

51
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:54,781
Witch...

52
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:03,272
Just like every car trip
I ever took with mom and daddy.

53
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,667
Only I'm not getting whipped
with a fan belt.

54
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:11,013
Lana, wait! I just remembered a crucial
detail about the target.

55
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:13,215
I made a mental note
of it at the time.

56
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,317
Oh! Oh, my...

57
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,953
And you must be
our late reservations.

58
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,922
Good to see some
fellow Americans.

59
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:22,124
I'm your guide, Crash McCarran.

60
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:25,027
Is-- um... I thought
there were three of you.

61
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,962
One of us is weeping in the car.

62
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,864
Oh. Uh, okay,

63
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,200
well, come on in and meet
the rest of the climbing party.

64
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,269
That's Hans Hessler,
from Germany.

65
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,870
<i>Guten Abend.</i>

66
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:35,905
Mario Savino, from Italy...

67
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,239
<i>Buonasera.</i>

68
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:40,242
And Michiko Ishikawa, from Japan.
Konbanwa.

69
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,912
We're just heading into
the bar for some gluhwein.

70
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,915
Why don't you join us
when you're ready?

71
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,050
Well? What's this
"crucial detail"

72
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,885
you remembered about the target?

73
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:52,354
The target was from a country
that in World War Two,

74
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,024
was an Axis power.

75
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,160
[Sighs]

76
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,353
Ray forgot the gum.

77
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:34,594

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

78
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,069
So... how'd you
get the name Crash?

79
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,397
Oh, it's a long story...

80
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,532
about me saving the lives
of eight other climbers

81
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:45,601
right after an avalanche.

82
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,368
Sploosh.
Sploosh.

83
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:50,538
Sorry?
Is I bet the sound an avalanche makes.

84
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:54,375
Uh, no, it's more like a freight
train full of tornadoes,

85
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,478
which are in turn
full of smaller freight trains.

86
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:59,024
Which are in turn full of shit.
Sorry?

87
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:00,315
She just had a baby.

88
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:01,483
Ya know...
I didn't.

89
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:02,684
Okay, well, we've got

90
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,385
an extremely difficult climb
tomorrow, guys,

91
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,254
so you might wanna
take it easy on the...

92
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,459
[Slurp]
C'mon, if you've climbed it...

93
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:13,194
how hard can it be?

94
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:14,496
[Annoyed sigh]

95
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,184
[Crash] Die Totenspitz...

96
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,470
For those of you who don't speak
German, that means...

97
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,058
Herr Hessler?
Ze peak... of death.

98
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:29,956
Fifteen thousand feet of some of the most
dangerous climbing in all of Europe.

99
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:32,617
Unstable seracs, frequent
avalanches,

100
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,164
and hundreds of crevasses

101
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:37,452
that can swallow entire climbing
parties in a split-second.

102
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,320
One in every seven climbers

103
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,656
who has dared to climb
die Totenspitz

104
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,575
has paid with his life.

105
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,627
So yes,
she's earned her name, alri --

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,984
[Slurping]
[Annoyed sigh]

107
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,466
Okay people, I want
a good alpine start tomorrow,

108
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,434
so pack your gear
and get some sleep.

109
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,898
We head out at dawn.

110
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,893
And that's A.M.?

111
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,573
As opposed to?

112
00:04:58,642 --> 00:04:59,840
P.M. dawn?

113
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,871
Set adrift on memory bliss.
Come on, buddy.

114
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,414
The mountain is dangerous...

115
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,616
Very dangerous...

116
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,914
So you should watch your step.

117
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:15,113
Okay, great climb, everybody!

118
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,521
Yaaaaaaay...

119
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:22,397
So, instead of antagonizing the
person responsible for our safety--

120
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,665
What, shamelessly flirt
with him?

121
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,533
Was it obvious?

122
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,569
Maybe call Malory
on the sat-phone,

123
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,470
and find out who
the damn target is!

124
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,530
One step ahead of you!

125
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,577
May I please have the sat-phone?
Rrrgh...

126
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,378
It's mother's fault anyway,
Lana,

127
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:40,315
you're obviously
the one she should've --

128
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,482
[Malory] <i>What?</i>
Mother--

129
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,251
Hey, it's me,
quick question --

130
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,485
[Malory]
<i>Let me guess --</i>

131
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,521
Oh, how's A.J.?
Because if the rash came back,

132
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,523
what she needs to --
Shut up, please?

133
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:51,392
Although actually yes,
how is A.J.?

134
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,701
[Malory] <i>That's why you called?</i>

135
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:54,696
Uh, no, actually
I'm calling because --

136
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,531
[Mallory] <i>You haven't
the foggiest idea</i>

137
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
<i>what it is you're</i>
<i>supposed to be doing.</i>

138
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,942
Ugh, I know what, mother,
I just don't know--

139
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:02,728
[Malory] <i>Let me speak to Lana.</i>

140
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,663
Who?
[Malory] <i>Lana!</i>

141
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,865
No, I meant --
[Malory] <i>Sterling, let me speak to--</i>

142
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,034
No! Because you're gonna tell
her she's agent-in-command,

143
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,737
so that when she's not pathetically
trying to make me jealous

144
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,073
by hitting on this idiot
beard-face sweater-model,

145
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,075
she's gonna lord it over
me and Ray,

146
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,571
who, by the way,
forgot to bring gum!

147
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,105
[Malory] <i>Are you finished?</i>

148
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,881
Yes.
[Malory] <i>Good, because...</i>

149
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,017
[Operator]
<i>The voice mailbox of...</i>

150

<i>Elaborate voicemail hoax</i>

00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:27,629

00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,300
<i>Goodbye.</i>
[Dial tone]

153
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,746
Huh.
I guess you had that coming.

154
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:36,153
Wh-? How so?
Gimme that...

155
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:38,697
And if I wanted
to make you jealous--

156
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,419
[Carol] <i>What?</i>

157
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,918
Shut up.
Let me talk to Malory.

158
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,327
[Carol] <i>Make me,
and also hang on.</i>

159
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:45,762
What the stupid shit
are you doing?

160
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,034
You said you wanted watermelon!

161
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,142
Watermelon's red?

162
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,351
Wh-? Yes!
How do you not know that?

163
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:55,008
Who am I, Charles Fedric Adrus?

164
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,524
[Clears throat]
She didn't come in today.

165
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:58,647
[Lana] <i>Well where is she?</i>

166
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,980
Well, I assume somewhere else.

167
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:04,256
It's like...

168
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,353
[Krieger] Yeah, right?

169
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:06,351
Ya find it?

170
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,423
No...

171
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,259
Find what?
Nothing.

172
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:11,427
Just don't make
any sudden movements.

173
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,296
Bowel or otherwise.

174
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,688
Wh-? Why would we make
a sudden bowel movement?

175
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,472
Don't worry about it.

176
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:24,140
Rrgh! No answer at home,
no answer on her cell!

177
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,542
So not only do we not know
who the target is,

178
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,312
now your mother
has absconded with my child!

179
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,301
Yes, but on the plus side,
there are seven of us,

180
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,484
so if one out of seven climbers
dies on this mountain...

181
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,780
maybe we'll get lucky.

182
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,601
Yeah, maybe it'll be you.

183
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:38,713
No, not me, dummy,

184
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,324
I meant-- oh, I get it.

185
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,459
I see what you did there.

186
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,595
Really?

187
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:46,585
Yes.

188
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,063
[Lana] C'mon, c'mon...

189
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:53,831
Pick up, pick up, pick up--

190
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,166
[Pam] <i>Mmblello?</i>

191
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,001
Oh thank God,
you're still at the office.

192
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,169
<i>I am?</i>

193
00:07:58,254 --> 00:07:59,971
Aw, maaan...

194
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,319
[Lana] <i>Pam, I need you to find--</i>

195
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,007
Yaagh!

196
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,042
[Lana] <i>Pam!</i>
What? Goddammit!

197
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,978
[Lana] <i>I need you to--</i>
Shut up!

198
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,179
[Lana] <i>--And listen!
I need you to check</i>

199
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:10,081
<i>Malory's apartment for me.</i>

200
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,563
[Crash] All right,
pick it up, people!

201
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,349
The weather's good now
but it can change on a dime!

202
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,568
Michiko, right there,
that's your line.

203
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,604
Now, stay on it, and work
across toward the ridge.

204
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,439
[Winded] Hai, okay.

205
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,491
Looking good guys,
looking real good!

206
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:26,443
Oh, this old thing? It's just --
Keep walking.

207
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:27,661
Uh-huh.
Yep.

208
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:30,447
Sat-phone?
Yeah, sorry, I was just--

209
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,283
Keep it handy. I'm getting
a majorly weird vibe

210
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,452
from um-- from
one of the other climbers.

211
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,589
Oh, yeah, no, just tell him
you're not interested.

212
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,624
No, not him, one of the others.

213
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,459
Yeah what's up,
what're we doing?

214
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,345
Uh, besides jeopardizing
the entire rope line

215
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,513
by being out of position?

216
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,515
Yes, obviously besides that.

217
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:50,467
Crash has a bad feeling about
one of the other climbers.

218
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,469
Oh, he's harmless,
just tell him--

219
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,471
Not Ray.
One of the others.

220
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,821
Aha.
And also ah-who?

221
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,226
Well, look,
maybe it's nothing, but--

222
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,645
Get down!
You're not my supervi--!

223
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:07,384
Oh, no!

224
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:17,494
Hang on!

225
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,797
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Hang on!

226
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,537
I got a key, ya skimpnuts.

227
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:28,618
Oh yeah, me, too.

228
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:31,450
Why do you have keys
to her apartment?

229
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,625
Ron gave them to us,

230
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,345
when they were doing
that weird open-house thing.

231
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:36,513
Open marriage.

232
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:40,450
Oh.
Well that explains that...

233
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,587
You both had sex
with hopefully Ron?

234
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,255
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

235
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,556
But I just wanna say,

236
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,392
breaking into
Ms. Archer's apartment

237
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,726
to hopefully find a crying baby

238
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,595
clinging to her dead
and shriveled body

239
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:54,264
is the best birthday present
I've ever gotten.

240
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,432
[Belches]

241
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,701
Except for that
Formula One team.

242
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,671
Dibs on snacks.

243
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,507
Looks like Pam's lucky night...

244
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,378
because of the snacks,
ya dickholes!

245
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:10,681
Although...

246
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:13,258
Michiko! Michikooooo!

247
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,880
I can't see her!
There's a ledge!

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,651
Hang on, I'm coming!

249
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,173
Do not move!
Don't move!

250
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,724
Everybody stay put,
keep the weight spread out!

251
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:22,693
I'm gonna clip on,
abseil down on a v-thread,

252
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:24,031
and try to reach her!

253
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,564
I'm gonna blip blorp,
blobba-do dob onna beep borp,

254
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,700
check out mah beard!

255
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,813
Little jealous?
Little bit, yeah.

256
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,751
No no no, damn it!

257
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,049
Guys, be ready
to pull on my command!

258
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,982
And we gotta hurry.
A storm's coming!

259
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:41,354
Um, should somebody
call the Ghostbusters?

260
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,776
Okay, here goes!
And pull on my command!

261
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,719
So, will your feelings
be super-hurt if I bang him?

262
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:49,936
[Gillette] Yes!

263
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,783
[Cyril]
No, nothing in the study.

264
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,978
Krieger, how about
the other guest bedroom?

265
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,137
[Krieger] No, nothing.

266
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,631
[Cyril] No sign of Ms.
Archer or the baby...

267
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,480
Pam, how about
in the kitchen? Pam?

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,467
[Pam] [Mouth full] No, nothing.

269
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,268
[Cyril] Wh-? You better
be eating snacks!

270
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:06,470
[Pam] Ew!

271
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,538
[Krieger]
Wait, yeah, where is Carol?

272
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,822
[Carol] Growrrrf!

273
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,452
Oh, God, somebody kill me.

274
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,400
We thought you threw up.

275
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,549
Ew.
Ew.

276
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:21,618
What're you--
Is that a radish?

277
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,720
And literally
the most fattening thing

278
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,288
in the entire goddamn fridge.

279
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,770
No wonder
she's so frickin skinny.

280
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,923
[Muffled] Everything
else is in plastic bags.

281
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:32,619
What was that?

282
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,631
Don't worry about it.

283
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,020
[Crash] Okay, ready?

284
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:39,161
[All] Ready!

285
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:40,279
[Crash] Pull!

286
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,656
[Crash] Okay, okay!
Ease up, ease up...

287
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,804
Was?! <i> Wo ist Michiko?!</i>

288
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,040
She's dead.

289
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,292
<i>Gott im Himmel...</i>
<i>Dio mio...</i>

290
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:56,094
The fall...
must've broken her neck.

291
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,391
Oh, my God...

292
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,881
Well, now, that could be very
good for us.

293
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,883
Japan? Axis power?

294
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,268
Okay people, listen up!

295
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,154
We've got a blizzard
rolling in on us right now!

296
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,856
[Crash]
There's no time to descend!

297
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:10,192
We've gotta bivouac
right here, right now!

298
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,943
C'mon, people, let's move!

299
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,979
B-but, what about Michiko?!

300
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,113
You mean her body.

301
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,865
But--
She's dead,

302
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,221
but we're alive!
And you never let

303
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,035
the dead jeopardize
the entire party!

304
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,286
Now, you would know
that if you were

305
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,579
an experienced climber
like you said you were!

306
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:24,702
You think it's Hessler?

307
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:27,209
Axis power Germany...

308
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,044
Axis power Italy...

309
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,997
[Inhales] Then yeah, I dunno.

310
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,248
Goddammit.

311
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,883
Okay, listen up, people!

312
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,168
Now, we've only
got two bivvy tents!

313
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,418
Ta-daaa!

314
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,005
And two bivvy sacks!
But that's okay,

315
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,890
because it's gonna hit 70 below,

316
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,059
so if we wanna live,
we're gonna have to combine

317
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:45,977
our body heat.
Wait, do huh?

318
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,929
So what we're gonna
do is strip down naked.

319
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,931
We're gonna go three to a tent,
three to a bag!

320
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,933
And I actually have some
thoughts on that,

321
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,101
who-should-go-where-wise!

322
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,854
We go wiss him!
Americans go zair!

323
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,272
Well, now, let's just hear
him out at least!

324
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,857
(Chuckling) As if...

325
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,108
No, she was totally in there.

326
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,827
Hurry up, dammit!
Get in your tent,

327
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,161
huddle up, and hang on tight!

328
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:04,946
The wind's probably
gonna hit a hundred miles --

329
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,119
[Ray] Shut the goddamn door!

330
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,949
[Lana]
What're you -- zip it up!

331
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:11,119
[Archer] I am, obviously!
If you'd shut up!

332
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,646
[Lana]
Wh-?! Nooope!

333
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:15,791
[Archer] What?

334
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,876
[Lana] I am not ridin'
bitch in this tent!

335
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,127
[Archer] You have to!
It's the only way

336
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,129
to keep Ray's genitals
away from mine!

337
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,798
[Ray] Oh, as if!

338
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:26,184
[Lana] Uh-uh, no. No.
Ray is the DMZ.

339
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,070
[Archer] [Annoyed
sigh] Goddammit...

340
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,338
Oh, please, I oughta be worried

341
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,840
about your dirty old junk
touching mine...

342
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,909
Ray, if I ever
have sex with a man,

343
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:37,079
it'll be a man
who remembers the gum.

344
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:40,516
And, not that it matters,
also black.

345
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,179
[Archer] [Winded, muffled]
Eat a dick, blizzard.

346
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,881
Can you see anything?

347
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,982
Besides snow?

348
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,817
Yes, Archer, besides snow.

349
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,152
Hang on...

350
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:04,997
Hang on...
No.

351
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,094
Well, now nobody's answering
their damn phones.

352
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,929
I tried Cyril, Pam, Cheryl,

353
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,164
now I'm even trying Krieger!

354
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,099
Where the hell is everybody?

355

Seriously, I swear to God,

362
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,920
somebody please come in here
and kill me...

363
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:35,156
I would if I had the strength,
dick!

364
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,858
[Cyril] What'd I do?
You poisoned us!

365
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,095
With that stupid ceviche
nobody asked you to bring!

366
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:42,897
[Cyril]
You asked me to bring it!

367
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,033
I didn't know what ceviche was!

368
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,968
Uh, hey guys?

369
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,770
What do you want?
What is it?

370
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,073
I don't think
it was the ceviche...

371
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,908
Huh.

372
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,909
[Lana] What, can
you see something?

373
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,110
Uh... yeah.

374
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,912
Well?
You wanna share it

375
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
with the rest
of the-- Jesus Christ!

376
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,129
[Lana] [Shocked whisper]
That's Hessler and Savino...

377
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,885
[Archer] Who I think
just did our job for us,

378
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:06,821
because we are
out of Axis powers.

379
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,988
[Crash] Mornin', gang!

380
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,857
Who's ready for a piping hot cup

381
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,025
of fair-trade practices?

382
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,093
What the hell happened to them?

383
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,861
Hypothermia.

384
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,095
No shit, they're naked
in the snow!

385
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,027
It's called
paradoxical undressing.

386
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:20,244
You see it sometimes
with severe hypothermia.

387
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,439
The poor bastards
rip off all their clothes

388
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,920
and run out into the snow.

389
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,272
With belts on their necks?

390
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,174
[Coughs] What's that?

391
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,911
Oh. Yeah, man,
that hypothermia...

392
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
make ya do some
pretty crazy shit.

393
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,015
But--
Irish bastard!

394
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,217
What?
What's that?

395
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,153
McCarran!
That's an Irish name!

396
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:42,890
Uh, yeah, Scotch-Irish,
but I'm actually Canadian --

397
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,226
Save the blarney
for the Colleens, Paddy!

398
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,894
What?
Archer, what're you --

399
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,229
He's the target!
What?

400
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,931
I just remembered,
from the dossier!

401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,868
Patrick McCarran,
mountain climbing enthusiast,

402
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,102
slash assassin!

403
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,071
Okay, first of all...

404
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,072
Lana!
Lana!

405
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,807
Yeah, that's true.

406
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,810
Although I prefer the term
"cleaner" to "assassin."

407
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,944
Well that's just smart branding.

408
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,846
And I'm actually Canadian,
not Irish.

409
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,081
As is that.

410
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,049
Those jagoffs
and the Japanese broad

411
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,951
were from Interpol.
They've been on me for months,

412
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,254
but obviously didn't
know I was on to them.

413
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,089
I sent her down
into that crevasse,

414
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,191
then went down in there
and broke her neck for her.

415
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,927
Those two, well that's
kinda self-explanatory.

416
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,061
They died in your arms...

417
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,637
Hang on--
Lana, hush.

418
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:23,964
Yeah, shut up.

419
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,967
I thought you three were just
some idiot wannabe tourists,

420
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,236
but now...
can I assume you're CIA?

421
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,006
No! You know what, Patty?
Hang on!

422
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,174
Lana, I said shut up.
I said shut up.

423
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,976
And I said hang
the frickin shit on!

424
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,178
Okay, God...

425
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,147
So where did you get Axis power!

426
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,849
Ireland?

427
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,078
Again, I'm actually Canadian.

428
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,986
And Ireland
was not an Axis power!

429
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,794
You sure?

430
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,127
They were neutral!
You asshole!

431
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,226
Oh, that's right.

432
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,862
(Chuckling)
Gaping asshole.

433
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,851
Because I dunno what your plan
was with that gun,

434
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:57,965
but there's about four feet
of new wet snow

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,967
on top of the ice crust,

436
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,136
so if you fire that thing,
I guarantee you

437
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,570
it's gonna trigger an avalanche.

438
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,382
Well Paddy, if there's
one thing I've learned...

439
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:07,629
Wait, wait, Archer?

440
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:09,210
It's that there's no guarantees

441
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,590
in this crazy world.

442
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,979
No, no, no--

443
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,918
I-- that-- you--
the-- that--

444
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,987
I believe the phrase
you're searching for

445
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,670
is "Thank you, Archer.
That was--" [Ground rumbling]

446
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,159
What's that sound?
What was that?

447
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,195
It's an avalanche!
You... you...

448
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,199
And I believe the phrase
you're searching for is...

449
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,746
Holy shit,
is that really an--

450
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,583
[Archer] Avalanche! Whoo-hoo!

451
00:17:55,925 --> 00:18:00,728
[Phone ringing]

452
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,232
And exactly what are you doing
with those bags?

453
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,234
I don't live
on the sidewalk, you mope.

454
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,034
Take them upstairs.

455
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,005
<i>[Lana]</i>
<i>Where the hell is A.J.?</i>

456
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,139
With me, she's fine.

457
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,008
I was having
my apartment bug-bombed,

458
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,242
so I took her to the Plaza.

459
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,111
I'll call you back.
[Phone beeps]

460
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,115
And what fresh hell is this?

461
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,250
[Lana]
Can you believe that shit?

462
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,408
Absconds with my child
and she'll call me back?

463
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,406
No, seriously, I mean
can you believe that shit?

464
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,589
[Archer] Can you believe
this other shit?

465
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,948
Peppermint patties!
Still warm!

466
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,100
Plenty more where
that came fr--

467
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,137
How could you possibly
be that excited

468
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,205
to be in a frickin avalanche?

469
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,875
I have kind of a weird
bucket list.

470
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,777
Number three, bang Joe Frazier.

471
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,979
[Sigh] Really regret
sharing that with you...

472
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,949
So, you think Crash
is dead, or...?

473
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,917
I mean, he'd have to be, right?

474
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,921
And either way...
I say we say he's dead.

00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,158
[Mumbled agreement]

476
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,193
Yeah, right?
Seems like a win-win.

477
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,228
Unless you're him...

478
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,897
or the other three.

479
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,932
But seriously, how in the hell

480
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,201
did you think Ireland
was an Axis power?

481
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,137
[Chuckling]
Oh, my God, I think this whole time

482
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,172
I was actually
thinking of Romania...

483
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,042
but only
as an inevitable consequence

484
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,978
of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact

485
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,113
and the Soviet
invasion of Bessarabia.
