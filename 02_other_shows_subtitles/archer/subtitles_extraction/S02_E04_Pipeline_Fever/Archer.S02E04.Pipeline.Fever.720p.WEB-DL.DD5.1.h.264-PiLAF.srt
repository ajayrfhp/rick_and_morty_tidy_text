1
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:03,966
ARCHER: Ahhh...
Oh man, is this great?

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,960
LANA: No Archer, it's...
ARCHER: Was that a rhetorical question?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,825
LANA: Archer... Archer!
ARCHER: And also was that?

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:11,757
Answer, yes, they both were, because
New Orleans is my kind of town,

5
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,865
and I haven't had a
vacation in forever.

6
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,838
LANA Well, that's great but...
ARCHER: Nola!

7
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,074
The Crescents City!

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,655
- The Big Easy... - Our mission is to
stop an eco-terrorist

9
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:24,743
from blowing up the biggest natural gas
pipeline in North America,

10
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:27,263
so I wouldn't exactly
call it a vacation.

11
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:29,378
ARCHER: Well whatever,
working vacation.

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,223
Cause I'm not too worried about some
drum-circling hippie tree-hugger.

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,531
STEWARDESS: Sir, can you
find your seat for me?

14
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:36,667
ARCHER: Yeah it's right there.

15
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,576
Can you go find some
more hurricanes for me?

16
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:42,578
LANA: Hippies aren't the only people
who care about the environment.

17
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:45,062
Like, I happen to care.
A lot.

18
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:48,152
And so does our target Joshua Gray,
aka Gandalf.

19
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:50,274
ARCHER: His name's Gandalf?
And he's not a hippie?

20
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,246
LANA: Gray's an ex-Green Beret,
and he's attacked nuclear power plants

21
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,300
hydro-electric dams, wailing ships...

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,475
Wailing ships? What?
He's against clean-burning lamp oil?

23
00:00:58,595 --> 00:00:59,772
Would you relax?

24
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:03,648
We know he's gonna try to attack the
pipeline, and we know where the pipeline is...

25
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,405
LANA: Yeah, running through
a couple hundred miles of marshy wetlands.

26
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,300
ARCHER: So mobility
will be key, Lana.

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,533
And how will we achieve mobility?
Huh?

28
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,942
ARCHER: An airboat, Lana!

29
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:16,251
Just like Burt Reynolds
in "White Lightning"!

30
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:18,406
LANA: Great, just...
ARCHER: Not to mention "Gator"!

31
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:21,870
Which, even though it's the sequel, I think
is actually the stronger of the two films.

32
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,749
LANA: Just try to
keep a low profile.

33
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,528
We could scare off Gray if we don't
maintain the element of surprise.

34
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:28,524
ARCHER: Hey here's a surprise:

35
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:29,660
this is Herms.

36
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:30,953
Ooh, and here's another one.

37
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,106
Remember Jerry Reed's character in Gator?
LANA: No.

38
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,594
ARCHER: Bama McCall?

39
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,180
LANA: No.

40
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,952
ARCHER: Well whatever,
check this out. I stuh...

41
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,255
borrowed it from Woodhouse.

42
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:40,556
LANA: Archer, what the shit?!

43
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,752
ARCHER: Right? It's just like in Gator...
SKY MARSHAL: Gun! Gun!

44
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,040
Drop it, drop it!

45
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,143
ARCHER: You drop it!

46
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,046
Lana, hijacking!

47
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,636
LANA: Dammit, it's not a...

48
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,870
ARCHER: Oh great,
there better be more of those!

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,067
SKY MARSHAL: Sky marshal!
Drop your weapon!

50
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,076
ARCHER: Oh! Okay relax, it's okay, we're...
LANA: Dut dut dut dut dut!

51
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:01,088
ARCHER: Sterling Archer and Lana Kane
of ISIS, and we're on a mission to stop

52
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:04,866
an eco-terrorist from
blowing up a gas pipeline!

53
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:09,213
So for the love of God, woman, go
make me a fresh batch of hurricanes!

54
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:10,283
LANA: Great.

55
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,553
Way to keep a low profile.

56
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,092
Thanks.

57
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:25,030

58
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:53,844
BACKUS: This is the AmPetCo gas pipeline...
Runs right underneath these

59
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:58,659
swamps, supplyin' almost twenty percent
of America's liquid natural gas demand.

60
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,932
ARCHER: Right...
BACKUS: But there's a pig launcher here...

61
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,303
ARCHER: Is that what
it sounds like?

62
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:05,045
BACKUS: It's a pipe inspection
gauge, for cleaning the pipeline.

63
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:09,525
It's the only section above ground, so
if Gray wants to attack our pipeline...

64
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,330
LANA: He'll have to do it there.

65
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,905
So we'll set up a defensive
perimeter at the launcher,

66
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,443
and catch him when he tries.

67
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,051
ARCHER: Well wait, hang on a second...
Can I get the oyster

68
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:21,026
po'boy and just like, a
side of crawfish touffee?

69
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:22,183
Cause I'm not sure
if I'll like it.

70
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:22,919
LANA: Archer.

71
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,369
ARCHER: No? Just an entree?
Okay.

72
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:27,175
Oh, so the po'boy...Hello?

73
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:31,090
ARCHER: Wow, speaking of disastrous...
LANA: Speaking of shut up,

74
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,430
think about what will happen to
those fragile wetlands if that

75
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:34,533
pipeline explodes!

76
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:39,248
BACKUS: Screw the damn swamps, think
what'll happen to AmPetCo's profit margin!

77
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:41,121
LANA: What?
MALORY: Big money.

78
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,130
Huge tax credits from that
hippie Democrat congress,

79
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,704
just for making a few
simple changes around here.

80
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:48,910
CYRIL: Well, a lot of
these aren't so simple.

81
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,886
Replacing all the lights with
high efficiency fluorescents,

82
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,048
putting lowflow fixtures
on all the plumbing...

83
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,495
PAM: Recycling old batteries?!

84
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,688
MALORY: Exactly, don't
we do that already?

85
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:58,716
PAM: Umm...

86
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,651
Prrretty much...
MALORY: Good.

87
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,709
Because I'm not leaving
money on the table.

88
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:15,490
So to get these freebie socialist tax
credits, we are going to make this place

89
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,663
lean and green.

90
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:22,144
LANA: Typical corporate bullshit Thirty
acres of wetlands disappear every day,

91
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,254
but all you care about is how much
natural gas you can pump out!

92
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,260
BACKUS: Hey, we're just
supplying a demand.

93
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,433
LANA: Yeah, AmPetCo's
demand for huge profits!

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,075
BACKUS: Well, some of those
huge profits are paying ISIS to

95
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:35,642
protect that pipeline... LANA: Which
I'm only doing for the wetlands...

96
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:38,832
BACKUS: Wetlands, profits, whatever...
ARCHER: Yeah, sounds like a win-win...

97
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,537
BACKUS: Just get out
there and do your job!

98
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:41,698
LANA: Yeah I will!

99
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:43,437
If you will excuse me!

100
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,560
ARCHER: I should go with her.

101
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:52,168
I don't think room
service is coming.

102
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,342
REMY: Shoulda called first...
Cause dat's the only airboat

103
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,581
around for fifty miles,
and it's reserved.

104
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,454
ARCHER: What do you
mean it's reserved?

105
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:00,092
REMY: Is dat not self-explanatory?

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,904
LANA: Look, this is kind of an emergency.

107
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,614
- Can we work something out?
- Maybe.

108
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,622
Maybe use that money to buy a time machine,

109
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,328
go back
in time, and be the first person

110
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,450
to reserve dat boat.

111
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,596
ARCHER: You sure about that?

112
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:10,551
REMY: Yup.
ARCHER: Good.

113
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,899
Cause I've waited my entire life
to say this exact phrase...

114
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,161
I'm commandeering this airboat.

115
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,815
LANA: Sorry!

116
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,486
It really is an emergency!

117
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:23,781
ARCHER: Of an awesome
and asskicky nature.

118
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,300
REMY: And some damn
guard dog you is!

119
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:31,454
Annie! Annie?

120
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,460
Aw, well that's just great.

121
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,241
Now both my dogs is dead!

122
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,754
CHERYL/CAROL: Stupid efficient
Canadian lightbulbs.

123
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,523
I can barely even
see what I'm doing.

124
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,559
PAM: What arya doin?

125
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:45,900
CHERYL/CAROL: I need
six more of these.

126
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,155
PAM: Why do you need seven?

127
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:49,608
CHERYL/CAROL: One
for each cat, duh!

128
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,480
CYRIL: For God's sake, Pam!

129
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:53,486
Have you no sense of decency?!

130
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,827
That bathroom's like
a, a war crime!

131
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:58,736
PAM: Don't blame me, it's
those new lowflow toilets!

132
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,812
With the old ones you could
flush a dachsund puppy!

133
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,587
I mean, not that you would, but
CYRIL: Well next time use the...

134
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,522
CHERYL/CAROL: Dut dut dut dut!

135
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:06,780
CYRIL: Women's restroom!

136
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,295
PAM: The what?

137
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,677
CHERYL/CAROL: Thanks, Cyril.

138
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,522
ARCHER: Woooo! Seriously Lana, this must
be what it's like to have sex with me!

139
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:24,580
LANA: How can an
airboat be selfish?

140
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:26,386
ARCHER: Nope!
Can't hear you, I'm too happy!

141
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:29,227
LANA: You can't hear me because
you're redlining the engine!

142
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,735
ARCHER: Thank you, certified
airboat mechanic!

143
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,674
Now where's the pig
launcher thing?

144
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:34,845
LANA: This heading, one mile!

145
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:38,589
But I'm serious, if you don't slow down...
ARCHER: I'll keep feeling this

146
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,295
incredibly vibrant and alive!

147
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,878
LANA: Yeah, right up until you blow
the damn engine, so...

148
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:43,004
Lana!

149
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,782
I am not... gonna blow...

150
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:08,732
Try clearing your throat about a jillion
more times, Lana, see if that helps.

151
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:12,037
No?

152
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,626
Nothing?

153
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:22,186
ARCHER: No no, by all means,
let me do it...

154
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,275
You just sit there like
the African Queen.

155
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,047
LANA: The African
Queen was the boat.

156
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,797
ARCHER: What? No it wasn't, it was Audrey...
LANA: Katherine.

157
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,806
ARCHER: Whichever Hepburn,
she was the queen.

158
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:32,867
LANA: Of Africa.

159
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:33,837
ARCHER: Yeah.

160
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:36,545
LANA: The white queen of Africa.

161
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:39,320
ARCHER: Yeah, back then Hollywood was
pretty weird about the whole race

162
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:43,767
thing... Like, Amos and Andy were white,
a white guy played Charlie Chan...

163
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,037
LANA: Archer... ARCHER: Pretty sure
Tonto was a Jew... LANA: Stop!

164
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:47,475
ARCHER: What? ! Gator?!

165
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:48,715
Gator?
LANA: Talking!

166
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,554
But I wish there was a gator!

167
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,727
ARCHER: Hey c'mon,
not even as a joke.

168
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,655
LANA: It so wasn't.
ARCHER: Look, I said I was sorry!

169
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,173
LANA: Tell all this wildlife
you're sorry when the pipeline

170
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,180
blows up because we're
not there to protect it!

171
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,687
ARCHER: A, all this
wildlife can suck it!

172
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:04,859
Every thing out here either wants
to eat me or give me malaria!

173
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,015
And B...

174
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,592
No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.

175
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:12,188
LANA: Would you, just...

176
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,280
Okay, let's set up a defensive perimeter.

177
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,666
ARCHER: Yeah, right after
I set up the grill.

178
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,638
LANA: Dammit Archer, will you...
ARCHER: Hey! I just dragged this

179
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,946
damn boat through a mile
of my three biggest fears,

180
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,386
so I think I've earned a kabob!

181
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:24,590
MALORY: Well, too bad!

182
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:28,401
Your lab uses more electricity than
the rest of ISIS put together.

183
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,153
KRIEGER: Yes, and I need
every single watt!

184
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:31,087
- No!
- But, but I need...

185
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,526
We all have to pitch in
to make ISIS green.

186
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,216
Loot at me,
chopping ice for a Tom Collins

187
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,495
like a field hand.

188
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:40,170
KRIEGER: But...
MALORY: Ooh, or do I want a mint julep?

189
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:41,842
KRIEGER: But the slightest
reduction of power to my lab

190
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,213
could put lives at risk!

191
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,543
MALORY: Lives of what,
a few lab rats?

192
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,066
KRIEGER: Also, yes.

193
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:58,392
LANA: Yeah, good, great idea...
Do the one thing that

194
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,797
could possibly make it hotter.

195
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,136
ARCHER: Ya gotta sear 'em first,
it locks in the flavor.

196
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:05,079
And if you're hot, and also
somewhat bitchy, drink a beer.

197
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:07,887
LANA: I don't want a
beer, I want water.

198
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:08,824
ARCHER: Your funeral.

199
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,896
God knows what kinda parasites
are swimming around in it.

200
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,207
LANA: Not swamp water,
ass, bottled!

201
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:16,981
Oh you are shitting me...
ARCHER: I know, right?

202
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,890
A rainbow should shoot out
every time you open it.

203
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,461
LANA: You didn't
bring any water?!

204
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,376
ARCHER: Where would I have put it?

205
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,554
LANA: Great, I'll just wait half
an hour for a cup of ice to melt.

206
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,588
ARCHER: Dut dut dut dutm dut.
LANA: Oww, shit!

207
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,368
LANA: What the [BEEP] shit is this?

208
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:32,309
ARCHER: No, no, no, Lana.
It's dry ice!

209
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,172
Hurry, put your
hands in the swamp!

210
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,906
LANA: Rrrgh!

211
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,220
ARCHER: How ya doin, buddy?

212
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:54,642
Because dry ice is something crazy
like, negative a hundred degrees...

213
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:57,360
LANA: I need you,
to not talk to me.

214
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,981
ARCHER: I know, and I know you're in a
lot of pain, so just try to relax...

215
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:03,623
LA: Why are you still talk... ow!

216
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,127
ARCHER: And say hi
to Sister Morphine.

217
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:05,929
LANA: Morphine?!

218
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,934
Dammit, I don't... need...
That actually feels waaaay better.

219
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,356
ARCHER: Yeah?
LANA: Yeahhhh...

220
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,108
That actually feels better.

221
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,251
ARCHER: Good, then get up.
You're sitting on the beer.

222
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:16,663
Alright, so wait a second.

223
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,366
LANA: What're your
three biggest fears?

224
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:19,036
ARCHER: Nope.

225
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,182
LANA: C'mon...
ARCHER: No, hush, I'm trying to fish.

226
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,475
LANA: No, don't shoot the fish.

227
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,582
C'mon, this is a very
fragile ecosystem.

228
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,688
ARCHER: Too fragile
to spare one trout?

229
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,988
LANA: No, but... ARCHER: Or bass
or whatever, what's in here?

230
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:32,372
LANA: Nothing soon, if people like
you keep destroying the environment.

231
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,072
ARCHER: Wh-?!
It's one lousy fish!

232
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,978
LANA: One lousy black rhino,
one lousy Bengal tiger...

233
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,630
ARCHER: One lousy Lorax!

234
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,831
Since when are you such a
radical environmentalist?

235
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,402
LANA: I'm not radical.

236
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,840
Well, I mean not anymore.

237
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,973
Back in the day, though...

238
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,683
HIPPIES: Fur is murder!

239
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,321
Fur is murder!

240
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,988
Fur is murder!

241
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,547
Fur is murder!

242
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,876
LANA: How's it feel
to be a murderer?!

243
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,431
MALORY: Shall we find out?

244
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:05,607
LANA: Lady, you don't scare me...
MALORY Dear, this is a forty-four magnum.

245
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,407
You're really not scared, are you?
LANA: Newp.

246
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:13,161
MALORY: Then how would
you like a job?

247
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:17,273
LANA: Three weeks later I was in
Tunisia, killing a different man...

248
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,246
And how and why is that funny?

249
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:20,952
ARCHER: Not that, I
forgot about that afro.

250
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:21,754
LANA: Hey, ya know what?

251
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,626
ARCHER: I know you looked like
Angela Davis had a lovechild

252
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,365
with Sweet Lou Dunbar.

253
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,605
LANA: Shut up... ARCHER: You shut up,
I'm trying to catch us some dinner.

254
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:29,879
LANA: Well, if you'd brought enough food...
ARCHER: I wouldn't have had room

255
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,620
for beer, and I since I can't catch beer...
LANA: Or a fish.

256
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,589
ARCHER: Yes I can.

257
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,660
Burt Reynolds is my spirit-guide.

258
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,833
LANA: Did you say man-crush?

259
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,474
ARCHER: No, I'm pretty
sure it was shut up.

260
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,815
LANA: What're your
three biggest fears?

261
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,054
ARCHER: Getting stuck on a
boat with you three times.

262
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,273
Ooh, here we go.

263
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,334
C'mere fishy, fishy.

264
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:53,767
And while you eat humble pie with a side
of crow, Lana I'll be dining on trout.

265
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:56,593
LANA: Waaaaagh!

266
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,562
What the hell is that?!

267
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,107
ARCHER: What the hell
does it look like?!

268
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,510
LANA: Shoot it! Shoot it!

269
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:03,915
ARCHER Oh, so now it's okay?!

270
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,054
What happened to your
fragile ecosystem?!

271
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:08,595
LANA: Screw the damn
ecosystem, shoot!

272
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:09,989
ARCHER: You are such a hypocrite!

273
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,567
I bet you probably eat veal!

274
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,458
Did you see that?!

275
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:21,189
And hear that, what is
that, what's that sound?

276
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,791
LANA: Oh you are shitting me...
How did you shoot the boat?!

277
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,656
ARCHER: Because I was bucking around
like a rodeo clown in a barrel!

278
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:30,328
LANA: Well did you
hit the gator?!

279
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,103
ARCHER: I dunno!

280
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:34,306
I mean, maybe...
LANA: Great, so maybe he's wounded.

281
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:35,902
ARCHER: No, he's
definitely wounded.

282
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,450
LANA: Oh right, I forgot he has an
arrow, sticking out of his head!

283
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,314
ARCHER: Yeah I think
that's what enraged him.

284
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:45,239
LANA: And so now all twenty enraged feet
of him is swimming around out there...

285
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:49,452
ARCHER: In that inky black water...
LANA: Into which we are currently sinking.

286
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,090
ARCHER: Yeah, it's not ideal.

287
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:54,266
I mean, even if we had more shells,
LANA: You only brought two shells?!

288
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,407
ARCHER: No, I brought
shitloads, thank you!

289
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,510
LANA: Well where are they?!

290
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:03,715
ARCHER: In the gear bags...
With your guns. And everything else.

291
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:07,284
Still got the cooler though, so...

292
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank God for small miracles, huh?

293
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,533
Lana. Lana.

294
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:18,941
Lanaaaa!

295
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:19,710
LANA: What?!

296
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,318
ARCHER: I said thank God
for small miracles.

297
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,321
LANA: I heard you.

298
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,715
ARCHER: I know.

299
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,376
LANA: Yeah, why dontcha
have another one?

300
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:35,480
ARCHER: Well, somebody's got to.

301
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,684
And since you refuse to help...
LANA: You don't need help to get drunk!

302
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:41,712
CHER: Oh please, it takes more
than some three-two... Or, wow,

303
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,537
six percent beer to get
Sterling Archer drunk.

304
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,061
Six, really?

305
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,788
LANA: Yeah, so lay off!

306
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:52,397
There's a giant wounded alligator out
there, not to mention a dangerous

307
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,622
eco-terrorist...
ARCHER: Holy shit, totally forgot about him.

308
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:58,197
LANA: I didn't... ARCHER: But that's
even more reason for you to get on board

309
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,117
with my new plan!

310
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,123
LANA: Is it as idiotic
as your other plan?

311
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,087
ARCHER: That's how
brainstorming works, Lana!

312
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,737
It's free-form, you come up with a lot
of ideas... LANA: Yeah, like using the

313
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,115
pipeline to set the
entire swamp on fire.

314
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,160
ARCHER: Which, yes, bad idea, but it got
me thinking about chemical reactions!

315
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,333
LANA: Like alcohol's
effect on the brain?

316
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:19,345
ARCHER: No, like the reaction
between solid carbon dioxide,

317
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:22,923
also known as dry ice, of
which we have plenty...

318
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:27,885
And a fun, sexy little molecule
I like to call di-hydrogen monoxide.

319
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,017
- Water?
- Water.

320
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,515
Combine them in a sealed container

321
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,978
- and you've got yourself...
- Some kind of dry ice bomb?

322
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,841
Arrgh, yes, ruiner of explanations.

323
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,629
I was building to that, but yes.

324
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,404
Well, we got plenty of water.

325
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,875
No, the swamp's too dirty,

326
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:45,376
it's full of whatever alligators shit out

327
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:47,496
- which I can only assume it's people.
- They don't eat people.

328
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,993
- They eat people all the time.
- They don't.

329
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,929
Last year, Sarasoni County Florida,
Chett Willer, age 16,

330
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,351
swimming in the Oak River Canal,

331
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,846
killed by an 11 footer.

332
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,997
Two years ago, *** County, Georgia,

333
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,802
Ruth Baker, age 39,

334
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,825
killed in her back yard by a 10 footer.

335
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:06,602
Same year, Pinellas County Florida,
Walter Jakes, age 70, and his dog,

336
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:07,992
killed by a 12-footer.

337
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,214
Three years ago, Dade County...
LANA: Archer!

338
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,226
ARCHER: What?!

339
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,101
LANA: What are your
three biggest fears? Archer?

340
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,230
ARCHER: Alligators,
by far the biggest.

341
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,131
LANA: And so... you've memorized
every fatal alligator attack?

342
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,117
ARCHER: Just in the U.S., I can't find
any information on tacks in China.

343
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,172
They only live here and China.

344
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,384
Two different species.

345
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,924
Chinese alligators are smaller,
but their bellies are

346
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:33,402
fully-armored so it kind of equals
out and... Can we change the subject?!

347
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,508
LANA: Okay, what's your
second biggest fear?

348
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,236
ARCHER: God, will ya
just... it's crocodiles!

349
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:39,904
LANA: Wait, do crocodiles
even live here?

350
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,568
ARCHER: Not here-here,
but in the Everglades.

351
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,793
LANA: That's like, a
thousand miles away.

352
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:46,227
ARCHER: Well, three years ago they
caught a 9-foot croc in the surf at

353
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,683
Myrtle Beach so, ya know...
shit happens.

354
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:49,493
LANA: Wow.

355
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,068
Not sure I even wanna know what
your third-biggest fear is...

356
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:52,492
ARCHER: Brain aneurysm.
- What?

357
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:56,221
LANA: What does a brain aneurysm have
to do with walking around in a swamp?!

358
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,447
ARCHER: Nothing, it can happen anywhere.
At any time.

359
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,782
That's why it's terrifying.

360
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,329
LANA: Oh my God... okay, okay, so if
the gator-poop water is too dirty...

361
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,386
ARCHER: Yeah, we need
distilled water.

362
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,238
LANA: Does your plan
include finding some?

363
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,051
ARCHER: Yes. But.

364
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:08,844
LANA: But what.

365
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:10,025
ARCHER: You're not gonna like it.

366
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:11,397
LANA: Do we have to
distill our pee?

367
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:12,868
ARCHER: I guess you
can if you want.

368
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,729
But I was just gonna use this...
LANA: There was bottled water

369
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,272
in there the whole time?!

370
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,345
ARCHER: Yeah, I just forgot.

371
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,581
LANA: You forgot.

372
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,618
Thanks, idiot!

373
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,895
ARCHER: What, you still would've burned
your hands reaching in here! Idiot!

374
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,302
LANA: I hope an alligator
attacks you at the exact second

375
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,640
you have a brain aneurysm.

376
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:30,991
ARCHER: How could you
even say that?!

377
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:33,317
That's like me saying I
hope you get cancer!

378
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:34,545
LANA: What the hell
is wrong with you?!

379
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,658
ARCHER: I obviously don't!

380
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:40,189
But holy shit, Lana... I pour my heart out,
and you just throw it right back in my face?

381
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:42,723
LANA: Sorry.
ARCHER: Well, you should be.

382
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,386
That's... wait, okay,
what's your biggest fear?

383
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:47,084
LANA: Newp.
ARCHER: Come on, I told you mine!

384
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,630
LANA: I know. You lose.

385
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,753
ARCHER: I think your biggest
fear is intimacy... LANA: Ha.

386
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,378
ARCHER: When what you should be
afraid of is falling in love

387
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,860
with me again because
of my awesomeness.

388
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,787
Check this out.

389
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,025
LANA: Wait, how do you light it?

390
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,231
ARCHER: You don't, the pressure
just builds up until it explodes.

391
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,167
LANA: How long does that take?

392
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,708
ARCHER: Depends on how much water you
add, we're gonna need to dial it in.

393
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:05,749
LANA: So you have no idea
when that's gonna go off.

394
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,710
ARCHER: How could I?

395
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:10,866
Aw, shit!

396
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:18,719
LANA: Asshole.
ARCHER: Did it getcha?

397
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,891
LANA: No!
ARCHER: Me neither.

398
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,682
Wow, again, small...
LANA: Don't!

399
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,492
ARCHER: Miracles.
LANA: Rrgh!

400
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,393
ARCHER: How long was that?

401
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,315
LANA: Oh I'm sorry, I
forgot to time it!

402
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,841
ARCHER: It's okay, I
forgot to measure it.

403
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,500
So we're both gonna
need to do better.

404
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,502
MALORY: Every single one!

405
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,943
To hell with the tax credits, I
want every last one of those

406
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,714
low-flow toilets out!

407
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,490
Dump them on the street with
those ridiculous light bulbs.

408
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,596
PAM: Why do I have to
carry the toilets?

409
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,499
MALORY: You know why.

410
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,731
CYRIL: Because of the things
that come out of your body.

411
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:47,568
MALORY: Oh shut up.

412
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:50,348
Mister Bigmouth, telling her
we have a women's bathroom.

413
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,760
Where I better never
catch you again!

414
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:53,392
PAM: Okay!

415
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,370
Jeez, hostile work environment.

416
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:57,578
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, so
everything's back to normal.

417
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,251
KRIEGER: Is it?!

418
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:00,285
KRIEGER: I told you
lives were at risk!

419
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,553
Now behold the horror
you have wrought!

420
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,559
And Pam? If you're dumping
stuff on the street?

421
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,366
This can all go.

422
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,825
PAM: What is it?
KRIEGER: Shattered dreams.

423
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:08,562
CHERYL/CAROL: Smells
like rotten meat.

424
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,389
KRIEGER: Also, yes.

425
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:13,285
ARCHER: Yeah, there we go!

426
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,325
Okay, I think we've got
the recipe figured out!

427
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,421
LANA: Yeah, that was
actually pretty great.

428
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,973
- Duh! - Shut up!
- You shut up!

429
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,260
ARCHER: Okay, I'll get dry ice
in the rest of the bottles,

430
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,249
you be ready with the water, and
we'll wait for that big fat

431
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,071
stupid gator to come back.

432
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,681
GRAY: Destroying his
habitat isn't enough?

433
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:27,643
What?

434
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,096
I would've been here sooner,
but you stole my boat.

435
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:32,912
Do you not understand how
reservations work, or...?

436
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,918
ARCHER: Reserve this, Treebeard!

437
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:36,422
LANA: Oh please, it's
not even loaded.

438
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,086
ARCHER: Wh-? Thanks Lana.
LANA: Shut up.

439
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:39,974
LANA: Hi, Josh.
GRAY: Hello, Lana.

440
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:41,186
ARCHER: You know each other?!

441
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:44,627
LANA: Josh was my Environmental Policy T.A.
When I was in college.

442
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,963
GRAY: And her lover...

443
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:54,880
LANA: Also, yes.

444
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,683
ARCHER: Wait, I thought he
was a Green Beret!

445
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,956
GRAY: I went to grad school
on the G.I. bill.

446
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:01,364
And that's when I realized I
had to lead the fight against

447
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,671
the systematic rape
of Mother Nature.

448
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,977
LANA: But back then you just
organized peaceful protests...

449
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,689
GRAY: Like that day at the fur store
where you disappeared without a trace.

450
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,561
LANA: I guess I kinda...
found my calling.

451
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:14,804
GRAY: What, as a hired gun for
the military- industrial complex?

452
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,513
A traitor to the cause of
environmental protection?

453
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,749
LANA: Me? ! What about you?!

454
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:22,226
Always running around, blowing shit up...
ARCHER: Threatening our supply

455
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,423
of lamp oil...
LANA: Shut up, but Josh seriously,

456
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:27,179
do you really think the ends justify
such violent means?

457
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,072
GRAY: Yes!

458
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,999
Because this is a war!

459
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,578
And victory will only come when Americans
will stop destroying the Earth

460
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:34,813
just so they can drive

461
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:38,483
bigger cars, build bigger
houses, and eat bigger food!

462
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,402
LANA: So like, never.
GRAY: Yeah.

463
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,733
Oh my God, that's depressing...
LANA: Sorry.

464
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:46,533
And I'm also sorry we can't let
you blow up this pipeline.

465
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:47,837
GRAY: I wasn't going to.

466
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:50,728
LANA: Well then why... GRAY: I mean I
was, but I saw you with this idiot,

467
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,020
yelling on the plane
about working for ISIS.

468
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,428
ARCHER: So technically
I saved the pipeline!

469
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:56,378
GRAY: Yeah, you're the best.

470
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,710
ARCHER Whatever, I win.

471
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,020
Suck it, Samwise.

472
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,986
LANA: Archer...
GRAY: So, you need a lift back to land?

473
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:04,889
- Yeah, lemme just grab my cooler and...
- Not you! Ass.

474
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:09,350
Lana? Maybe we can grab dinner,
see some Dixieland jazz?

475
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:11,191
LANA: That sounds lovely.

476
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,161
ARCHER: Oh c'mon, are
you kidding me?!

477
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,037
You're really gonna
leave me out here?!

478
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:16,100
LANA: Yup!

479
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:18,324
GRAY: I like your new
hairdo, by the way.

480
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,478
LANA: Well if you like the collar,
you're gonna love the cuffs...

481
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:23,946
ARCHER: Well that's just great.

482
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,926
She gets dinner and Dixieland and
laid, and I get mosquitos and no beer

483
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,266
and not laid.

484
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,718
How could this get any w...

485
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:35,193
Lemme finish, worse?

486
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:37,313
Now, okay see, you ruined it.

487
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:39,970
You ruined the moment.
