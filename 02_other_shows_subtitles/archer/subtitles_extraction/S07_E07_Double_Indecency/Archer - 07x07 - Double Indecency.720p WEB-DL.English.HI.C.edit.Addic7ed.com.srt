1
00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:04,651
You have no idea who this person is.

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,078
- No.
- Or what this is about.

3
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,304
Mm, no.

4
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:11,364
"Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00."

5
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:13,657
And you have no idea what that means.

6
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,413
I feel like I made that very clear.

7
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:18,805
Unlike this cryptic idiocy!

8
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,111
Why do you even bother to answer the phone?

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,239
Because you scream at me when I don't!

10
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,412
Volume! Jesus!

11
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:28,549
My God, Lana, you look like hell.

12
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:30,517
Like I've been saying for years.

13
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,721
Woman, you do not want to
light this particular fuse.

14
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,037
A.J. was up all night with the croup.

15
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,190
Did you give her bourbon?

16
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,260
You know, I was going
to, and then I realized

17
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:40,494
that, no, I wasn't going to.

18
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:42,062
Always worked for Sterling.

19
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,565
And you're just gonna...

20
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,234
- Yeah, too sleepy.
- What is this?

21
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:49,571
"Zissner"? Wait, as in Don Zissner?

22
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:51,005
She has no idea.

23
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:53,508
(growls) Which, again, very clear on that.

24
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,045
He's a huge producer. He makes those
massive, stupid, sharky blockbusters.

25
00:00:57,077 --> 00:01:01,036
Sharknoid, Sharknoid 2, Sharknoid
3 In 3-D, Sharknoid 4, Shark...

26
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:04,185
- We get it!
- Let me finish. Sharknoid Five.

27
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:06,720
(groans) Is that who we're meeting with?

28
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:08,160
Maybe.

29
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,391
Hm, "Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00."

30
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,094
That's all Carol told you?

31
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:15,363
Yes, we're to meet Zissner
in his office at 10:00.

32
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,699
- But other than that...
- We have no idea.

33
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,901
Or why she even bothers
to answer the phone.

34
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,836
Well, otherwise Mother screams at her.

35
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,056
(elevator dings)

36
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,230
- Good morning.
- Hi,

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,606
Cyril Figgis, Figgis Agency.

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,604
We have a 10:00 with Mr. Zissner?

39
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:29,252
- (coughs) Maybe.
- I'm sorry?

40
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,377
I'm sorry?

41
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,249
I'm sorry. Is this the Figgis Agency?

42
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,550
- Maybe.
- Then I think I have a 10:00 appointment.

43
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,985
I'm Barbie Zissner.

44
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,319
(together) Oh!

45
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,488
Oh, please forgive me, Miss...

46
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:45,325
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Zissner, of course, yes.

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,060
Mrs. Donald Zissner.

48
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:48,562
- Yes.
- (intercom beeps)

49
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:49,963
<i>(Cheryl over intercom)
Your 10:00 is here.</i>

50
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:52,832
I know. Thank you.

51
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,136
- <i>You're welcome.</i>
- (intercom beeps)

52
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:56,737
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

53
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:59,673
First off, killer marketing campaign.

54
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:00,808
Goddamn it.

55
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,511
Second, you've each been given a
non-disclosure agreement to sign.

56
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,515
If any of you repeat
anything said in this room,

57
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:11,184
I will skull-rape you so
hard, legally speaking,

58
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,087
that your
great-great-grandchildren

59
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,022
will spend their short, miserable lives

60
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,957
as indentured servants to mine.

61
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,125
Is that clear?

62
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:19,292
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

63
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:20,795
Third... (sighs)

64
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,362
I'm not really sure how to put this,

65
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:24,165
so I'll just go ahead and say it.

66
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:27,601
(sniffles) I think my
husband is cheating on me.

67
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,036
- That's so sad.
- Oh.

68
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,105
I think my wife is cheating on me.

69
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:32,439
- (mumbles)
- No.

70
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:34,975
And so I want to hire you.

71
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,718
To catch her in the act.

72
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,713
I'll need video confirmation, of course.

73
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,381
So you want us to follow him and...

74
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,117
No, not just follow her.

75
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:45,118
More than that. Much more.

76
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:46,939
There's just too much at stake here.

77
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,457
I have to be a hundred percent sure.

78
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,892
And so I want one of you...

79
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:55,671
- to seduce my husband and tape it.
- To seduce my wife and tape it.

80
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,966
Aw, man. Lousy timing.

81
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:02,248
My bush looks like I'm
sitting on Jerry Garcia's face.

Synced and corrected by johnyd13
~ www.addic7ed.com ~

84
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,576
Because A, it's super skeevy, and...

85
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,911
And B, possibly extremely lucrative!

86
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:47,849
She agreed to pay us $20,000.

87
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,752
And Zissner's worth God
knows how many millions,

88
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:53,887
so if we can wedge ourselves
into that divorce...

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,389
And he tells two friends.

90
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,291
And she tells two friends.

91
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,051
(together) And so on and so on and so on.

92
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,398
I thought you said the
divorce business was shabby.

93
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,698
If it's poor people.

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,475
So what, you think you're
literally gonna pimp me out?

95
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,705
- Who says she's pimping you?
- Why does she get to get pimped out?

96
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,739
I'm sorry. Is there another option?

97
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,474
- Uh, boosh?
- And-or kakow?

98
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,439
Pam, please, this is serious.

99
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,823
Uh, wha...

100
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,107
I am serious.

101
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:21,415
Cyril, come on. You can't do it.

102
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:23,618
Zissner wants us to prove
his wife's cheating on him,

103
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,191
not that she's capable of
aspirating her own vomit.

104
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,588
So what, you're going to do it?

105
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:32,259
Well, I mean, I think we should
put our best foot forward here.

106
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,795
Or at least our best five inches.

107
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,929
Hey-oh!

108
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,596
Who are you, Wheeler and Woolsey?

109
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,064
- Who?
- Typical.

110
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:39,934
So you're just gonna cheat on Lana.

111
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:43,003
Oh, right. Goddamn it.

112
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:46,307
I mean, even if Archer did basically
cheat on me with Veronica Deane...

113
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,607
- Oh, please.
- One kiss.

114
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,309
I refuse to stoop to his level.

115
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,444
Lana, it's $20,000.

116
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:52,814
I don't care if it's...

117
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,414
Okay, I almost said 20 million,

118
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:55,983
but obviously I would bang him for that.

119
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,985
Ah-ha! So you do have a price.

120
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:01,823
Yes, duh, but it's not 20 grand,
Ron Measly, so you can count me out.

121
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:04,291
Welp, guess I'm gonna need a bucket of ice

122
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:05,692
and a roll of gaffer tape.

123
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,595
- For?
- D-I-Y Brazilian.

124
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,870
When it's this bushy, the
clippers just get stoved up.

125
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,298
- Ew.
- Pam!

126
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:14,093
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know
I was going to get called up

127
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,970
- to the big show.
- Nobody's calling you anywhere.

128
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:19,071
I don't know. I think
Pam's got a better chance

129
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,042
of seducing Zissner than
Gluella DeVil over here.

130
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:23,611
Are you insane?

131
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,179
No, I'm dead serious.

132
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,980
I'll bet you my share of the 20 grand

133
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,783
that Ray can seduce
Barbie Zissner before you.

134
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:31,619
What're you... I'm not in this!

135
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,353
If we win, you get his share.

136
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,857
- That's almost $7,000.
- I...

137
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,471
- Where'd you get 7,000?
- I divided 20 by 3, Cyril.

138
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,415
Come on, this is pretty basic stuff.

139
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,564
Three. Tuh... what, we're just
not telling the women about this?

140
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:45,665
Why would we?

141
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,903
- Hm? Hm.
- Yeah, screw them.

142
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,636
Ray, come on. Be a team player.

143
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,337
We can drink you through this.

144
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,841
Would you have sex with a man for $7,000?

145
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:56,475
I would if it had a
negative impact on Cyril.

146
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:57,978
Wha... You hate me so much

147
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,180
that you would actually
have sex with a man.

148
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,381
I would date him.

149
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,184
And I wish y'all every happiness,

150
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:05,185
but I am not sleeping
with that woman, so...

151
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,895
- So then Krieger!
- What?

152
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,389
My share against yours.

153
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,892
I bet Krieger can seduce
Barbie Zissner before you.

154
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,194
(chuckles) You are on!

155
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,827
Yeah, I am all over that action.

156
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:17,398
Ha! Then it's a bet.

157
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,266
- I got I got Krieger...
- (Gillette) I got Cyril...

158
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,067
I've got Pam. And you've got Cheryl.

159
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,138
Oh, please, Carol
couldn't seduce a Spaniard.

160
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,740
Me, on the other hand...

161
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:28,276
(chuckling) Only if
Zissner's into archeology.

162
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:31,379
You little... All right,
Lana, you have a bet.

163
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:35,016
I'll take Carol, and we will
laugh all the way to the bank.

164
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:37,285
- And we're not telling the men?
- Why would we?

165
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,551
- Well, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

166
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:40,254
(Pam laughing) Oh, man.

167
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:42,890
I'm gonna seduce the dick off that dude.

168
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:43,925
(tape ripping)

169
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,393
Oww!

170
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,527
Yes, what mere mortal could resist

171
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,431
that cornucopia of nature's treasures.

172
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,766
(chuckling) Exactly.

173
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,434
- (tape rips)
- Ow!

174
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:04,453
Okay, so if anybody asks,
it's Cyril's birthday,

175
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,822
and he asked us to take
him to a strip club.

176
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:10,303
They'll buy that. It's so
sad and pathetic and Cyril-y.

177
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:13,240
Uh, first of all, I dated
Lana for three years.

178
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:15,107
She knows when my birthday is.

179
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,943
I think you wildly
overestimate that relationship.

180
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,856
With who, Veronica Deane?

181
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,649
With whom. And, no, not Veronica Deane,

182
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,914
who, by the way, Lana, kissed me,

183
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,944
and also when is Cyril's birthday?

184
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,988
Uh, how should I know?

185
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,577
- (sighs)
- Trick question. It's today.

186
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,040
And we're taking him to a strip club

187
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,327
because he is both sad and pathetic.

188
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,596
- Typical.
- Oh, man.

189
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,365
Give my regards to all the molestees.

190
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,966
Wait. Where are you guys going?

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,412
None of your collective beeswax.

192
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:47,085
Wow, that was way easier
than I thought it would be.

193
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,776
Although, I guess so is everything.

194
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,329
Krieger?

195
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,966
Krieger. Krieger!

196
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,357
- (door closes)
- (Krieger) Yep! Yep, yep, yep!

197
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,682
Hey, guys.

198
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,716
Shut up and brush your
teeth, comb your beard,

199
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,120
and get some cologne on those
balls. You're coming with us.

200
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,154
Done, done, done, done,

201
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,190
and where exactly are we going?

202
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:05,692
Well, first to buy you some clothes.

203
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:07,665
And then... wait. Where are we going?

204
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,529
Uh, let's see. Zissner said she'd be

205
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:11,798
at the "The Swindon Hotel for happy hour."

206
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,200
The Swindon? Nice.
Sunset Lounge or main bar?

207
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,869
Uh, let's see. It says here... "main bar."

208
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,205
So, hey, should I get some new clothes?

209
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:22,220
Cyril, the answer to that
question is almost always yes.

210
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,079
You know, Thoreau said, "Beware of all
enterprises that require new clothes."

211
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:29,482
Krieger, nobody gives a shit about
Doonesbury. Now, come on, chop-chop.

212
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,551
Ooh, chop-chop what? What are we chopping?

213
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,544
Nothing. You're going to have sex.

214
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,754
With a... person?

215
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,530
- What are you...
- I'm gonna double the bet.

216
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,077
- What bet?
- No, shut up.

217
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,390
I would think "person" was implied.

218
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:43,625
Yeah, no, I just didn't
wanna get in that head space

219
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,894
and then, you know...

220
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,196
No, I don't.

221
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,197
- Double it!
- No!

222
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,765
- What bet?
- (groans)

223
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:51,028
Okay, if you can seduce this woman...

224
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:52,139
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

225
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,036
And if you seduce her before Cyril does,

226
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,594
you get five, uh, hundred...

227
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,874
- Whoo.
- (together) Thousand.

228
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,143
- (laughing) Whoo-hoo...
- Goddamn it. Dollars.

229
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,777
I'm in. I can use the money

230
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,061
to finish my Voight-Kampff machine.

231
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,216
Or... not that.

232
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:07,763
Forget I said that.

233
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,653
Now, remember, Carol. The
key here, as with most things,

234
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:13,890
is confidence. Which
Pam's got by the shitload.

235
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,625
- (curtain rolls back)
- For reasons known but to God.

236
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,128
Well, a lot of it's the Brazilian.

237
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,929
They really make you feel sexy.

238
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:24,500
At least until the ingrown hairs
turn me back into Bumplestiltskin.

239
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,635
- B-ugh.
- I want to double the bet.

240
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:28,614
- (curtain rolls back)
- Deal.

241
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:33,143
- Damn.
- Just damn or daaaaaaamn!

242
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,125
Whichever is worse.

243
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,612
Damn, Cyril!

244
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,847
Really? You don't...

245
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:42,918
- think it's too much?
- I... You know, I think it would be.

246
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,347
- I wanna double the bet.
- No.

247
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,156
- Give you five-to-two odds.
- No! Krieger, get out here!

248
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:48,290
(curtain rolls back)

249
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:50,217
- Goddamn it.
- Five to one!

250
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,928
Dude, take it! I feel amazing.

251
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,764
And confidence is the key.

252
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,798
And Thoreau was a (bleep) idiot.

253
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,968
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
- (groans)

254
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,837
No, Lana dear, listen.

255
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,540
All this nonsense about doubling the bet.

256
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,322
What, are you trying to welsh on me?

257
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:09,212
- Huh... Well, now who's a racist?
- That's not racist.

258
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,346
- It is if you're black.
- There are black Welsh people.

259
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,246
- Name one.
- Uh, Shirley Bassey.

260
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,513
- Name 20 more.
- No, the bet stands.

261
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:20,957
(exhales) And that is just fine with us.

262
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,677
Damn.

263
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,526
I know. I look like a whore.

264
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,295
As a matter of fact,

265
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,298
I'm willing to double it again.

266
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,332
Um...

267
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,765
Psst. Lana, come here.

268
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,523
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

269
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,572
Take the bet. Double it.

270
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:38,707
Is this mirror not working or...

271
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,510
Don't be shitty. I'm in progress.

272
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:43,313
And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.

273
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,515
(sighs) Spanish Fly.

274
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,701
- Right?
- Pam, that shit doesn't work.

275
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:48,985
Yes, it does.

276
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:51,414
We just need to mix it
with some mole's blood.

277
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:55,091
So... hey, what were you saying
about un-doubling the bet?

278
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:56,692
Not a word.

279
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm serious, Ray. I'm about to punch you

280
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,561
in the face with your own fists.

281
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,998
First of all, you are a
mean drunk on germicide.

282
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,366
It's blue Curaçao, you dumb idiot.

283
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,068
Giuseppe keeps it in the back for me.

284
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,170
Well, then you're a mean
drunk on blue Curaçao.

285
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:11,234
I know. I'm actually banned
for life from Willemstad.

286
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:14,244
Well, their loss. Now, come on. Put
your money where your fat blue mouth is.

287
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,245
No, we're not doubling the bet.

288
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,047
Come on. Don't you have faith in your man?

289
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,349
Shoo, shoo!

290
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,638
- Shoo, shoo, shoo! Shoo!
- Krieger!

291
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,228
(slow motion) Shoo. Sh...

292
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:25,355
I do not, no.

293
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,429
- Well, I've got faith in mine.
- (continuing)

294
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,643
Cause he is lookin' muy Rico Suave.

295
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,427
Oh, well, gracias, amigo.

296
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:36,032
Pff. More like Rico... not Suave.

297
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:37,866
He said like a drunk jealous bitch.

298
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,269
I'm not drunk! Wait, I am drunk.

299
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,404
Cyril, you need any last-minute pointers?

300
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,640
Ha! From you?

301
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:46,542
The quarry may change but never the hunt!

302
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:47,943
Hm, let's see.

303
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,480
Oh, here's one. When
do I start negging her?

304
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:54,584
"Negging"? Jesus Christ,
what grade are you in?

305
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:58,654
Why don't you try putting some
Spanish Fly in her Brass Monkey?

306
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,223
(chuckles) I think you
mix it with mole's blood.

307
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:04,032
What're you... Where the hell
would you get mole's blood?

308
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,434
Why, you need some?

309
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:08,664
I need you to get your
big, bushy Bob Ross-ian head

310
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:11,233
out of your ass, because
we've got a bet to win!

311
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:15,438
And also, Giuseppe, I'm pretty sure
this is actually germicide, so...

312
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:16,505
- What?
- Damn it, Archer.

313
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,282
Yeah, that's... not great.

314
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,678
Although, silver lining... bet I could
eat a whole big bowl of germs right now.

315
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:23,145
(belches)

316
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:25,581
Okay, let's go seduce this broad.

317
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,618
Okay, let's go put some stank on it.

318
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,620
Yes, I suppose this is as attractive

319
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,255
as these two are ever going to be.

320
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,936
- Unless we can find some mole's blood.
- No.

321
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,327
- I have some.
- No!

322
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,861
Oh, wait. This is vole's blood.

323
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:42,636
I swear to God, you people.

324
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,048
Taxi!

325
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,105
(Archer groaning) Man,
I don't feel so great.

326
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,507
- (belches)
- Wonder if that's got anything to do

327
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,416
with all that germicide you drank.

328
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,944
Honestly, even if it had been Curaçao,

329
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:57,979
I bet I'd still be a little oogy.

330
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,949
No shit, you killed all your good flora.

331
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,855
Hey, Spirou, where's the main bar?

332
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,302
- Through the lobby to the left, sir.
- Thanks. Cyril, tip the young man.

333
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:06,889
Oh, uh...

334
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:10,360
Darn. (chuckles) I must've left
my wallet in my other clothes.

335
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:12,128
- Uh...
- Typical.

336
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,662
Here you go.

337
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,899
Here you go, ladies. Hotel Swindon.

338
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,369
Well, it's about time. Pay the man, Lana.

339
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:22,871
Uh, I don't... uh, Pam?
I'll get the next one.

340
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:25,207
Yeah, me too. Pony up, neckbone.

341
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,559
Yoo-hoo, bellboy, which
way is the Sunset Lounge?

342
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,107
Fair's 18.50, Miss.

343
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:34,844
Okay, so, do you have change for 10...
let me finish... drams of vole's blood?

344
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,317
Did he say to the right or to the left?

345
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,627
- I thought he said right.
- He said to the left.

346
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:50,033
- Thanks, Lois and Clark.
- It's Lewis and... oh.

347
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,852
- See what I did there?
- What are you doing here?

348
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,344
(overlapping exclamations)

349
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:57,624
I'm gonna assume it's some
sort of costume birthday party?

350
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:58,945
It's not my birthday!

351
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:02,095
Then why's Krieger dressed up
like Evil Nazi Bob Ross Knievel?

352
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,964
Why are you dressed like a prostitute?

353
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:07,120
- It's for work!
- Wait, what are you all doing here?

354
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,099
- Lunch?
- It's 5:30.

355
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,748
- Dunch?
- Mother, what the hell is going on?

356
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,359
I could ask you the same thing.

357
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:14,860
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing here?

358
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:16,707
- Mr. Zissner?
- What's the deal here, Figgis?

359
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,564
Wait, you two know each other?

360
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,366
Uh, well, um...

361
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,802
- Donny?
- Babe.

362
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,086
- Wait.
- Uh, what? - What the...

363
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,342
Why aren't you in the bar?

364
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:26,682
I heard all this commotion out here.

365
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,666
Why aren't you in the Sunset Lounge?

366
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:32,747
Okay, obviously there's been some
sort of misunderstanding here, so...

367
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,983
- Wait a minute.
- I think the best thing at this point

368
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,051
is for everybody to...

369
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,021
- un-clump.
- Did he hire you to bang her?

370
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,423
- Uh...
- Hey, no!

371
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,490
Before you answer that, remember you signed

372
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,664
an extremely punitive
non-disclosure agreement.

373
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:49,404
(belches, laughs) Yes. And also tape it.

374
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,599
- Goddamn it!
- Shut up.

375
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,200
And you were just going to do it?

376
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:55,103
Not me. Cyril or Krieger.

377
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,937
Ah! As if.

378
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,817
- I mean, maybe blondie here.
- As if.

379
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:02,167
Wait, but she hired us to seduce him.

380
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:04,397
- And tape it.
- Shut up!

381
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,417
Why would anyone do such a thing?

382
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,717
(sighs) It's your basic
cuckold fetish porn.

383
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:10,402
How is that basic?

384
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,687
In fact, I bet they do these
hookups in the same hotel

385
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,589
at the same time so they
know the other one's doing it.

386
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,024
Stop talking!

387
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,758
And they each go upstairs with whoever,

388
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,360
make a tape, and then go home

389
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:21,087
and watch them together.

390
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,575
Goddamn, I wish I was married!

391
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:26,401
(Zissner growls) You
are all so frickin' sued!

392
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,870
Shut up. And you were just gonna do it?

393
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:31,060
- Not me!
- Wha... Mother?

394
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,775
No, you idiot! One of those two.

395
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,042
(laughs) Who?

396
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,710
Scarrah Fawcett and Baby Huey?

397
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,245
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

398
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,580
- (sobbing)
- Uh-uh.

399
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,248
Bitch, you better 'pologize!

400
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,652
- (Pam bawling)
- Or what?

401
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,953
Or this!

402
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,921
(all yelling)

403
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:48,956
(roars)

404
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,791
- (men grunting)
- (Pam yells)

405
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,259
(grunting)

406
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,327
Aah!

407
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,598
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

408
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:58,700
(Pam screams)

409
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,137
Szhee!

410
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,105
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

411
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,573
(screams)

412
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,377
(giggling)

413
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,080
- (crunches)
- (screams)

414
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:13,315
(growls)

415
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,685
Come on, Lurch. Let's see
what's in that belly of yours!

416
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,953
Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

417
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,812
(woman screams)

418
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,959
Enter Sandman.

419
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,325
My eyes!

420
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,960
Ow!

421
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,695
Ow...

422
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,331
Damn it. What is this, a chair factory?

423
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,866
- Get everybody down here!
- (people groaning and grunting)

424
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,516
Baby! Baby, come on. We
gotta get out of here.

425
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:37,711
- Okay, honey.
- Paparazzi. Paparazzi!

426
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:40,175
- Aah! Damn!
- Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

427
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:46,009
- (thuds)
- (groans)

428
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,487
- (all groaning)
- I gotta say,

429
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:50,904
I think that went about
as well as it could have.

430
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:52,053
Tell that to Carol!

431
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,808
- Whoa, gross.
- Oh, God.

432
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,623
Oh, this is vole's blood.

433
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,693
- I hope.
- That's disgusting.

434
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,162
Well, whom or whatever's blood it is,

435
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,333
I vote we go rinse it off with a mojito.

436
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:05,366
- Come on, we can still catch...
- (guns cocking)

437
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,903
- <i>(police radio chattering)</i>
- Uh... happy hour.

438
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,299
<i>(radio chatter continues)</i>

439
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:24,032
Seriously, worst happy hour
ever. And I hate to do it,

440
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,502
but I have to trash you
guys in my online review.

441
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:31,087
Thanks. And also sorry, but I don't
feel like you've earned a tip, so...

442
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:33,002
Will you shut up and come on!

443
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,781
Wasn't six hours in this hell hole enough?

444
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:39,052
That bail is paid, and now I
would like to go home, please!

445
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:42,370
Okay! I'm not the one taking all
night to give me back my stuff!

446
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,744
No, you're just the one

447
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:45,826
who started the brawl
that got us all arrested.

448
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,747
First of all, that brawl started

449
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,403
when Carol messed up the messages.

450
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:50,911
No, I did not.

451
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,899
Zissner, meeting, office, 10:00?

452
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,184
What, were you being intentionally vague?

453
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,303
- Eh, duh.
- What?

454
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,906
I wanted to see what would happen.

455
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:00,806
- Oh, goddamn.
- Really?

456
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,675
Well, excellent work.

457
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,745
You just ruined our entrée

458
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:07,548
into the world of high-priced
Hollywood divorces!

459
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,982
Which, come on, we're better than that.

460
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,686
Shooooo, wahhhhh...

461
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,989
- Are we?
- I am.

462
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,712
I drank a whole big thing of germicide.

463
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,199
- Shooo...
- What?

464
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,020
That would've killed a normal man.

465
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,731
Shooo,
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo...
