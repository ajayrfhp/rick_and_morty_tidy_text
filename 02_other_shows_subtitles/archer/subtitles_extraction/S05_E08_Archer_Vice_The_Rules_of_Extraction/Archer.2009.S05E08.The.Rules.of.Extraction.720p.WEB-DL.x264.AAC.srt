2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:03,686
>> ARCHER: Oh, come on, how long

3
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:05,187
are you guys gonna stay mad at

4
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:06,088
me?

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,256
>> CYRIL: What, for getting us

6
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,591
all arrested for smuggling

7
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:09,926
cocaine <i>into</i> Colombia?

8
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:11,060
>> RAY: Probably the rest

9
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,061
of our damn lives.

10
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:12,929
>> CYRIL: Well, shouldn't be

11
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,130
very long, since we're headed to

12
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:16,132
La Culebra, the most dangerous

13
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,133
prison in South America.

14
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:18,134
(chuckles)

15
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:19,135
>> ARCHER: Well, Cyril, when we

16
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,136
get there and I join the

17
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,137
toughest gang, don't hold your

18
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:22,371
breath for a bid.

19
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,739
>> RAY: A bid?

20
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,141
>> CYRIL: They're prison gangs,

21
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:26,142
not frats!

22
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:26,943
>> ARCHER: And don't call a

23
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,277
fraternity a frat!

24
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,278
>> COP: <i>¡Callate!</i>

25
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,279
(Archer grunts, groans)

26
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,714
(cops laughing)

27
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:32,949
>> ARCHER: No, I'm fine.

28
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,283
Don't worry about me.

29
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,618
>> COP: And don't worry about

30
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,953
La Culebra, gringos.

31
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,154
You are not going there.

32
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:38,988
>> CYRIL: Oh, well, that's good.

33
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,989
Is that good?

34
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,157
It doesn't sound very good.

35
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,224
Why does that sound really,

36
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,225
really, really bad?

37
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:44,493
>> ARCHER (sighs): Because

38
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,494
they're gonna kill us.

39
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,495
>> CYRIL: What?!

40
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,164
(cops laughing)

41
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,565
>> COP: Unless you got maybe

42
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,168
$100,000 U.S. on you.

43
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,936
>> ARCHER: Well, not <i>on</i> me,

44
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:54,937
on me, but...

45
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,938
(cops guffawing)

46
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,939
>> CYRIL: Hey, but when we're

47
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,940
digging out own graves, they're

48
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:58,941
gonna get cocky, and then we

49
00:00:58,943 --> 00:00:59,942
whang 'em with our shovels,

50
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:00,943
right?

51
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:01,944
>> ARCHER: Cyril, this isn't an

52
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:02,979
episode of <i>B.J. and the Bear.</i>

53
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:03,980
>> RAY: That was?

54
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:04,981
>> ARCHER: It's the jungle--

55
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,182
nobody digs graves; they just

56
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:07,583
kneel you down by a ditch and

57
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:08,985
put a bullet in your...

58
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:09,986
>> CYRIL: Cow!

59
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,253
>> ARCHER: Why would they shoot

60
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,990
your... cow!

61
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,660
(yelling, grunting, gasping)

62
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,008
(birds chirping)

63
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:37,680
>> ARCHER: God...

64
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:40,116
(crashing)

65
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,062
(birds chirping)

66
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,565
>> ARCHER: ...damn.

67
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,836
(Archer groaning, chuckling)

68
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,238
>> ARCHER: Well, now I'm almost

69
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,073
afraid to say any--

70
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,209
(Archer groans)

71
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,278
Eat a dick, jungle.

72
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,252
>> CYRIL: Easy, easy.

73
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,220
Careful!

74
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:52,121
>> ARCHER: Cyril, for the love

75
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:53,089
of Christ, man!

76
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,090
>> CYRIL: Sorry.

77
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,291
>> ARCHER: You have to shut up.

78
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:56,292
>> CYRIL: I am.

79
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:57,293
Starting now.

80
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,294
Starting... now.

81
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,295
>> ARCHER: Cyril...

82
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:00,296
>> CYRIL: Sorry. (gasps)

83
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:01,297
(animal growls in distance)

84
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,298
What was that?

85
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,299
>> ARCHER: Probably a jaguar

86
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,567
excited about being magnificent

87
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,435
and crepuscular.

88
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,370
But I need you to focus on me,

89
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,206
because if, by some miracle, I

90
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,207
get the keys...

91
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,208
(Cyril gasps)

92
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,943
...and then, by some other even

93
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,911
bigger miracle, get us out of

94
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:16,946
these cuffs...

95
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,380
(Cyril sneezes)

96
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,116
I am gonna beat the shit out of

97
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,117
you, Cyril!

98
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,118
>> RAY: I'm gonna beat the

99
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,119
shit of both of y'all.

100
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,253
>> CYRIL: Oh, my God, Ray!

101
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,254
>> ARCHER: You're alive?!

102
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,255
>> RAY: What, did y'all

103
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,256
think I was dead?

104
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:28,257
>> CYRIL: Well, I just assumed.

105
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,258
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I totally did.

106
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,259
>> RAY: And you didn't

107
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,293
even take a moment?!

108
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,294
>> ARCHER: I mean...

109
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,295
>> RAY: Oh, screw you guys!

110
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,230
>> ARCHER: W-Wait.

111
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,231
What is in your mouth?

112
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,232
>> GILLETTE (muffled): Nothing.

113
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,233
>> ARCHER: It's the keys!

114
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,234
>> CYRIL: He's eating the keys?

115
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:39,235
>> ARCHER: Ray, don't you eat

116
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:39,969
those keys!

117
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,669
>> RAY: I'm not eating the

118
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:41,403
goddamn keys.

119
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:42,404
>> CYRIL: Waagh!

120
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,139
>> RAY: Ow!

121
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,106
>> CYRIL: What are you doing

122
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:44,773
down there?

123
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,474
>> RAY: What do you think

124
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,175
I'm doing?

125
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,176
(chain rattles)

126
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:48,177
>> CYRIL: Oh. (chuckles) sorry.

127
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,178
>> ARCHER: Do me! Do me, do me,

128
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,179
do me, do me, do me! Ray, do me!

129
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:52,248
>> RAY: Ow! Ow! Ow!

130
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,283
>> ARCHER: Sorry. Do <i>me,</i> please.

131
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,284
>> RAY: First, promise you

132
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,285
won't be mad at me.

133
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,153
>> ARCHER: I... Wait.

134
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,154
Why would I be mad at you?

135
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,155
>> RAY: Because you're an

136
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,190
asshole!

137
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,424
>> MALORY: I beg your pardon?!

138
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:03,926
>> LANA: Since Cyril's not here,

139
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,361
I'm helping Cherlene redline her

140
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:06,428
record contract, and I think we

141
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,429
should move on.

142
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,164
They're not gonna let you

143
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,198
kill a guy.

144

146
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,201
>> CHERLENE: Wait, he's a dwarf

147
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,202
now?

148
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:14,203
>> MALORY: He's missing!

149
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:15,938
With God knows how much of our

150
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,606
dwindling cocaine, and no one's

151
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,275
doing anything to find him!

152
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:20,209
>> LANA: If he calls here, my

153
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,644
plan, in its entirety, is to ask

154
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,645
him where he is.

calling <i>him?</i>

172
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:38,961
>> LANA: I can't! It's...

173
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:39,795
>> ARCHER: Ar-Ar-Archer. Archer.

174
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:40,629
>> KRIEGER: Rrgh! Rrgh! Rrgh!

175
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,230
>> ARCHER: (voice slows):

176
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,331
Archer... Archer...

177
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,232
>> PAM & CHERLENE: Aw.

178
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,233
>> KRIEGER: Okay, so he forwards

179
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:45,234
his phone here.

180
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,535
That's easy.

181
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,536
Then he taps the phone line into

182
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,871
the intercom.

183
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,872
They're both low-voltage.

184
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,207
No big deal, but that's patched

185
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,008
into the actual house wiring,

186
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,877
obviously one-ten AC, which

187
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,245
means he must have wired a

188
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,646
transformer in the circuit

189
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,814
somewhere, but he's got all

190
00:04:58,816 --> 00:04:59,982
these fake wires in here that

191
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:01,250
don't connect to any...

192
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:02,351
(Malory sobs)

193
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:03,752
>> MALORY: Is this all just a

194
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,688
game to you people?!

195
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,257
My God, I'm broke, my husband

196
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,059
kicked me out of my own home,

197
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,260
we're running out of cocaine,

198
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,995
and on top of all that, my son

199
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,430
is missing!

200
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,698
>> LANA: Um, okay, if Archer

201
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,032
calls, I'll...

202
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,334
>> MALORY: No, please don't

203
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,435
disturb me.

204
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:20,436
I think I'm getting a migraine.

205
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:21,704
(whistle blows)

206
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,038
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country!

207
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,340
Wooooooooooooooo!

208
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:25,774
>> MALORY: I honestly don't know

209
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,710
how much more I can take!

210
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:29,278
(Cherlene chuckles)

211
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,247
>> LANA: Wow. I think she

212
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,048
seriously might be, like,

213
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,583
nearing the end of her rope.

214
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,385
>> PAM: Hey, speaking of rope...

215
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,354
>> LANA: You want cocaine?

216
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:39,455
>> PAM: Yay!

217
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:40,456
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it!

218
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,724
>> RAY: How is this my

219
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,058
fault?

220
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,360
>> ARCHER: Because why do you

221
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,461
always get paralyzed?!

222
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:46,462
>> RAY: Because why do you

223
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:47,863
always crash every goddamn

224
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,231
vehicle I get in?!

225
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,266
>> ARCHER: I didn't crash it!

226
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,267
That crooked idiot, drunk

227
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,534
murdering cop did!

228
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:53,869
>> CYRIL: Uh, yeah, speaking

229
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,237
of, these guys don't look too

230
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,272
good.

231
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,273
(cop coughs very weakly)

232
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,274
>> ARCHER: Well, they're gonna

233
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,275
look even worse when they're

234
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,542
jaguar poop!

235
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,543
>> CYRIL: What? We can't just

236
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:02,878
leave them here.

237
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,879
>> ARCHER: As opposed to what,

238
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,247
Cyril?!

239
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,248
You and I sling them over our

240
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,249
shoulders and climb 200 feet

241
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,250
straight up a cliff without

242
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:09,285
a goddamn rope?!

243
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,286
>> CYRIL: I...

244
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,287
>> RAY: Wait. Where am I in

245
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,288
that scenario?!

246
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,289
>> ARCHER: I guess getting

247
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,290
pooped out of a jaguar!

248
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,291
>> CYRIL: Well, we definitely

249
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,292
can't leave Ray!

250
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,293
>> ARCHER: We have to!

251
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,294
Ray, I'm sorry.

252
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,295
>> RAY: No, you're not!

253
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,296
>> ARCHER: I am, actually,

254
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,297
which, whatever, but...

255
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,564
(gun cocks)

256
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,565
>> CYRIL: We are not leaving

257
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,900
Ray!

258
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:25,901
>> ARCHER: What do you even

259
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,269
think you're doing?

260
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,304
>> CYRIL: I am taking command!

261
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:32,474
(Archer and Cyril laugh)

262
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,843
>> CYRIL: Hey, I'm serious!

263
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,145
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God.

264
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,513
Okay.

265
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:38,580
Oh, that's really funny.

266
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:39,581
Thanks, Cyril.

267
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,916
I-I think we needed that.

268
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:42,284
>> RAY: We did.

269
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:43,319
We really did.

270
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,320
>> ARCHER: Oh, man.

271
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,588
Now give me the goddamn weapon.

272
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,923
>> ARCHER: You nut!

273
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,291
(Cyril laughs)

274
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,326
>> CYRIL: Thought you were gonna

275
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,327
hit me with it.

276
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,594
>> ARCHER: I was.

277
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,296
Okay, so how do we get Ray and

278
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,531
his useless legs out of here?

279
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,598
>> RAY: Well, now, I

280
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,599
actually have some thoughts on

281
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:58,934
that.

282
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,337
>> ARCHER (sighing): Goddamn it.

283
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,371
>> RAY: I think it's a

284
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:03,872
pretty good plan, y'all.

285
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:05,341
>> ARCHER: No, it isn't!

286
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,343
We might as well slather

287
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,610
ourselves with whatever it is

288
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,313
crocodiles eat, and swim down!

289
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,348
>> CYRIL: What do crocodiles

290
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,549
eat?

291
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,550
>> ARCHER: Everything!

292
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,386
They eat everything!

293
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:20,222
And fear is their bacon bits.

294
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,964
>> CHERLENE: I don't understand

295
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:30,332
what you're saying.

296
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,567
>> LANA: Damn it!

297
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:32,634
Look, I think Malory is

298
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:33,569
genuinely going through a really

299
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:34,636
hard time right now, so I think

300
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,637
we should do something nice for

301
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,972
her.

302
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:37,973
>> CHERLENE: I don't understand

303
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,341
what you're say...

304
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,376
>> LANA: Goddamn it!

305
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,377
>> PAM: I'm with you, Lana.

306
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,378
It freaked me out seeing her cry

307
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,379
like that.

308
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,646
It was like seeing my dad cry.

309
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,415
>> LANA: Crying because...?

310
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,384
>> PAM: (splutters) Name it.

311
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,385
He's a gigantic pussy.

312
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,387
Oh, my God, when my mom died?

313
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,388
Hey, and speaking of pussies...

314
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,655
>> LANA: A Long Island Iced Tea?

315
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:54,990
I'm not even supposed to drink

316
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,358
regular iced tea.

317
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,393
>> PAM: Yeah, this is a Long

318
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,394
Island.

319
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,661
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, stupid!

320
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:00,996
Your words.

321
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:02,364
>> LANA: Shut up!

322
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,365
And, okay, so what would cheer

323
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,400
Malory up?

324
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,401
What does she like?

325
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,402
>> PAM: Archer and money and

326
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,669
liquor.

327
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,004
>> LANA: Besides that.

328
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,372
>> CHERLENE: Some different

329
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:11,507
liquor.

330
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,374
>> PAM: You know what always

331
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,409
cheers me up...

332
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,443

333
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,411
cocaine.

00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,679
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, stup... Ow!

336
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,014
>> LANA: You done?

337
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,382
>> CHERLENE: I am. Thank you.

338
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:21,417
>> LANA: Ass. And Pam, that's

339
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,418
not a bad idea.

340
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,685
>> PAM: Hmm. I don't know if I'd

341
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,020
be comfortable with that.

342
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,388
I mean, even for me, it's...

343
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,423
>> LANA: Let me stop you before

344
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,691
you say what it is you think I'm

345
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,026
talking about.

346
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,394
>> PAM: Getting shitty drunk on

347
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:33,395
two different kinds of liquor,

348
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:34,630
dressing up like Mr. Archer,

349
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:35,697
and banging the old lady with

350
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:36,698
a strap...

351
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,033
Ow!

352
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,034
>> LANA: That's not what I had

353
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:40,402
in mind.

354
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:41,403
>> PAM: Okay, good, 'cause the

355
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,404
the dressing up like Mr. Archer

356
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:43,439
part makes it kind of weird.

357
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,440
>> LANA: I...

358
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,707
>> PAM: I'd have to be super

359
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,875
drunk, like so drunk I bet I

360
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,710
wouldn't even enjoy...! Ow!

361
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,045
(Pam clears her throat)

362
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:53,248
Okay, so what's <i>your</i> plan?

363
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,249
>> CYRIL: Well, eventually, we

364
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,250
have to come to a village or

365
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:56,418
whatever, and maybe we can

366
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,419
barter with them for a ride,

367
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,454
or...

368
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,455
>> ARCHER: Barter with what,

369
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:00,722
Cyril?

370
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:01,723
>> CYRIL: I don't know.

371
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:02,724
Maybe the gun, or...

372
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,725
>> ARCHER (laughing): Yes!

373
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,060
Great idea, yeah, Cyril.

374
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:06,428
Let's give an M-16 to a bunch of

375
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,463
wild Indians!

376
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,464
>> CYRIL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

377
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,465
>> RAY: Goddamn,

378
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,732
Huckleberry Finn!

379
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:11,733
>> ARCHER: What?! I don't think

380
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:12,734
it's racist to assume that a

381
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:13,735
previously uncontacted tribe of

382
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:15,504
indigenous peoples might react

383
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,506
unpredictably, perhaps even

384
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,741
wildly, to a bunch of white guys

385
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,610
who walk up and hand 'em a

386
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:22,644
goddamn M-16!

387
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,912
>> CYRIL: Oh, okay.

388
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:24,913
I didn't know in your scenario

389
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:25,914
the indigenous people were

390
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,249
uncontacted.

391
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,250
>> RAY: Totally different

392
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,518
scenario.

393
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,519
>> CYRIL: In which, no, you

394
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,520
obviously wouldn't just want to

395
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,621
hand them an M-16.

396
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,755
>> RAY: 'Cause they'd be,

397
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:34,656
like, "What?!"

398
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,657
Or whatever their word for that

399
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,260
is.

400
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:39,528
>> MALORY: What?

401
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,629
>> LANA: A spa day!

402
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,663
>> MALORY: What? No.

403
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,931
I can't go out like this.

404
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,266
>> LANA: No, no, no!

405
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:45,534
That's the best part.

406
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,635
It's here!

407
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:47,636
>> MALORY: Then it's not a spa

408
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:48,670
day.

409
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,671
It's just a bath!

410
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,672
I want to go back to sleep!

411
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,673
>> LANA: Well, after this,

412
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,941
you'll be so relaxed.

413
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:53,942
>> MALORY: I took three Valium!

414
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:54,943
If I get any more relaxed,

415
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:56,278
I will literally die.

416
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,546
>> LANA: Okay, well, that's also

417
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,047
good... because you may not

418
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,949
actually find this to be all

419
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:02,284
that relaxing.

420
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,552
>> MALORY: What the...?

421
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,653
Why are they dressed like that?

422
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:05,687
>> LANA (sighing): That was the

423
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,955
only way they'd do it.

424
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:08,290
>> CHERLENE: Strip!

425
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,492
>> PAM: Yay!

426
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:11,527
>> CYRIL: Wait. What?

427
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,795
>> ARCHER: <i>Crocodylus acutus!</i>

428
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,130
And maybe even...

429
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,498
Are we in the Orinoco drainage

430
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,733
basin?

431
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:18,800
>> CYRIL: How should I know?

432
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:19,801
>> ARCHER: Okay, so maybe

433
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,136
 <i>Crocodylus intermedius</i> is in

434
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,504
play!

435
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:23,539
Not to mention four kinds of

436
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,806
caiman, including the Black

437
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,141
Caiman, which can grow up to

438
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:27,509
22 feet!

439
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,544
>> RAY: Is that why you're

440
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,545
up on those goddamn cans?

441
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,812
>> ARCHER: Yeah, if a big bull

442
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,147
croc slithers up on the raft,

443
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,515
I'm gonna pour a ring of gas

444
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,550
around me and set it on fire.

445
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,551
>> CYRIL: Why...?

446
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,818
>> ARCHER: Cyril, they can't

447
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,153
chomp through fire.

448
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:39,521
Although, I have no reason to

449
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:40,556
think that.

450
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,557
>> CYRIL: Why are you so scared

451
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,824
of crocodiles?

452
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:44,159
>> ARCHER: Gee, I don't know,

453
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,527
Cyril.

454
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,562
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of

455
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,563
any apex predator that lived

456
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,830
through the K-T extinction.

457
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,165
>> CYRIL: The...?

458
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,533
>> ARCHER: Physically unchanged

459
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:52,568
for 100 million years, because

460
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,569
it's the perfect killing

461
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,836
machine-- a half-ton of

462
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,005
cold-blooded fury, with a bite

463
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,840
force of 20,000 Newtons, and

464
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,576
stomach acid so strong, it can

465
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,577
dissolve bones and hooves.

466
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,844
And now we're surrounded, those

467
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:04,179
snake-eyes are watching from the

468
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,582
shadows, waiting for the night.

469
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:07,583
>> RAY: ¶ Waiting

470
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:08,850
For the night! ¶

471
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,185
>> ARCHER: Damn it, Ray!

472
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,553
>> RAY: ¶ Ooh-hoo!

473
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:12,588
>> ARCHER: Keep your voice down!

474
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,589
>> RAY: Why?!

475
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,856
Crocodiles don't have ears!

476
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:15,857
>> ARCHER: They absolutely have

477
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,192
ears, shit head!

478
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,193
>> RAY: Well, so do I, and

479
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,194
you just talked yourself out of

480
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,796
a hat!

481
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:21,797
(all yelling)

482
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,065
>> CYRIL: Jeezy Pete's!

483
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,399
>> ARCHER: Way to go, Ray.

484
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,701
Now he's got a taste for...

485
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:26,802
(yelling)

486
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:27,803
>> RAY: Oh, my God!

487
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,071
>> CYRIL: Shoot it! Shoot it!

488
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:30,405
Shoot it!

489
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,707
>> ARCHER: Uh, I can't!

490
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,608
>> RAY: Sweet Jesus God,

491
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,609
then at least shoot out my eyes

492
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,876
so I don't have to see!

493
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,211
(yelling)

494
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,213
Oh, my God!

495
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:39,581
>> CYRIL: What is happening?

496
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,816
(yelling)

497
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:41,883
Oh, God!

498
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:42,884
>> RAY: Oh, boy.

499
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,152
(groaning and crying)

500
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:45,454
No.

501
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,822
(Archer groans)

502
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:50,425
(Gillette and Cyril crying)

503
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,727
(growling)

504
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:52,828
>> ARCHER: Huh.

505
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,829
(Cyril and Gillette whimpering)

506
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,830
I thought that was gonna be way

507
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:55,831
more... epic-fireball-y.

508
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,099
(Gillette whimpers)

509
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,100
>> CYRIL: Wuh-wuh, wuh-wuh,

510
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,434
wuh-wuh...

511
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:00,435
>> ARCHER: Come on, Cyril.

512
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:01,737
Pick one.

513
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:02,738
Either have a stroke, or spit it

514
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,839
out.

515
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:04,673
>> CYRIL: W-w-were you g-g-gonna

516
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:05,974
say, "A taste for human flesh?"

517
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,309
>> ARCHER: No, I was gonna say,

518
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,644
"Hat," but now it's not funny.

519
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,678
Well, not as funny.

520
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,679
>> RAY: It's all your

521
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:11,980
fault.

522
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,315
It's all your fault.

523
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,650
>> ARCHER: Which part, Ray?!

524
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,684
The part where I flipped our

525
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,685
jeep down a cliff about 90

526
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,654
goddamn times, because I got

527
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,622
drunk to cope with the fact I

528
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,657
was about to murder us in the

529
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:22,924
jungle?!

530
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:23,925
>> RAY: Well, it-it... it's

531
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,627
your fault we're in this stupid

532
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,662
jungle in the first place!

533
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:27,663
>> ARCHER: Well, if we're gonna

534
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,930
go back to the beginning of

535
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,866
time, Mother's the one who got

536
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,334
us arrested for treason, and

537
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,769
then bought a ton of goddamn

538
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,870
cocaine!

539
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:35,871
>> CYRIL: I thought you b-bought

540
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,139
it.

541
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:38,473
>> LANA: Wait. What?

542
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,775
>> MALORY: Up! Up!

543
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:40,876
Hands off the goods, mister!

544
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:41,877
>> PAM: Aw.

545
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,878
>> MALORY: I said that's

546
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,146
ridiculous.

547
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,480
Where would I get 2,000 pounds

548
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:46,782
of cocaine?

549
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:47,883
>> LANA: But if you didn't...

550
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:48,884
Okay, so, where would Archer get

551
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:49,885
that much coke?

552
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:51,153
>> MALORY: Well, who knows with

553
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,487
him?

554
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:53,488
Maybe wherever he got that new

555
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,489
kind of VD none of the doctors

556
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,791
had ever seen before.

557
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:56,792
>> LANA: Wha?! When was that?!

558
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:57,793
>> PAM: Yeah, when was that?

559
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,894
>> CHERLENE: Seriously, was...

560
00:12:58,896 --> 00:12:59,895
>> MALORY: Trust me, if you had

561
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,163
it, you'd know.

562
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,497
>> CHERLENE & PAM: Phew!

563
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:03,498
>> LANA: Ugh. I loathe knowing

564
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,499
that I had sex with the same

565
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,801
person as you two.

566
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,802
>> PAM: What? You had sex with

567
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:07,903
me!

568
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:08,904
>> LANA: No, I... (gasps)

569
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:09,905
Oh, my God, that's right.

570
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,173
>> MALORY: Ha!

571
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,174
>> PAM: What are you laughing

572
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,508
at?

573
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,543
>> MALORY: Oh, my God, that's

574
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,911
right.

575
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:16,912
>> ARCHER: So if you dicks want

576
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:17,979
to blame somebody for our

577
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:18,980
current predicament, blame...

578
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:19,981
>> RAY: You! I blame you!

579
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,752
Archer! I blame you!

580
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,721
 <i>J'accuse!</i>

581
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:26,722
(flames whoosh, all yelling)

582
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,525
>> ARCHER: What was that, Ray?!

583
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:33,328
(whistling)

584
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,696
(laughs): Sorry.

585
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:38,066
I genuinely couldn't hear you.

586
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,872
(Cyril and Gillette crying)

587
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:44,940
>> ARCHER: Jesus, what is wrong

588
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,208
with you two?

589
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,275
>> CYRIL: What's wrong?!

590
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:48,410
What's wrong is we're about to

591
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,778
be on fire!

592
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,846
>> RAY: Do something!

593
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:51,847
>> ARCHER: Uh, no?

594
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:52,848
>> RAY: Archer!

595
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,849
>> ARCHER: Not until you

596
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:54,850
apologize.

597
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:55,851
>> RAY: For what?!

598
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:56,852
>> CYRIL: Ray, goddamn it, just

599
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:57,853
apologize!

600
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,221
>> RAY: I... Jesus Christ,

601
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,222
I'm sorry!

602
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,223
>> ARCHER: There, was that so

603
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,224
hard?

604
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:03,525
Okay!

605
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:04,893
(Gillette coughing, sputtering)

606
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:05,894
>> CYRIL: What the hell are

607
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:06,895
you... (coughing)

608
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,096
>> ARCHER: Crocodile repellent!

609
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,297
>> CYRIL (coughing): What?!

610
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,298
>> ARCHER: We got to swim for

611
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,800
it-- on three.

612
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,568
>> CYRIL: No, no, n... (grunts)

613
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,569
Archer!

614
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,570
>> ARCHER: Sorry, three!

615
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:16,805
Kick, Cyril, kick!

616
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:17,806
(Cyril coughing)

617
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,441
(Gillette retching, coughing)

618
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,809
It's okay, stupid, I forgive

619
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:21,810
you.

620
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:22,811
>> RAY: F...

621
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,546
>> ARCHER: Forgive, yes.

622
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:26,748
Cannonball!

623
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,850
Woooooo!!

624
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,054
(Cyril retching)

625
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,756
(Gillette moaning)

626
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:35,791
>> ARCHER (chuckling): Oh...

627
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,825
>> CYRIL: Oh, God, I think I

628
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:37,826
swallowed a leech.

629
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:38,827
>> ARCHER: Well, the gas ought

630
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,828
to kill that.

631
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,829
>> RAY: (coughs) You

632
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,230
asshole, you could've killed us!

633
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:43,231
(Cyril clears throat)

634
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,232
Well?!

635
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,333
>> CYRIL: Well, you did set the

636
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,334
raft on fire.

637
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,335
>> RAY: Oh, my God, you

638
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,137
always take his side!

639
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,072
>> CYRIL: I never, ever, ever

640
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:52,774
take his side.

641
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:53,909
>> ARCHER: Blah, blah, blah,

642
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:54,943
some joke about you two having

643
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,278
vaginas.

644
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,412
Come on, let's go.

645
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,413
>> CYRIL: Go where?

646
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,648
>> ARCHER: Well, long-term, I

647
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,649
was thinking home.

648
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,083
Short-term, I... Here, hold

649
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,084
this.

650
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:04,085
(grunts)

651
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,086
>> RAY: Go herd.

652
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,488
>> ARCHER: Short-term, somewhere

653
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,923
that's not the crocodile version

654
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:08,824
of a drive-through.

655
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,825
(crocodile snarls)

656
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,826
>> CYRIL: Sounds good!

657
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:11,827
Here we go!

658
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:12,828
>> ARCHER: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

659
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,829
>> CYRIL: I got it. (grunting)

660
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,163
>> ARCHER: Cyril.

661
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,965
>> CYRIL: What if I need a gun?

662
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,633
>> ARCHER: Um...

663
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:19,634
here.

664
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:20,635
>> CYRIL: Oh, come on.

665
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,803
>> ARCHER: The only limit is

666
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,605
your imagination.

667
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,842
Pyoo! Pyoo!

668
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,811
(Cyril sighs)

669
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:30,879
>> PAM: Aw, look, she's almost

670
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,614
not terrifying.

671
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,615
>> LANA: (sighs) Thanks, you

672
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:34,616
guys.

673
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:35,617
I think the spa day took her

674
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:36,985
mind off Archer being missing,

675
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,954
even if it almost got weird.

676
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,055
>> CHERLENE: She made it weird.

677
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,122
>> LANA: No, you did.

678
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,290
Nobody wants an enema.

679
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,291
>> CHERLENE: Some people...

680
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,292
>> LANA: Not with yogurt.

681
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,827
>> PAM: So... you think those

682
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,028
guys are okay?

683
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,063
>> LANA: I don't know.

684
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,130
I mean, if it were anybody else,

685
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,665
I'd say no, but this is Archer

686
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,068
we're talking about so...

687
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,035
probably not.

688
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,036
>> CYRIL: Oh, for... Can you not

689
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,671
give it a rest?

690
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:57,706
>> RAY: Not until he admits

691
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,707
he's been half-assing this

692
00:15:58,709 --> 00:15:59,708
entire cocaine debacle from

693
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,709
the get-go.

694
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,710
>> ARCHER: That's only because I

695
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,711
thought it was gonna be way

696
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,712
easier.

697
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,713
>> RAY: You think

698
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,081
everything's gonna be easy!

699
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,716
>> ARCHER: It almost always is!

700
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,884
>> RAY: Aha! See?

701
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:09,885
That's what I resent.

702
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:10,886
>> ARCHER: What do you resent,

703
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,220
Ray, my muscly shoulders poking

704
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,855
into your tum-tum?

705
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:14,923
>> RAY: I resent how you

706
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:15,891
never take anything seriously

707
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:16,892
because you just assume

708
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:17,893
everything's gonna work out for

709
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:18,894
you.

710
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:19,895
>> ARCHER: It almost always

711
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:20,896
does!

712
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:21,897
(Cyril sighs)

713
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,898
Case in point.

714
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,499
>> CYRIL: What the...

715
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,901
>> RAY: Goddamn it.

716
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:26,902
>> CYRIL (quietly): Hey, do you

717
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,936
think those guys are Doctors

718
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,104
Without Borders?

719
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,705
>> ARCHER: Yes, Cyril, I do.

720
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:32,040
I bet those assault rifles shoot

721
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,241
polio vaccine.

722
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,943
They're narcos, dummy.

723
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,077
And that plane's probably loaded

724
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,078
with coke.

725
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,079
Okay, here's the plan...

726
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,080
>> CYRIL: What? Are you crazy?

727
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,081
>> RAY: You're out of your

728
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,082
mind.

729
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,083
>> ARCHER: We have to get out of

730
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,184
the country, so we can either

731
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:45,387
walk out-- which, no, no, we

732
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,122
can't-- or we can fly out in an

733
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:49,257
airplane full of cocaine.

734
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,525
>> CYRIL: Ray is paralyzed.

735
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:51,593
Who's gonna fly it?

736
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,594
>> ARCHER: Don't... That...

737
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,595
Why would you worry about that

738
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:54,596
before you need to?

739
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,597
>> CYRIL: What?

740
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,598
>> ARCHER: Why clog your brain

741
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,732
with a bunch of hypothetical

742
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:58,967
maybe-what-if bullshit?

743
00:16:58,969 --> 00:16:59,968
>> CYRIL: Because...

744
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,969
>> ARCHER: Shut up.

745
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:01,970
This is what we're doing.

746
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,905
So, Cyril, lock and load that

747
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:06,141
stick.

748
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,843
(indistinct chatter)

749
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,948
(Gillette stifles a sneeze)

750
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,089
>> ARCHER (quietly): <i>Manos</i>

751
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,290
 <i>arriba.</i>

752
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,725
>> GILLETTE (whispering): Nice.

753
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,060
>> ARCHER: You want to...

754
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:26,995
>> RAY: Oh, right.

755
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,764
(cocks gun)

756
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,166
>> BOSS NARCO: <i>Bueno pues,</i>

757
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,133
 <i>cuando está cargado...</i>

758
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,235
>> RAY: <i>Manos...</i>

759
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,403
Um...

760
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,404
Wait, what was it?

761
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,173
>> ARCHER: <i>Arriba!</i> Goddamn it.

762
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,307
 <i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

763
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,408
(weapons cocking)

764
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,409
>> BOSS NARCO: (chuckles) I

765
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:42,410
don't think so, gringo.

766
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:43,445
>> ARCHER: Drop your weapons!

767
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:44,446
I'm serious.

768
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,447
I will shoot this guy right in

769
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,982
the...

770
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,450
>> BOSS NARCO: (laughs) What the

771
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:51,653
hell is that?

772
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,822
>> ARCHER: Pyoo! Pyoo!

773
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,323
(narcos laughing)

774
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,760

775
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,096
(narcos shouting)

776
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,332
>> ARCHER: Okay, okay!

777
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,333
(moans)

778
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,168
Goddamn it, Cyril!

779
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,803
>> CYRIL: Woooooo!! (chuckles)

780
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:09,804
Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez!

781
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:10,805
Sorry.

782
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:11,806
>> ARCHER: That's why I wanted

783
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:12,807
you to be stick.

784
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,009
>> RAY: Uh-uh!

785
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,111
>> ARCHER: Yeah, come on.

786
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:17,212
It's been a long day.

787
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:18,013

788
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,848
idea who we are?

789
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,683
>> ARCHER: Mmm... nope.

790
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,151
Do you know who we are?

791
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,053

793
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,223
>> ARCHER: Then blow me.

794
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,457
Cyril, make sure it's good and

795
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,159
tight.

796
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,293
(Archer chuckles)

797
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:33,361
Why are we not still doing

798
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,362
phrasing?

799
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,363
>> CYRIL: Why are we still not

800
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,364
worrying about who's gonna fly

801
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,499
the damn plane?!

802
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,633

00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,235

>> CYRIL: Oh, you are kidding.

808
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,575
>> ARCHER: Okay, Ray, ballpark,

809
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:48,877
how long will it take you to

810
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,045
teach me how to fly a plane?

811
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,046
>> RAY: What... How long?

812
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,047
>> CYRIL: I flew the space

813
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,048
shuttle.

814
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,049
>> ARCHER: Cyril, hush.

815
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,083
Big guys.

816
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,084
Ray, how long...

817
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,085
>> RAY: How long will it take

818
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:58,653
you, Archer, to admit you dick

819
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,221
around every time we're in

820
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,890
danger just to screw with

821
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,491
everybody because of your

822
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,193
complete... no, your utter

823
00:19:05,195 --> 00:19:08,096
contempt for your own mortality?

824
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:10,732
>> ARCHER: I mean...

825
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,200
Yeah, duh.

826
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,269
>> RAY: That's all I wanted.

827
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,470
(grunts)

828
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,406
>> CYRIL: (gasps) What?

829
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,108
You could walk this whole time?!

830
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,410
(Archer laughs)

831
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,112
>> ARCHER: No, Cyril, of course

832
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,113
I'm not mad.

833
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:27,282
I think what Ray did was

834
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:28,283
awesome.

835
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,350
>> CYRIL: Okay, well, then you

836
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:30,518
are an idiot.

837
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,519
>> ARCHER: Your words.

838
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,520
>> CYRIL: Which, I guess,

839
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:33,888
so am I, since I just realized

840
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,056
we can't land anywhere with

841
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:36,057
all this cocaine onboard.

842
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,125
Oh, my God, you guys, where are

843
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,126
we gonna land?!

844
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,127
>> RAY: Jesus Christ, woman,

845
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,228
calm down.

846
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,296
