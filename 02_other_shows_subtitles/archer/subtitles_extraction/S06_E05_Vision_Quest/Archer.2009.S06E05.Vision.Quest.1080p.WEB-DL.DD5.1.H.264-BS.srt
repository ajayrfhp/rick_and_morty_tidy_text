1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,370
Jeez, larue,
can you believe this?

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:07,339
A mandatory meeting
at 7:00 a.M.?

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,308
Wonder what
crawled up her butt.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,777
Ugh, there's no telling.
Our bodies are aswarm

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,812
With microscopic organisms,
pam.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,514
Literally aswarm.

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,216
Wait. What?
What have you heard?

8
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,319
About the staff meeting?
Oh, right. Yes.
Never mind.

9
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,054
Then may I suggest
we get up there,

10
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,357
So we don't have to find out
what "grave consequences" means.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,861
[scoffs]
it means--
in the context of her memo.

12
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,063
Jesus, what's up his butt?

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,664
I think
the important thing now

14
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,834
Is that we don't start
any sort of panic.

15
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,669
Hurry up, ya ding-dongs!

16
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,805
Wait, wait, wait!
I'm coming!
Hurry up.

17
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,508
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, keep your panties on.

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,712
One step ahead of you.
Or am I?

19
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,747
Wait. Is archer
blowing this off?

20
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,516
No. Hold the door.
Hold the door!
[bell dings]

21
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,351
I am.
It's not doing anything.

22
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,186
Damn it, ray,
hold the frickin' door!

23
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,488
Oh, no!
It's <i>maximum overdrive</i>
<i>all over--</i>

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,757
[grunting]

25
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,162
[breathing heavily]
oh, good. You made it.

26
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,397
Look, ray,
one is red and one is green.

27
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,932
What are you, color blind?

28
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,235
I am, actually.
<i>â™ª [easy listening]</i>

29
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,838
Typical.
Of what?

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,408
So, does anybody
have any idea what
this meeting is about?

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,510
Well, if I know
ms. Archer, it's--
butt bugs.

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,112
[laughing]
what?
Not what I was--

33
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,214
Ugh! That was
a figure of speech.

34
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,683
They all are!
Hey, will you quit yelling?

35
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,085
Will you?
Yes!

36
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,554
Hey!
Remain calm. Do not panic.

37
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,122
No one's panicking, krieger.

38
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,890
Only because they
haven't hatched yet.

39
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,093
Who?
What hasn't hatched?

40
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,761
What?
Quit yelling!

41
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,896
Krieger, what hasn't hatched?
I've said too much.

42
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,865
Krieger, I swear to--
[thudding]

43
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,902
[all gasp, mutter]
[creaking]

44
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,137
[all gasp]
oh, my god.

45
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,439
Remain calm.
Do not panic.

46
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,208
Krieger, shut up.
See? It's broken.

47
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,409
Ray?
Archer?

48
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,477
Hang on.

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,078
Ray, cyril,
give me a hand here.

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,747
[all straining]

51
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,149
Lana...
What?

52
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,151
You--
should be doing this.

53
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,854
You know...
[all grunting]

54
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,791
[gasping]
oh, my god!
We work in a coal mine?

55
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,392
Carol, shut up.

56
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,394
You're not
my coal mine supervisor!

57
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,331
Yeah. Hey, guys?

58
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,566
[men grunting, straining]

59
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,903
Oh, damn it.

60
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,505
What?
What is it?

61
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,740
Well, thanks to ray,
who let's just all assume

62
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,576
Broke the elevator somehow,
we're stuck at the top.

63
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,346
[creaking]
[all gasp, mutter]

64
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,582
I hope.

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,324
Hello!
Hello!

66
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,727
Hello!
Hello!

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,163
Stop it.
No one else can hear you,

68
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,965
Because no one else
is here yet.

69
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,568
[beeping]
not that other people
actually work here.

70
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,036
What do you mean?
Where'd they go?

71
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,637
Remember when
the office shut down,

72
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,906
And we spent an entire year
as coke dealers?

73
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,576
What, so people just quit?
And on the subject of things

74
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,644
That don't work here anymore,

75
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,413
My phone.
Uh, got nothing.

76
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:38,483
I am sans bars.
Yeah, you're not
gonna get a signal.

77
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,385
I installed an r.F. Jammer
on the roof.

78
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,355
Of the building?
No, of the elevator.

79
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,690
Why?
You did what?

80
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,657
[clears throat]

81
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,860
And for what
possible reason?

82
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:52,164
So people would quit
staring at their phones
and talk to each other.

83
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,366
Okay, well,
then let's open the--

84
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,101
One, two, three, go!
Trap door!

85
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,869
Ray, open the trap door.

86
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,271
He can't.
Wha--

87
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,872
Oh, my god!
Cyril, please.

88
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,542
I am way stronger than you.

89
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,044
[straining]
that being said,
this thing's stuck.

90
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,680
It's not stuck,
it's locked from the outside.

91
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:12,017
Wait. What?
It's not for stranded
passengers to get out,

92
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,885
It's for rescue crews
to get in.

93
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,088
The last thing they want
is people crawling around

94
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,357
On top of a malfunctioning
elevator car.

95
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,959
Who is "they"?
Big elevator.

96
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,427
Not a thing.

97
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,529
And why do you know
so much about elevators?

98
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,298
I don't know.
It's a hobby.

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,601
I guess I've just always
been fascinated by them.

100
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,070
I honestly have
no response to that.

101
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,739
Anyway, I bet the top
of the car smashed

102
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,307
Right into the motor, so--

103
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,976
Yeesh. Hope
the radio jammer's okay.

104
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,978
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow!

105
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,081
Thanks, krieger.
I think we all needed that.

106
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,218
And besides,
we don't need cell phones.
We have a--

107
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,086
Elevator phone!
Cyril, try that.

108
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,322
I am, if you'd shut up.

109
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,591
Oh, gross!
This phone is all sticky.

110
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,826
Yeah, mine at home
gets bad sticky.

111
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,395
Ew.
Of course it does.

112
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,131
And since when are you
elevator boss?
Birth?

113
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,666
And...

114
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,001
It's dead.
Typical.

115
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,971
Okay, ray. Interface.

116
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,106
I'm sorry?
With the controls.

117
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,475
Beep, boop, boop, boop!
Come on, cyborg.

118
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,111
R2-d2 it.
"r2-d2 it."

119
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,414
Yeah, probe around
in there and whatever.

120
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,982
Shut down the tractor beam.

121
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,750
With what, my dick?

122
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,086
I-- however you
normally do it.

123
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,587
I don't normally do it!

124
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,323
I know, but this
is an emergency.

125
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,991
Hey! Hey!

126
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,459
Damn it, carol.
There's nobody--

127
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,428
Shut up, stupid.
It's milton!

128
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,964
[squeaks]
go get help, boy.

129
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,201
[beeping]
there's no time!
Go get help!

130
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,602
[beeps]

131
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,374
Get help how?
It's a toaster.

132
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,944
Well! Well, at the very least,
maybe he'll bring back toast.

133
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,979
And speaking of toast,
I don't know about you guys,

134
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,549
But I didn't eat any...
[chomping loudly]

135
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,651
Breakfast.
Hey, hey, wait a second.

136
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,653
Get your own
goddamn bear claw!

137
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,655
Cyril, what is that?
Is that a bagel?

138
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,724
No. Get off.
Jeez, it's just napkins.

139
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,126
Guys, get the napkins!
Okay, let's just
take it down a n--

140
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,861
Shut up!
We're all gonna starve!

141
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,529
Give me...
Get away!

142
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,998
Guys, come on.
Knock it off, please.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,167
Easy! Hey! Hey!
Pam, stop that.

144
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,569
Everybody calm--

145
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,771
[loud ringing in ears]
[muted chatter]

146
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,844
[distorted,
unintelligible chatter]

147
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,546
Asshole!
What the hell?

148
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,849
I'm sorry.
Seriously, I'm sorry.

149
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,318
I sincerely apologize
for doing that.

150
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,719
Archer,
if you do that again--

151
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,721
I swear to god
I won't do it again.

152
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,323
Please don't.
You're listening for once.

153
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,258
That being said,

154
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,727
I swear to god
I will do it again.

155
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,098
Asshole.
Ray, shut up.

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,267
Cyril, let's get that
sweater vest off, buddy.

157
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,404
I'm sorry?
I know, but nobody
makes you wear them.

158
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,205
I-- why do you want it?

159
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,174
As, like, a tablecloth
or whatever.

160
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,176
We're all gonna put our food
and drink in the middle,

161
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,345
And then I'll be in charge
of rationing it out.

162
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,280
No.
Why do you think
you would be in charge?

163
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,115
Because I've been
lost at sea.

164
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,950
[laughs]
what?

165
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,754
I was lost at sea, lana,
and we had to ration
the food and water.

166
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,023
Well, we should have.
I actually ate it all

167
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,625
While the other guy
was asleep.

168
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,226
Why would you tell us
that story?

169
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,928
If anything,
that proves my point.

170
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,930
People like me
are exactly why

171
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,865
We have to ration
our food and water.

172
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,434
People like you, who?

173
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,270
The strong,
like me and you and pam,

174
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,605
Who will naturally
prey on the weak,

175
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,474
Like the rest of them.

176
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,477
[sighs]
maybe we should
pool it together.

177
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,379
We don't know how long
we're gonna be in here.

178
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah, give it up, weakie.

179
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,415
Pam, shut up.
I'll start.

180
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,318
Here's...Maybe
six ounces of bourbon.

181
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,654
[grunting]
if cyril would
hurry it up already!

182
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,289
For the love of god,
will you just--

183
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,590
Okay. Wait a minute.

184
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,625
How exactly is this
supposed to work?

185
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,327
It puts the vest
on the floor!

186
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,129
We put food and drink
on the vest!

187
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,497
Yeah, but where
on the floor?

188
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,666
There's no room.
It'll get kicked over.

189
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,469
Okay, so we tie the vest into,
like, a pouch, and--

190
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,571
For god's sake, man,
it has no sleeves.

191
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,506
Plus the food'll just
fall out the neckhole.

192
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,241
[sighs]
well, then it's official.

193
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,677
The sweater vest
is literally good for nothing.

194
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,813
Hey, you know what?
Besides how to dress
like an adult?

195
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,816
Well, that's the only thing
you do like an adult.

196
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,017
[snaps fingers]
burn!

197
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,786
Yeah. Total burn.

198
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,654
I hope I don't
start crying later

199
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,791
When I'm driving an automobile
to or from a bar!

200
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,826
After having sex
with a prostitute.

201
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,363
Which is the most adult thing
a person could possibly do!

202
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,266
I like him in vests.
Me too.

203
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,667
Yeah. It works for him.

204
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,503
Well, thanks, ladies.

205
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,671
That's--
no. No. Shut up.

206
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,640
I need to think.
About what?

207
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,342
Look, this isn't
that hard, people.

208
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,811
We've got a bagel,
four coffees,
a quart of beer--

209
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,279
[chuckling]
a quart?

210
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,348
This a fawty, shawty!
Thanks, omar.

211
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,518
And on top of that,
we've got, I'm guessing,
two flasks of bourbon.

212
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,786
I didn't know if I'd
have time for lunch.

213
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,655
And, krieger? Coffee?

214
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,457
Uh, no.

215
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,125
Tea?
No.

216
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,461
What is it, soup?

217
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,896
Define "soup."

218
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,564
[scoffs]
oh, good lord!

219
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,466
Would it be safe
to say nobody here

220
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,901
Wants to eat
what's in your thermos?

221
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,403
[gasps]
sweet jesus god,
I would hope so!

222
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,406
Okay, so how about
we all agree to hold on

223
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,875
To our food and drinks for now,
if for no other reason than--

224
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,143
[gulping]

225
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,177
Pam!
Pam!

226
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,147
Come on!
Pam, stop it!

227
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,549
[belches]

228
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,018
Oh, god!
That wasn't just bear claw.

229
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,386
What did you eat
for breakfast?

230
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,520
[belches]

231
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,155
Linguine and clam sauce.

232
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,492
Oh, god!
What, did you wake up
on the docks?

233
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,595
[belches]
but I don't know
about those clams, though.

234
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,197
As I was saying,
before you, pam,

235
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,667
Drank a third of a gallon
of malt liquor,

236
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,903
Maybe we shouldn't eat
or drink too much, because--

237
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,705
Yes, pam?
I have to pee.

238
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,107
Come on!
Of course you do.
You just drank a 40!

239
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,509
That's what
I was trying to say.

240
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,044
I'm not a frickin'
mind reader.

241
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,579
Yeah. In her defense,
you didn't finish.

242
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,880
Yeah.
Pam, shut up.

243
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,615
[gasps]
I have an idea!

244
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,017
Okay. Wait.
Does it have anything to do

245
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,286
With our current situation?

246
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,354
Yes.

247
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,956
Okay, what is it?

248
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,857
We are stuck
in an elevator.

249
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,794
The idea,
not our current situation.

250
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,862
Well, I'm not
a frickin' mind reader!

251
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,131
[gasps]
oh, my god,
what if I am?

252
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,768
Then I guess you'd know
what we're all thinking
right this very minute.

253
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,372
Okay. You want a drink,
you want to lecture us,

254
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,308
You want more bear claws,
you want to smoke,
you want to masturbate,

255
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,311
And you're scared that
we'll figure out you're actually
just a krieger clone.

256
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,615
What? That's--
that's all just common sense.

257
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,050
How is it common sense
that she thinks I want
to masturbate?

258
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,052
Come on, cyril.
For most of us,

259
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,121
She just rattled off
our obvious addictions.

260
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm not addicted
to lecturing people.

261
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,659
[laughter]

262
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,397
Oh, come on.
That's... All right.

263
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
And what are you
laughing at, stroker ace?

264
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,401
I'm not addicted
to masturbating!

265
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,770
Cyril, come on.
Hand on the bible,

266
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,472
Lie detector,
gun to your head,

267
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,108
You don't want
to masturbate right now?

268
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,977
Well, not in this elevator.

269
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,746
Well, I want to drink, so...

270
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,681
And I want to smoke, so...

271
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,583
So cyril ought
to be able to jack it.

272
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,351
Pam, shut up.
Well, we tried.

273
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,187
And just where, exactly,
were you hoping
to smoke that cigarette?

274
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,822
Magnum p.I.'s house.

275
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,924
But since I'm stuck in here
with you people...

276
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,861
Hey! What the shit, woman?

277
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,663
The shit is that
I am breastfeeding,

278
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,865
So you will not smoke
in this elevator!

279
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,600
You want to bet?
Do you?

280
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,702
[grunting]
they're both addicted
to gambling.

281
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,171
And you're just
a regular sylvia browne.
[thudding]

282
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,373
I also have
extreme claustrophobia.

283
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,776
Psst, cyril.
Try to rub one out.

284
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,478
I do not want
to masturbate!

285
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,114
Oh, for--
not even watching that?

286
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,184
[archer]
hey! Guys, come on! Hey!
Get your hands o--

287
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,620
[clicks]
aah.

288
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,289
I'm serious.
I cannot stress this enough.

289
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,625
You do not want tinnitus.

290
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,859
How about cirrhosis?

291
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,662
Probably not that either.

292
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,664
Now, then.
Carol, you had an idea?

293
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,033
[gasps]
are you a mind reader, too?

294
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,369
No. You told us
that you had one.

295
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,538
What? Oh, right. Yes.

296
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,673
We all jump up and down
at the same time

297
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,675
To unjam this stupid thing,

298
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,711
And then it plummets
down into the basement,

299
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,013
And we boing into
that giant spring

300
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,648
At the bottom of
the elevator shaft,

301
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,250
And then are safe.

302
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,155
So, suicide pact.
An oldie but a goodie.

303
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,757
Should we vote?
Who's in?

304
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,358
Uh-uh. No.
No. Not doing that.

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,894
No. That works.
I've heard about
people doing that.

306
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,097
You just want an excuse
to wet your pants.

307
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,865
I don't need an excuse.

308
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,767
Yeah, what is this,
soviet russia?

309
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,436
It-- wait.
Are you seriously asking?

310
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,338
[scoffs]
I mean...

311
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,407
Krieger, what's the deal?
Would that really work?

312
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,744
Wha-- you're asking
the guy with a thermos
full of human being soup?

313
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,946
It's--
that's not even-- if--

314
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,681
What is this,
soviet russia?

315
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,949
Right?
Oh, my god.

316
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,717
Cyril, shut up.
You shut up!

317
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,519
Krieger, would that work?

318
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,621
Huh. Maybe?

319
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,890
Maybe?
What do you mean, maybe?

320
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,292
Look, first of all,
there's no giant spring
at the bottom.

321
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,394
It's a hydraulic buffer,
but you don't want
to be in the elevator

322
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,963
When it slams into it.

323
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,699
No, but at the last second,
you just jump up in the air.

324
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,100
How would you know
when to jump?

325
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,735
Because you'd give me
a lecture on it.

326
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,804
Burn!

327
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,572
Ray!
She burned her.

328
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,875
I know, but--
no. Shut up,
because here's the thing--

329
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,376
Safety brakes.

330
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,145
That's actually what
elisha otis invented.

331
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,379
Not the elevator itself,

332
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,281
But the safety brakes
to stop it.

333
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,450
It was too bad
they couldn't stop diphtheria.

334
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,885
So wait.
Would the brakes stop us?

335
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,286
Maybe?

336
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,488
Ugh!
Oh, my god!
Come on!

337
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,490
Look, I don't know
if they were damaged
in the crash.

338
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,592
Okay, but what's
the worst case?

339
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,629
Worst case is we die.

Two things.

One, I really think we need
to have a serious talk

back in the mix.
