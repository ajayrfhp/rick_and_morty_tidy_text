1
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:05,292
LANA: What do you
think you're doing?

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:06,827
ARCHER: My job, Lana.

3
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:10,864
LANA: And what part of your job,
exactly, is groping my ass?

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,700
ARCHER: The part that
calls for spycraft.

5
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,802
C'mon, we're posing as newlyweds--
LANA: Yeah, posing.

6
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,705
ARCHER: -- and I am
drunk on nuptial bliss.

7
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,139
LANA: You're drunk
on champagne.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,041
ARCHER: Little column
A, little column B.

9
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,042
LANA: Mrvit!

10
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:26,661
ARCHER: Fine, but when you take my hand off
your lately almost overly ample butt --

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,655
LANA: Odd choice
of dying words...

12
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:29,557
ARCHER: I don't just question

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,195
your commitment to the mission, Lana, I
question your commitment to America.

14
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:36,499
LANA: Instead of feeling me up in the lobby --
ARCHER: Wait til we're in the

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:36,900
room, got it.

16
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,802
LANA: -- what say we
focus on the mission:

17
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:41,905
catching the North Koreans who are
in New York to buy enriched uranium.

18
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,139
ARCHER: Can't we do both?

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,140
LANA: Can't you shut up?

20
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,975
ARCHER: Can't you put a
price tag on freedom?

21
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:48,845
I mean you can't put a
price tag on freedom.

22
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,513
Always never forget that.

23
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:53,249
DESK CLERK: Here's your key for the
honeymoon suite, congratties, and if I

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,253
could just get a credit card for the
room and any incidentals, we'll be --

25
00:00:57,254 --> 00:00:59,388
LANA: Broke, Jesus, the
room's that much?!

26
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:00,990
DESK CLERK: Is there a problem?

27
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,059
LANA: Not if we're
buying it as a condo.

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,063
DESK CLERK: I may have something a bit
more in your price range... basement okay?

29
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:11,133
ARCHER: No it's not, because as
love-besotted newlyweds we want the

30
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,435
honeymoon suite.

31
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:14,771
And price range is...rangeless.

32
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:16,005
LANA: Archer...?!

33
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:19,241
ARCHER: Shhh, a few minutes more, darling,
and you can have your way with me.

34
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,678
LANA: Ugh, I wish...
ARCHER: I know. Soon.

35
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:23,546
DESK CLERK: Alrighty, and
we are just all set.

36
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:24,714
Enjoy your stay.

37
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,549
ARCHER: Enjoy your stay...?

38
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,448
DESK CLERK: Oh, right, sorry!
Enjoy your stay --

39
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,486
LANA: No no no -

40
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:30,720
DESK CLERK: Mr. and Mrs. Archer!

41
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,990
LANA: Ughhh, it's like my heart's
being gripped by the icy fingers of

42
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,726
some terrifying Ghost
of Honeymoon Future.

43
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:37,694
ARCHER: (chuckles)

44
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:38,928
Lana.

45
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:41,297
Lana!

46
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:44,100
Lana!!

47
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,436
C'mon, if you don't answer I'm gonna
scream as loud as I possibly --

48
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:48,237
LANA: What?!

49
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,707
ARCHER: I'm sorry, I meant "Mrs.
Archer."

50
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,543
LANA: mmmm MALORY: I heard you.

51
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:56,546
WAITER: I apologize, madame, but --
MALORY: For what, Dunkirk? Or

52
00:01:56,547 --> 00:02:01,618
that effeminate yet somehow
condescending tone?

53
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,320
Damn, I'm sure my card was in here...
TRUDY BEEKMAN (O.S.): Malory,

54
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,889
please, allow me...

55
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,890
MALORY: No no no, I'm --

56
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,890
TRUDY BEEKMAN: Embarrassing
yourself, dear.

57
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:12,461
MALORY: Thank you, Trudy.

58
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:15,965
PAM: Oh man, this
must be killing you!

59
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,167
CYRIL: What, the salmonella
dripping all over my desk?

60
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,737
PAM: It's lamb,
ding-dong, not salmon.

61
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,639
CYRIL: I --
PAM: I'm talking about Mr. Archer and Lana!

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,274
In a deluxe honeymoon suite!

63
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,276
CYRIL: Oh for -- Pam,
they're on a mission!

64
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:32,248
PAM: Ary position! By now, since I bet
they already did all the good ones...

65
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:42,805
CYRIL: Rrgh! Pam, they're --
PAM: Ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh

66
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:58,556
ungh ungh ungh ungh ungh
ungh. Want some?

67
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,443
CYRIL: I --
PAM: Psych!

68
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:11,600
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>

69
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:40,012
CYRIL: Okay, first of
all, just shut up.

70
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,765
And second, I trust
Lana completely.

71
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,215
Especially with
regard to Archer.

72
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,217
She'd rather have sex with...
you.

73
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,252
PAM: Why, what'd she say?!

74
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:50,356
CYRIL: And third, Lana's pretty satisfied
in the old romance department.

75
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:54,494
PAM: And the old accounting department...
CYRIL: What's that?

76
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,697
LANA (O.S.): [sex noises]

77
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:01,267
CYRIL (O.S.): [sex noises]

78
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,001
PAM: What's that?

79
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,269
CYRIL: Well good thing you
work at a spy agency!

80
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,572
Miss... Spy On People!

81
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,373
PAM: What, I only
watched for a second!

82
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,442
CYRIL: You need medication, Pam!
Pills!

83
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,210
Big pills, like they
use at the zoo!

84
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,780
CHERYL/CAROL: But we have to go now, the
vet comes back from lunch in twenty

85
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,582
minutes!

86
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,917
CHERYL/CAROL: Let's go, bitches!
Tiger tranqs!

87
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,118
CYRIL: We are not.
Breaking into the zoo.

88
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,753
To steal tiger tranquilizers.

89
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,889
CHERYL/CAROL: Cyril,
they have all kinds.

90
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,525
CYRIL: And I have to direct-deposit
the annual bonuses, so if you two

91
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,794
could go be crazy and
horrible elsewhere...?

92
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:30,763
PAM: Like the Tuntmore Towers Hotel,
where Lana's shacked up with Mr.

93
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,599
Archer...
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, what?!

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,302
PAM: Yeah, we can see if he's into all
that freaky gender-reversal stuff.

95
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,537
CYRIL: That -- wait, what?!

96
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,806
PAM: Cyril. I watched for
more than a second.

97
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,641
CYRIL: I -- you --

98
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,940
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, let's go down there!
I own that dump,

99
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:46,445
we can get a suite and totally
spy on Mr. Archer and --

100
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:48,948
CYRIL: Lana! Okay,
I'm going with you.

101
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,449
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah whatever,
but on the way we're --

102
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,485
PAM: Not swingin by the zoo.

103
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:53,887
ARCHER (O.S.): Laaaaame.

104
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,889
LANA: What's lame, Archer?

105
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,290
LANA: The fact that we're up against at
least four highly-trained North Korean

106
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:02,595
agents? Or the fact they've all got--
ARCHER (O.S.): Peppercorns, Lana.

107
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:07,199
LANA: Well, I was gonna say Tokarevs and
Shpagin-41 submachine guns, but yeah,

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,167
let's go with peppercorns.

109
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,101
ARCHER (O.S.): Thank you!

110
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,438
ARCHER: Because without peppercorns,
it's not steak au poivre.

111
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,472
LANA: [annoyed sigh]

112
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,842
ARCHER: It can't be.
By like, definition.

113
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:17,710
LANA: Archer, we're supposed to
be stopping the North Koreans

114
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,848
from buying part of a nuclear bomb, not
ordering every single item on the

115
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,817
room service menu --
ARCHER: Just the dinner menu.

116
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,485
LANA: -- pounding two three-
hundred dollar bottles of

117
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:29,989
Glengoolie Frickin Blue --
ARCHER: Two? I ordered three...

118
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,724
LANA: -- then passing out
on the bed totally naked,

119
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,993
for a -- what'd you call it?

120
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:36,295
ARCHER: Power blackout.
And you're welcome.

121
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:38,097
LANA: Yeah thanks, the memory
of your bare ass will bring

122
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,833
me comfort and warmth during
the coming nuclear winter.

123
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:45,504
ARCHER: Relax, it's North Korea. The
nationstate equivalent of the short-bus.

124
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,138
LANA: Nice.

125
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,176
ARCHER: What's nice is this hot tub. Which
get in, before you blow our cover,

126
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:54,614
any more than you already have, by
not performing your wifely duties.

127
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,616
LANA: Excuse me?

128
00:05:56,617 --> 00:06:01,688
MALORY: You said my card was used at the
Tuntmore Towers Hotel? This morning?

129
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:10,997
MALORY: Hm? Oh yes, I remember now. Yes,
yes, it's all fine, mmmmmkaybyebye.

130
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:14,533
I am literally
going to kill him.

131
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:17,403
GILLETTE: Well, figurative --
MALORY: Literally! I'll lure him to my condo

132
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:21,540
in Miami, drug his steak au poivre,
drive him out to the Everglades,

133
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:25,511
slather him with rancid chicken fat,
and then toss him to the gators!

134
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:29,816
RAY: Pretty specific for a hypothetical...
MALORY: Oh, he is going to pay

135
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:30,984
for this.

136
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:32,351
Literally.

137
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:35,054
Cyril? Cyril.

138
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:40,159
Ugh, fine! Then I'll do it!

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,260
PAM (O.S.): Are they doin it?!

140
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:42,261
Are they bangin?!

141
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,396
CYRIL: No, Pam, they
are not "bangin."

142
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,332
PAM: Well these ribs
sure as hell are.

143
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,834
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, right?

144
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:50,503
We should take some
to the tigers!

145
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,904
PAM: And miss
these two doin it?

146
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,674
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, right...
CYRIL: Will you hags stop it?! Look,

147
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,442
there's nothing going
on over there!

148
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,277
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Unless she's
screaming at him to get it up.

149
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:01,681
CYRIL: She's not --
PAM: That's what she was screamin at you.

150
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,750
Okay, so I watched
the whole thing.

151
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:07,020
CYRIL: Ugh, were you
raised in a barn?!

152
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:11,057
PAM: No. I just slept
out there a lot.

153
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:15,094
LANA: Sooo, you got an ETA on when
you might possibly be ready to help?

154
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:18,865
ARCHER (O.S.): Hard to say, really...
ARCHER: Chi's taking her sweet time here.

155
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:21,567
Not criticizing,
thorough is good.

156
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,705
Look, just gimme ten -- Twenty minutes, and --
LANA: Archer? I don't know how

157
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:28,941
long the North Koreans will be out of
their room, so while you ladies discuss

158
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:32,411
the pros and cons of a clear coat --
ARCHER: You say that like there are cons.

159
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:35,982
LANA: I'll go be thorough at my job and
plant the Geiger counter, so we know

160
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,384
if and when the
uranium shows up.

161
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,119
ARCHER: Do you even know
if that thing works?

162
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,125
[beeping noises]

163
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:51,064
KRIEGER: Well, Pigley Three, that would
certainly explain the glowing...

164
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:54,167
And probably a few other things.

165
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,101
PIGLEY: Grunt.

166
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:02,095
LANA: Why do you let
him push your buttons?

167
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:07,468
Why not push his buttons? Because
he has no buttons. He's buttonless.

168
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,837
The only way to make him as crazy as he
makes you, is to... ha, ha, ha, haaaa.

169
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,278
PAM (O.S.): Seriously...
Who are you, Van Cliburn?

170
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,614
Knock off the tickling
and work that shit.

171
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:23,350
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, right?
A baby could -- unghh!

172
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,986
MASSEUR: I'm sorry, Miss Tunt!
Did that hurt?

173
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,989
CHERYL/CAROL: Yesss...
PAM: Cyril, they bangin yet?

174
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,659
CYRIL: Wh-? No! Actually, Archer's alone...
Lana's either in the bathroom or...

175
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,863
Oh my God! What --
ARCHER: The hell is this bullshit?!

176
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,164
CHI: What?! You say
you want clear coat!

177
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,634
LANA(O.S.): Yeah, why not?
I mean it's not like

178
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,670
it hasn't crossed your mind, and
you're not getting any younger, so --

179
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,371
ARCHER (O.S.): Lanaaa!

180
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:46,540
LANA: Jesus, what?!
Is it the Koreans?!

181
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,976
ARCHER: Only if they're who
screwed me out of my bonus!

182
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:49,510
[crunch]

183
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,377
Which would be weird!

184
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,444
LANA (O.S.): Your bonus?!

185
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,146
ARCHER: If you could
even call it that!

186
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:56,449
What's yours, is it shitty?! Go
online and check your bank account!

187
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,184
LANA: Now. When I'm suction
cupped on a window,

188
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:00,186
thirty stories above the ground.

189
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,989
ARCHER (O.S.): Yeah, you
should have five bars.

190
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,059
LANA: Okay so, it's gonna sound
like I'm hanging up? But -- [BEEP]

191
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,494
ARCHER: Lana. Lana!

192
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,897
Holy shit, I think
she's gone rogue!

193
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:14,234
But whoa, don't pack up. My toes
aren't gonna do themselves.

194
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:16,703
LANA: And even if you're not
necessarily doing it for the right

195
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,573
reasons, he's --
ARCHER (O.S.) Hey! Hey!

196
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,407
LANA: [weary sigh]

197
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:21,675
ARCHER: Phone, gimme!

198
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:25,345
LANA: Did you seriously climb all the way
up here just to see what my bonus is?

199
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:28,949
ARCHER: No, I sarcastically climbed all
the way up here to see what your bonus

200
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,718
is! He said, sarcastically!

201
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,385
Phone!

202
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:35,422
LANA: Okay, Jesus! Keep
your voice... Whoa.

203
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:39,459
ARCHER: Sucks, right? I mean that's not
even -- remotely fair! What the

204
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,160
shit?!

205
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:43,129
LANA: Apparently we're in a crazy
parallel universe, where bonuses are

206
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:51,404
based on merit instead of whether or
not you crawled out of your -- mother!

207
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,506
CYRIL: Lanaaa!

208
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,375
LANA: Archerrrrr!

209
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,409
ARCHER: I'm comiiiiing!

210
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,845
Phrasingboom!

211
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:01,281
Lanaaaa!

212
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,783
LANA: Aaaaaaaaagh! Wh-?!

213
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:07,888
ARCHER: Woooohoohoohooooo!
Ungh!

214
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,491
LANA: Oh my God... Archer... that was...
ARCHER: A ninety-dollar

215
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:12,926
manicure, I know.

216
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:17,931
And I couldn't care less, but Chi...
Lana, she worked really hard on it.

217
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,901
PAM: Oh man, they gotta
bump uglies now!

218
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,202
CYRIL: They -- wait, what?!

219
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:26,272
PAM: Cyril, a near-death experience
is like, the ultimate aphrodisiac!

220
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,541
CAROL/CHERYL: Penultimate. The
ultimate's doing it on top

221
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,777
of a tranqed up tiger.

222
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,547
LANA: So listen...
ARCHER: No you listen, and then shut up --

223
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:37,250
LANA: You shut up, I was on the verge of --
ARCHER: Dying.

224
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,986
LANA: Making a --
ARCHER: Stain on the sidewalk.

225
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:42,022
LANA: Decision! So --
ARCHER: So since we're keeping

226
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:43,624
score for bonus purposes, Lana!

227
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,226
In addition to saving your
life a gazillion times --

228
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:49,362
LANA: Your fault to begin with ARCHER:
Since I started working at ISIS, I've

229
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:53,900
been shot, stabbed, set on fire,
poisoned, shot, sexually assaulted,

230
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:58,739
partially chewed, shot, and declared legally dead!
Twice on the same day!

231
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,941
LANA: You said "shot"
like three times.

232
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,075
ARCHER: That's just by you!

233
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:07,514
Total it's more like... holy shit, nineteen!
And now you get your bonus and mine?!

234
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:11,918
LANA: Archer, I didn't --
ARCHER: Do anything to deserve it! Exactly!

235
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,254
LANA: And again, excuse me?

236
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,657
ARCHER: There is
no excuse for you.

237
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:20,460
LANA: Alrighty. Think
I made my decision.

238
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,928
MALORY: And it is final.

239
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,131
ARCHER (O.S.): Because I
borrowed your credit card?!

240
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,033
MALORY: You didn't
borrow it, you stole it!

241
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:29,803
ARCHER (O.S.): Little column A, little column --
MALORY: Be advised! That until

242
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,439
I say otherwise, Mister Stickyfingers...
ARCHER: Seriously, does this

243
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,307
never dry?

244
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,977
MALORY (O.S.): Lana is
now agent-in-command!

245
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,679
LANA: Wait, what?

246
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,815
ARCHER: Yeah hang on,
you're breaking up?

247
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:49,022
LANA: So, my first command, as
agent-IN-command, she said commandingly, is --

248
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,992
PAM (O.S.): Get in
my big ol vagina!

249
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,061
I'm Lana!

250
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:55,528
CYRIL: Okay, you know what?

251
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,830
ARCHER: I am outta here!

252
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:00,300
LANA: Oh my God, okay, you're abandoning
the mission to go home and pout?!

253
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:04,004
ARCHER: I'm not going home, I'm going
down there to kick some Kim Jong Ass!

254
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,406
LANA: Wh-? No! We're
doing surveillance!

255
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,876
ARCHER: Yeah, which is apparently French
for just sitting around on your ass!

256
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:15,682
LANA: Yeah, which is why it's
surprising that you're so shitty at it!

257
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:18,085
Wh-? No no no Archer don't --
[door slam]

258
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:21,521
LANA: Suck so hard! Rrrgh!

259
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,223
CYRIL: Okay, c'mon,
we're outta here.

260
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:24,257
PAM: What're you, nuts?

261
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:26,492
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God
there's nuts in this?!

262
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:29,262
PAM: Ugh, you're
allergic to penicillin.

263
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,294
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh right.
Aaand...

264
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,396
PAM: There's no
penicillin in this --

265
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,033
CHERYL/CAROL: Good,
cause I'm allergic.

266
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:38,338
PAM: -- because why the hell would there
be penicillin in chocolate mousse?

267
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,173
CHERYL/CAROL: God, gross!

268
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,407
There's moose in this?!

269
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,743
PAM: Not that kind of moose.

270
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:46,012
CHERYL/CAROL: Elk then, whatever, ugh...
CYRIL: Look, you two stay if

271
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,782
you want, I'm leaving. There's
no point spying on Lana,

272
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:49,850
because I trust her completely.

273
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:54,587
CHERYL/CAROL: And also because
they're not even in there anymore?

274
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,522
CYRIL: Little column
A, little column B.

275
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,925
LANA: You are not
jeopardizing this mission!

276
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,061
ARCHER: No yeah, that's
exactly what I'm doing.

277
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:03,630
LANA: Because your ego
needs its own zip code!

278
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,098
I meant I won't allow you!

279
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,200
ARCHER: Allow me?!

280
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:13,439
I mean please, allow me...
NORTH KOREAN AGENT: ISIS!

281
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,113
LANA: Unghh!

282
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,748
ARCHER: [chuckles]

283
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,250
LANA (O.S.): [moaning)

284
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,952
ARCHER: Wow, that's
gotta hurt, huh?

285
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:26,684
LANA: Archer...

286
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,852
ARCHER: No, obviously it hurts
getting Tom Dempsey'd in

287
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,556
the tits like that...
LANA: Archer.

288
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:32,492
ARCHER: But I meant watching
me save your ass for the

289
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:33,960
gazillion and one-th time.

290
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,297
LANA: Archer!

291
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,232
ARCHER: She's in command.

292
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:47,227
ARCHER (O.S.): Oh okay, so I guess
you think this is my fault.

293
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,179
LANA: You guess?

294
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,008
ARCHER: Well I'm not
a mindreader, Lana!

295
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:52,936
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: Silence!

296
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:55,475
We deal with you soon enough!

297
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:59,079
LANA: And by deal with, obviously, he means --
ARCHER: Shoot.

298
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,013
LANA: [SIGH]

299
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:03,583
ARCHER: I mean, I assume. And negativity
is infectious, by the way. You're the

300
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:07,420
agent-in-command, Lana, you should
be focused on keeping my morale --

301
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:11,758
LANA: Hi, excuse me? Could you go ahead
and shoot one or both of us now?

302
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,995
ARCHER: Also a good leader
is never sarcastic.

303
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:17,597
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: Oh, we don't shoot you!
After mission

304
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:22,903
finish, we take you back to glorious
Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

305
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,837

ahead and shoot us.

00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:25,505
LANA: Archer!

307

ARCHER: What Lana, it's
none of those things!

308
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:31,577
Not democratic, not a republic, and
definitely not glorious! Jesus,

watch Frontline once in your life...
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: This ISIS camera, yes?

310
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:39,319
LANA: Uh...
ARCHER: Yes! And as all North Koreans know,

311
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,188
cameras steal your soul, so --
NORTH KOREAN BOSS: It is your

312
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,290
Indians who think that!

313
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,459

we're being racist...!

LANA: Why? Why
did you say that?

324
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:07,814
ARCHER: To lure them closer.

325
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:08,815
LANA: Well it worked.

326
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:12,452
ARCHER: Yeah, they really hate the Japanese...
LANA: You better have a plan.

00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,055
ARCHER: Me? Lana, you're
agent-in-command.

step on your -- Toes!

NORTH KOREAN AGENT: Gaagh!

ARCHER: Nailed it boom!

332
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,295
LANA: How did you...?

333
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:31,204
ARCHER; Do you have any idea how many
times I've had to get out of handcuffs?!

334
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:34,841
ARCHER: Lana!

been arrested so many times.

00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,479
ARCHER: Arrested?

LANA: I -- look, whatever, thanks,
that was actually pretty impressive.

338
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:46,353
ARCHER: Well not really, I thought
this was the door to the hallway.

LANA: Sooo...

all the hot Asian group action?

One, we've got about thirty seconds

349
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,485
before the door is matchsticks. Two,

you over the sound of your wrongness.

to three, which is now what, idiot?!

353
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:30,196

Bet that's the first time
you ever said that. Right?

Okay, now we can go.

you cannot be serious!

I use humor as a coping mechanism.

LANA: I meant --
MALORY: And so, while I think it's hilarious

that your bonuses will now be used to
pay this ridiculous hotel bill...

know what that is?

CHERYL/CAROL: I don't, at all.

find the humor in what should

409
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,105
have been a simple mission
turning into a total farce!

ARCHER: Lana. It was by definition a farce.

411
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,412
MALORY: Capped off by the fact
that no one thought to stick

412
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:01,037
around and catch the madman

413
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,910
selling the uranium!

414
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,806
ARCHER: Lana was in command.

415
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,223
MALORY: Yes, was.

416
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:07,887
LANA: (sigh)
ARCHER: [chuckling]

417

Well there goes my master plan!
