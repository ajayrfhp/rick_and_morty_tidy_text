[Malory] Blackmail?

00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:04,417
[Veronica] Yes, I... I'm afraid so.

3
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:07,477
You see, last night, thieves
burgled the house of my attorney, Al...

4
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:09,417
- Alan Shapiro.
- Why, yes.

5
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:11,577
But how did you know that Mr.
Shapiro was my attorney?

6
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,590
Yeah, Cyril.

7
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,627
Oh. Uh, so, the reason I know that is...

8
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:19,547
- He's an idiot.
- Savant. Photographic memory.

9
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:21,593
My guess is he read that in a newspaper

10
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:23,637
article years ago and never forgot it.

11
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,873
But, you know, many of the world's

12
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,427
great detectives were on the spectrum.

13
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:28,967
Wait. What?

14
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:32,467
Sherlock Holmes, um, Darryl Zero...

15
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:34,517
Please forgive me. I had no idea.

16
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,427
Really? Look at his clothes.

17
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,627
- Hey, you know what...
- [shushing] There, there.

18
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:40,932
At any rate, um, whoever these

19
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,467
people were, they stole, um...

20
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,547
My goodness, look at me. I'm...
I'm shaking like a leaf.

00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,427
- Would you care for a drink?

if you don't have real absinthe,

Oh, that sounds good. I'll have...

25
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:56,607
- There's not enough.
- You were saying?

26
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,447
They stole...

27
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:00,627
Yes. Um, I suppose you could call it

28
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,637
very sensitive information.

29
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:04,607
On a computer disk?

30
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,605
Well, yes, but surely you didn't

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,477
read that in the newspaper.

32
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,447
Intuition and a photographic memory.

33
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,721
It's remarkable, but it can be a bit...

34
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:14,517
Off-putting?

35
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,447
Cyril, get up. Move.

36
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:19,487
Ms. Deane came here for
help, not to be off-put.

37
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:22,558
Now, then, this sensitive information...

38
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,638
- Sterling!
- [clears throat]

39
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:30,517
Um, yes. So, about the disk...

40
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:32,517
You want to get back at us.

41
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:34,597
- You want us to get it back.
- No, Mr. Archer.

42
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:36,775
I need you to get it back,

43
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,617
- desperately.
- [gulp]

44

Which is an excellent segue into a

45
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,487
brief overview of our fee structure.

46
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,607
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Wow, that was brief.

47
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:47,487
Payable upon delivery.

48
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,487
Now, if you will excuse me, I...

49
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,497
I think we might have more questions.

50
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,627
I'm sure you do, but Mr.
Shapiro will have to answer them.

51
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:55,567
He's waiting for you at his house now.

52
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,587
- The house that got robbed?
- "Burgled," Lana. Pay attention.

53
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:01,427
And so, Miss Deane, do
you want me to ride with you?

54
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,587
Because my car is currently...

55
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,417
- Merde.
- No!

56
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,627
No, Mr. Archer. Mr. Shapiro

57
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,407
will handle everything from now on.

58
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,407
And if all goes according to plan,

59
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,567
this will be the last time we ever meet.

60
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,417
- Wait. No. Ever?
- I am standing right here.

Yeah, exactly, when clearly we're

in order to blackmail the
real Veronica Deane.

And paid us with a bogus cashier's check

for a hundred thousand dollars, which...

00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,427
That's only because I
threatened to have them deported.

163
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:11,597
They've been with me at least...

164
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,447
Oh, wow. Rosa's been with me 20 years.

165
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,447
[chuckles] Anyway, the vet just left.

166
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,001
They were so dehydrated. We had 'em

167
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,467
on IV drips, the whole megillah.

168
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:21,477
- The maids?
- Th... The dogs!

169
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,467
Oh, my God, I am so sorry...

170
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,627
that that happened.

171
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:28,567
I'll tell you who's
sorry, is my flokati rug.

172
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,740
Oh, and my worthless bodyguards.

173
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,437
Right. And they are...

174
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,530
Fired! And lucky they're not slowly

175
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,447
dissolving in a 50-gallon drum!

176
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,437
She trusted me!

177
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,538
Veronica trusted me to protect

178
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:40,637
the disk, and I failed her!

179
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,606
Okay, well, maybe. But we're gonna

180
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,517
get it back, right, with a plan?

181
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,557
[exhaling]

182
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:50,477
Yes. I'm sorry. Those vermin
called this morning,

183
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,597
gave me instructions on
where to bring this...

184
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:55,417
two million dollars in bearer bonds.

185
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,517
Holy shit, we should've kept the disk.

186
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,517
Safe... from the bad guys.

187
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,437
And by "we," obviously I meant "you."

188
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,557
So...

189
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:06,557
Wow. Hurtful.

190
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,457
Okay, let's go meet these bastards.

191
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,457
Okay. A, you won't need that.

192
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,527
And B, we need to check
in with the agency.

193
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,143
Or... roll with me... we don't

194
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,597
check in yet, or at all,

195
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,441
which means we decide how many

196
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,407
hours we worked on this case,

197
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:21,587
and not Cyril, who, I
hate to bring this up,

198
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,507
just this morning, in
front of everybody,

199
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:27,448
made you his giant bitch.

200
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,467
Well, you two coming, or what?

201
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,527
Okay. They said come
alone, but I don't drive,

202
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,447
so they said I could bring my chauffeur.

203
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,587
So somebody gets a snappy uniform,

204
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,467
and somebody else gets
to hide in the trunk.

205
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,588
[English accent] I trust
milady shan't be

206
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,607
overly discomfited whilst in the boot.

207
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,996
I bet you get this all the time, but

208
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:49,577
have you ever done any modeling, or...

209
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:53,527
Oh, and just so you
know, a woman chauffeur is a...

210
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,487
- ow...
- [horn honks]

211
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,487
Chauffeuse,

212
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,418
you dumb idiots.

213
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,838
[Malory] Wait. What?

214
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,038
What do you mean, they
haven't checked in?

215
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,858
- Uhhh...
- [chair squeaking]

216
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,998
I mean that...

217
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,058
they haven't checked in.

218
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:18,058
Wha... So no one's heard from them?

219
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,838
- Uh-uuhhh.
- No-o-ope.

220
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,858
So we've got two agents in the field...

221
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,362
"Investigators"! I thought I

222
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,918
was very clear about that.

223
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,008
And also about how excessive spinning

224
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,978
causes premature wear on the bearings!

225
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,019
- Cyril...
- And I bet they

226
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,008
haven't checked in,

227
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,503
because they're trying to stick it to

228
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:34,918
the man, who, in this case, is me.

229
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,008
- And in this case only.
- Stop spinning!

230
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,239
- Cyril, you stop.
- What,

231
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,028
protecting innocent bearings?

232
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,908
- Being yourself!
- What?

233
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,898
[both] Ooohh!

234
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,048
- Excuse me?
- Cyril, you have been given

235
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,048
the opportunity of a lifetime...

236
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,978
a new job, a new city
where no one knows you,

237
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,008
which means you can reinvent yourself.

238
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,948
You can be anyone you want.

239
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,048
So why would you keep being you?

240
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,858
Huh.

241
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,008
And that goes for the rest of you.

242
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,898
Don't be the same feckless
idiots you were

243
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,858
when this was a spy agency.

244
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:07,968
[chairs squeaking]

245
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,978
Oh, come on. Just literally yesterday,

246
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,982
you were all so excited about your

247
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,928
first case, and now look at you.

248
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,928
[whirring]

249
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,851
So get off your collective ass and

250
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,938
get me a sit-rep on my field agents!

251
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,028
"Investigators."

252
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,958
I am, you know, still the boss.

253
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,878
Well, but only when I'm not here.

254
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,978
[Lana] Okay, I think we're here.

255
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,988
[Archer] Do you? Do
you think that, Lana?

256
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,828
Calm down, Fran Trunkington.

257
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,018
- Forced.
- Oh, for the...

258
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,828
- Trunky Brewster, then.
- Ehh!

259
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,109
Oh, man, I hope that's not them.

260
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,018
Although that seems unrealistic.

261
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,918
Okay, Archer, we've got
nine... check that... ten bandits, 12:00.

262
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,018
Copy that, Mav. What's the hard deck?

263
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,028
Okay, you know what? [sighs]

264
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,919
Never mind. Come on, Poppin' Fresh.

265
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,898
- Are you coming?
- Are you gonna open my door?

266
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,918
- [laughing]
- I know, right? She's like...

267
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,918
[grunts] Ow!

268
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,838
So, are you and Archer,

269
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,918
- you know?
- [sighs] Unfortunately.

270
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,829
You the Jew lawyer?

271
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,391
[sighs] Yes. Yes. I believe

272
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,838
we spoke on the phone.

273
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,828
- You got the money?
- Yes.

274
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,166
Two million dollars in bearer

275
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:24,918
bonds, as per our verbal agreement.

276
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,928
- What are you doing? Get the disk.
- [man laughing]

277
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:29,948
Oh, well, get a load of Miss Daisy.

278
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,888
[men laughing]

279
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,859
- Ehh.
- Now, you give the

280
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,828
case to Ocho there,

281
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,998
and I'll give Miss Daisy the D-isk.

282
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,828
[clears throat] You done?

283
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,058
Almost. But I gotta ask...

284
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,039
- [man] Where's the frickin' money?
- What?

285
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,048
- Run! [grunts]
- What...

286
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,878
- Son of a...
- [guns cocking]

287
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,998
[sighs]

288
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,233
Man, I hope you got health insurance.

289
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:57,978
Look...

290
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:59,958
Shut up!

291
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,998
The rest of you, mount up.

292
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,038
Sandy Trunkin.

293
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,968
Trunkin Hines. Archie Trunker.

294
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,928
- Ooh, Archie Trunker's Place.
- [car door opens, closes]

295
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,838
- [engine starts]
- Hmm.

296
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,958
That was quick.

297
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,058
Trunk...

00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,038

<i>This is Lana Kane. Please leave a...</i>

305
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:35,008
Five times, straight to voice-mail!

306
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,938
- Y'all, that's not like her.
- You think she's in danger?

307
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,990
Who knows? If they went to meet the

308
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,928
blackmailers, no backup, then...

309
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,058
Aw, jeez, you guys are freaking me out!

[grunts]

311
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,948
Okay, so as distasteful as it may be,

312
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,928
- you have to at least try him.
- No! No.

313
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,672
I don't care if they are in danger.

314
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,028
I am not calling Sterling.

hoax! Voicemail hoax! [squawking]

[normal voice] I don't care if they're

317
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,923
getting stuffed into a wood chipper.

318
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,038
Huh? Wuzza? Oh, man.

You, move the limo. As matter of fact,

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,878
- move it all the way down to Pearl's.

out, like, seven or eight, so...

480
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,021
- Goddamn!
- Yeah. Pretty beat.

481
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:16,543
So, is there any liquor back here?

482
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:18,021
Like, even cooking sherry, or...

483
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,932
My point is, there's probably only

484
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:21,951
two or three bikers left out there.

485
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,877
So go beat 'em up. Get the keys, get

486
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,801
the disk, and let's get outta here.

487
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:26,961
- [door opens]
- [man] Already?

488
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:30,871
Don't you even wanna know who
hired us for the handoff?

489
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:32,891
It was you!

490
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,951
You had the fake Veronica
Deane hire us to steal that disk!

491
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:37,991
What? Get... [grunting]

492
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,851
Ow! No, it wasn't me.

493
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,687
I'd never do that to Veronica.

494
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,791
If that disk gets out, she'll be ruined.

495
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:47,841
And I'm... And I'm in love with her.

496
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,001
[sighs] Of course you are.

497
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,871
Oh, don't be jealous, baby.

498
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,951
You and I will always have what we had.

499
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:55,931
- Wait. What? What?
- Uh, so, who did hire you?

500
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,001
That's for me to
know and you to find out.

501
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,755
Well, and for us to find out,

502
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,931
too, since we don't know, either.

503
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,881
Or why I said that out loud.

504
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,953
What we do know is that our cut

505
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,891
of two mil is ten percent.

506
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:10,059
So, unless
somebody's got two hundred grand

507
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,931
burning a hole in their pocket, I...

508
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,596
I have a cashier's check for that exact

509
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,011
amount, literally, in my pocket.

510
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:17,339
It was to pay these private dicks.

511
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,801
But if their actions

512
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,801
don't constitute breach
of contract, then...

513
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:22,821
Well, I'll just go ahead and take that.

514
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,011
- [mechanical whining]
- [guns cocking]

515
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,812
I already got dibs.

516
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,841
And why the hell are you naked?

517
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:33,801
It's after Labor Day.

518
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:34,961
You ain't gonna get away with this.

519
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:37,841
I'm gonna hunt you down, like... Ow!

520
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,921
Tell it to the cops, shit-bird.

521
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,402
Although obviously never speak to the

522
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:42,831
police without an attorney present.

523
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,831
[sighs] Thanks for coming, you guys.

524
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:46,851
- Oh, my tits, whaaat!
- No.

525
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,971
- We're back to saying "phrasing."
- [scoffs] I'm not.

526
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,851
Well, apparently we're
not saying "thank you."

527
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,941
Thank you, Mother, for arriving.

528
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,851
Wait. So, could Ray not be bothered?

529
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,022
He's outside, securing the perimeter.

530
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,831
Say I won't.

531
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:05,901
Good work, Ray. Thanks for coming.

532
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:07,021
Oh, my tits, whaaat!

533
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,891
What are you wearing?

534
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,021
[chuckling] What are you wearing?

535
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,891
Thought I might have to go undercover.

536
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,011
- As what?
- A biker, dum-dum.

537
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,811
[chuckling] It's
just you look kind of gay.

538
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:19,981
- I look gay.
- A little bit. Yeah.

539
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:22,871
Well, did you see Lana? Hey,
Earl Campbell called.

540
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,792
He wants his thighs back.

541
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:33,260
[Cyril] Okay, so,
first case... pros and cons.

542
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,254
Well, we got tricked into blackmailing

543
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,350
Veronica Deane, beloved Hollywood icon.

544
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:39,420
- Yeah, that's definitely a con.
- But then we...

545
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,220
Well, I totally kicked
ass and got the disk back.

546
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,360
I will begrudge you a pro.

547
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,220
Although I didn't get to
give it to her in person.

548
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:49,240
- Maybe over cocktails.
- Pro.

549
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,761
Also, we never found out what's on it

550
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,320
or what "Longwater" even means, so...

551
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,260
Because it's none of our business!

552
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,300
Oh, and speaking of business,

553
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:57,781
Shapiro said he'd recommend us to any

554
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,360
of his clients that might need PI work.

555
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:02,240
Ooh, the case of the missing kishke.

556
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,360
Oh, and I also got stabbed.

557
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,390
How is that a pro, you dick?

558
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,280
Learning experience?

559
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:10,370
Well, joke's on you. I
didn't learn anything.

560
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,270
There's your fridge magnet.

561
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,410
So, all in all, I'd
say our first case was

562
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,370
a bit of a mixed bag.

563
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,250
Oh, I don't know.

564
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,370
Two hundred thousand
dollars for two days' work?

565
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:22,390
That's not too shabby, people.

566
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:24,440
Two hundred thousand divided

567
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,270
by eight equal shares.

568
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:29,270
That's... Holy shit-snacks!
25 grand each?

569
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,200
Wait. What do you mean, "equal shares"?

570
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:33,210
What do you think
this is, a pirate ship?

571
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:36,280
Well, there's an easy way to find out.

572
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,196
Like, I assume there's some sort

573
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:40,290
of leather-bound ship's registry

574
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,240
in the office of the Lord High Admiral.

575
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,360
Ugh! Fine! I'll find it myself.

576
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:47,625
Idiots!

577
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:53,722
