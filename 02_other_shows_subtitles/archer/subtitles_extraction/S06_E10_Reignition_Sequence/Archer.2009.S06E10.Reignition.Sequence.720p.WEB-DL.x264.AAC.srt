Oh, yes I do.
Come on, just the tip.

00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,066
I don't know.
It's pretty big.

00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,935
I think it's just a standard
breakfast burrito size.

Here. First take
a bite of mine.

No, first you take
a bite of mine.
Let's do it together.

Is that crazy?
Oh, my god, okay.

Broom closet.

No. Bring the burrito.

That, and how
chili's not breakfast.

we're doomed to be alone.

Well, your face.

Wait, nobody's

34
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:20,404
Yeah, that's her point.
And think how hard
watching them

35
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,672
Must be for cyril.
No! It's--

That's not--
I mean, come on!

I'm totally
over lana, so...

You can lie to yourself--

Obviously,
look at your sweater.

But don't lie
to team breakup.

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,717
Guys, it's obvious
what we got to do!

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,319
Throw acid in
their kissy faces.

43
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:37,754
No!
Wait!

44
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:39,423
You want to try
to break them up?

45
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,758
I mean, it's
either that or...
Ssss...

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,529
No! The solution to every
problem isn't throwing
frickin' acid on it!

47
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:49,099
Unless the problem
is a solution with
an overly-alkaline ph balance.

48
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,768
Krieger, hush! Pam?
You have a plan?

49
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,271
I don't know. Maybe
we could do something like
one of those bait cars?

50
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:56,706
But obviously, the car
would be a vagina.

51
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,508
Hmm. Okay,
so we get a woman

52
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,243
That archer would
find irresistible.

53
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,045
Maybe by having
her fog a mirror.

54
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,346
Then put her
in archer's path,

55
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,748
And his pathological
need to sleep

56
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,716
With every woman
he meets does the rest.

57
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,286
Or, you know, a lot
of couples break up
if their kid dies.

58
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,387
Really?
Whoa!

59
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,022
Yeah. Easy peasy.

60
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:15,392
We hire somebody to kidnap
their fat, gross baby.

61
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:17,594
There's this huge
man-slash-baby hunt.

62
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,229
It's in all the newspapers.

On the wireless.
America's going apeshit.

64
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,633
Then, we double-cross
the kidnapper,

65
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:26,703
Who obviously we paid
with easily-traceable
gold certificates.

66
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,573
We plant a shitload of
dicey evidence in his garage.

he's basically convicted
of being german,

why we can't tell mother

Because she'd try to

She can't stand for me

00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,935
Which-- here are your flyers.
Yeah, I actually
don't need them.

449
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:14,703
What? After I made
all these copies?

450
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:16,972
Well, who's gonna
put 'em up, lana?
Hey! Whoa.

451
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,376
I did not just
schlep my ass up your
jillion idiot stairs

452
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:22,845
To eat your shitty
attitude for dinner, mister.
I--

453
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,115
I might as well go
eat with cyril. At least
he can cook stir-fry.

454
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:28,651
And, he's still
totally in love with me.
Wha'?

455
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:32,321
Yeah. Right outside,
just dumped his purse
all over the welcome mat.

456
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,456
Ugh! So pathetic.

457
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,226
Seriously. Maybe
try growing a pair.

458
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,795
But here I am
with the old archer.
Wha'--

459
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:42,698
I'm not the old archer.
I'm the new archer!

460
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,968
I've changed, lana.
Please, you're halfway
to half in the bag.

461
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,304
As usual, walkin' around
in your--

462
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,172
Why are you in
your spreefs?

463
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,541
They compliment
my active lifestyle?

464
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,310
Archer...
Um...

465
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:57,012
Uh-huh.
Oh, what, what, lana!

466
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,981
Wait! No, there's
nothing in there.

467
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:01,550
You call this nothing?

468
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,052
Yeah, so...

469
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:07,489
Because I call it
smoochy-boochy town.
Uh-- hmm?

470
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:10,092
Smooth jazz, rose petals,
candles--

471
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:14,330
Not sure what happened
there, but oh, my gosh!
And dom pÃ©rignon?

472
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,265
Which, I assume,
was delicious.

473
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,734
Uh, expensive
fire extinguisher.

474
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,270
Well, then go get a few more
bottles out of the fridge

475
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:25,674
Just to be safe, because
I am gonna burn you down!

476
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:27,343
[giddy laughter]

477
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,578
Back in a sec,

478
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,447
New archer...

479
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:34,683
Yeah. I-I am new!
I am, lana.

480
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,885
I mean, I feel like
a brand new man!

481
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,187
I've really changed!

482
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,956
[lana]
really?
Ee-yah!

483
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,459
[clears throat]
then why...

484
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:47,096
[shouting]
is there a vagina
in the sink!

485
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:51,867
Um, so...
Funny story.
