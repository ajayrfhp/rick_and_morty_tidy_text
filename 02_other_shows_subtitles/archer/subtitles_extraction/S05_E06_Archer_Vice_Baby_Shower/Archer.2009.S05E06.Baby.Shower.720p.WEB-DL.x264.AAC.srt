you're not sleeping now?

those bosoms of yours a favor,

00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,215

years.

82
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,298

>> MALORY: The point is, they

88
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,340
steal from you; it's just the

89
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:06,075
cost of doing business.

00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:15,184
the money, I would get the hell

97

108
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,731
would be.

(all groaning)

116
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:19,748

want, but no one is eating Eggs

118
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,751
Woodhouse until you people start

119
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,253
bringing in some money!

120
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,121
>> ARCHER: But they were already

121
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,288
cooked; what good does it do

122
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,456
to throw them away?

123
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,324
>> MALORY: None.

124
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:29,658
That's the whole point.

125
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,794
And no cocaine donuts for you!

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,130
I got to load up my body before

128

cocaine online.

00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,571
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, if it's insane

135
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,240
to use an X-gen asymmetric onion

136
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,307
router and digital

137
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,408
cryptocurrency to sell your

139
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,612
completely risk-free.

00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,648
Or a lot of the other shit I do.

142
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,849

e-mail you, or...?

144
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,285
>> KRIEGER: No.

145
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,319
It's like shopping online, only

146
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,454
for cocaine.

147
00:03:58,456 --> 00:03:59,955
I've already sold, uh...

148
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:02,625
Wow, almost 800 grand worth.

149

>> MALORY: Really?

150
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,827
But how do we get paid?

151
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:05,694
>> KRIEGER: With a totally

untraceable digital currency

153
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:07,830
that we can exchange for real

U.S. dollars whenever we want.

155
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,668
I call 'em Kriegerrands.

156
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,669
>> MALORY: And then how do they

157
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,670
get the cocaine?

158
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,671
>> KRIEGER: We pack it up and

159
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,939
ship it, easy peasy.

160
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,707
At least in theory!

163
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,380
I'll send up some help.

164
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,447
And, missy, you had better watch

165
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,516
it.

166
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:31,987

00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,895
Lana.

174
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,231
La...

175
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,971
>> CHERLENE: What's up her

176
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,873
gigantic giant ass?

177
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,707
>> RAY: Wh...

178
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,042
Probably you shitheads!

179
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:53,876
>> OTHERS: What did we do?

180
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,743
>> RAY: Besides keeping

181
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:55,744
everybody up all night with your

182
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:56,979
damn hootenannies...

183
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,880
>> ARCHER: Wait, that was a

184
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,215
hootenanny?

185
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,249
>> RAY: ...has anybody even

186
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,584
thought about throwing her a

187
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,018
goddamn baby shower?!

188
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,752
>> CHERLENE: Ew!

189
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:04,420
>> PAM: Um...

190
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:05,254
>> CYRIL: Pfft, you mean a

191
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:05,921
bastard sh... Ow!

192
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:06,822
>> ARCHER: Cyril, shut your

193
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:08,257
pout-hole, accept the fact that

194
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,525
Lana was so far out of your

195
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,926
league that impregnating her

196
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,361
would've basically been

197
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,696
interspecies breeding, and get

198
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,864
on with your life!

199
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,700
And then go get a cake.

200
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:18,701
Okay, Ray...

201
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:19,735
>> MALORY: Ray, Cyril, go help

202
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,403
Krieger pack the cocaine.

203
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,838
Cherlene, go pick or grin or

204
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,739
something, and the rest of

205
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,573
you...

206
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,574
>> ARCHER: We're throwing Lana

207
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,508
a baby shower.

208
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,409
>> MALORY: Wh...?

209
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,777
We haven't done that yet?

210
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,579
I said move, people!

211
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,914
Go, go, go, go, go!

212
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,415
(Ray bleats)

213
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,583
Idiots.

214
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,751
All right, I need them here

215
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,785
making music and packaging

216
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,787
cocaine, so this baby shower is

217
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,955
up to you.

218
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,457
Don't cock it up like you did

219
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,858
Texas!

220
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,726
>> PAM: Hey!

221
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:44,627
>> MALORY: Oh, blow it out

222
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:45,628
your ass!

223
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,629
(Pam farts)

224
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,630
(Archer laughs)

225
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:48,631
>> ARCHER: I was hoping you'd

226
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,632
do that.

227
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,633
Okay, we should make a list.

228
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:52,568
Item one: some paper to write

229
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,902
said list on.

230
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:54,803
(gasps)

231
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,372
Item two... Woodhouse!

232
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,439
Get in here!

233
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,440
>> WOODHOUSE: Sir?

234
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,541
>> ARCHER: Here, here's...

235
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,809
400 bucks; go get all the stuff

236
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,311
for a baby shower: cake,

237
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:03,712
decorations, some of those water

238
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,481
guns shaped like dicks...

239
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:06,548
>> PAM: I think that's

240
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,549
bachelorette parties.

241
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:08,617
>> ARCHER: Really?

242
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,619
Wow, okay, that explains...

243
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,787
Uh, never mind.

244
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,955
And, Woodhouse,

245
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,323
if you spend any of this on

246
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,891
heroin, you better buy enough to

247
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:16,992
O.D. on, bec...

248
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:17,993
>> WOODHOUSE: Will do!

249
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,428
>> ARCHER: Will don't!

250
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,496
>> PAM: Wait, so if Woodhouse is

251
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:21,563
getting everything we need for

252
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:22,498
the party, then...

253
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,666
>> ARCHER: Oh, not everything,

254
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,600
Pam.

255
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,101
Because... you and I are going

256
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,671
to get Kenny Loggins to play

257
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:30,105
Lana's baby shower.

258
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,774
>> PAM: Goddamn it.

259
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,742
>> ARCHER: Pam.

260
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,677
Pam.

261
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,011
(inhales)

262
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,980
>> PAM: What?!

263
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,815
>> ARCHER: ¶ Danger zone.

264
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:40,983
Wait, wait, wait, no.

265
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,685
¶ This is it.

266
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,652
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, you guys box

267
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,820
it up, I slap on a mailing label

268
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,088
from the printer, bing bang

269
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,823
boom, it's good to go zoom.

270
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,991
>> CYRIL: So, why are we in

271
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,025
our underwear?

272
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:51,093
>> KRIEGER: Eh, don't worry

273
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:52,127
about it.

274
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,128
>> PAM: Because it kind of seems

275
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,630
like this is about you and not

276
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,698
really about Lana.

277
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,032
>> ARCHER: Okay, A, Lana loves

278
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,100
Kenny Loggins.

279
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,101
>> PAM: Really?

280
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,102
>> ARCHER: I don't know.

281
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,637
I mean, I assume she does.

282
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,705
I do.

283
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:03,806
>> GUARD: Whoa, whoa, where you

284
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:04,807
think you're going?

285
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:05,874
>> ARCHER: Uh, well, to give Mr.

286
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,476
Loggins his wardrobe.

287
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:08,777
>> GUARD: Not without a pass

288
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,812
you're not.

289
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:10,979
>> ARCHER: Yeah, we...

290
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,114
>> PAM: Hey, I appreciate you're

291
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,282
just doing your job, but if

292
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,650
Kenny doesn't get this

293
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:15,684
embroidered hippie shirt and

294
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,685
these gigantic bell-bottoms, I

295
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,686
highly doubt you'll have a job

296
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,687
tomorrow.

297
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,688
>> GUARD: Look, he ain't even

298
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,689
here.

299
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,690
He's probably still at the

300
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,691
Tuntmore.

301
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,692
>> PAM: Now, was that so hard...

302
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,693
neck nuts?

303
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,794
>> ARCHER: Good instincts back

304
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:26,795
there, Pam.

305
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,063
That's what we field agents

306
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,798
call... Hmm.

307
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,833
Guess I'm not a field agent

308
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,067
anymore though.

309
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,569
(Pam laughs)

310
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,070
>> PAM: Man, you got to miss it.

311
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,739
What a rush!

312
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:37,906
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I miss it, but

313
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,074
calm down.

314
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,175
Jesus, it's not like you killed

315
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:41,577
a guy.

316
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,678
Taxi!

317
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,679
(car door closes)

318
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:44,913
Okay, so phase two may call for

319
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:46,048
some field craft.

320
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,649
A, there's no way a superstar

321
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,851
like Kenny Loggins is gonna be

322
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,152
registered under his own name.

323
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,153
>> PAM (laughs): Yeah.

324
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,521
It's not like he's Messina.

325
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:53,522
>> ARCHER: Don't do that.

326
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:54,523
Don't ever do that!

327
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,891
>> PAM: Sorry! Geez!

328
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:56,825
>> ARCHER: You should be.

329
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:57,926
Jim Messina is a genius, and

330
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,162
without him, no Poco.

331
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:01,663
Where was I?

332
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:02,731
Oh, yeah, we'll probably need to

333
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,732
access the computer terminal at

334
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,767
reception, so just follow my

335
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:05,768
lead.

336
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,769
>> PAM: Could I just follow

337
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,770
Kenny Loggins?

338
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,771
>> ARCHER: Wha...?

339
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:09,772
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Well, maybe

340
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:10,773
because it's in the rider,

341
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:11,774
which I'll be happy to come down

342
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:12,775
there and shove up his ass.

343
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:13,776
>> ARCHER: Uh, excuse me, Mr.

344
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:14,777
Loggins?

345
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:15,778
Hi, I'm, uh...

346
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,779
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Uh-huh,

347
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:17,780
uh-huh, uh-huh.

348
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:18,781
>> ARCHER: What the shit,

349
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:19,782
Loggins?!

350
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:20,783
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Ricky, bad

351
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:21,784
touch!

352
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,851
>> RICKY: Hands off Mr. Loggins!

353
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:23,852
>> ARCHER: Hands off me, Lurch.

354
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:24,853
Look at my suit.

355
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:25,854
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Zap, Ricky,

356
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:26,855
zap!

357
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:27,856
>> ARCHER: Hey... Aah!

358
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:28,857
(Pam screams)

359
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:30,225
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Uh, hang on.

360
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:31,560
Hit him again.

361
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:32,694
>> PAM: Wait! No, no, no, no!

362
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,729
>> ARCHER: What?! I...

363
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,063
(grunting gibberish)

364
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,198
>> KENNY LOGGINS: What's that?

365
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,633
No, no, never mind.

366
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:38,801
It's just a fan.

367
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:39,935
(Archer groans)

368
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,136
>> PAM: Holy shit zaps!

369
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,137
Are you okay?

370
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,205
(Archer coughs)

371
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,573
>> ARCHER: Yeah, and I don't

372
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:45,908
know about you, but I'm gonna be

373
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,142
pretty upset if I end up having

374
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:50,579
to murder Kenny Loggins.

375
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:52,648
>> PAM: Meh.

376
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:56,819
>> ARCHER: Yeah, that's fair!

377
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,820
Kick out the guy whose custom

378
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:00,055
Super 220 wool suit was ruined

379
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:01,457
by Kenny Loggins!

380
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,458
And where were you during all

381
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,459
that?

382
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,626
>> PAM: Oh, man, I was like,

383
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,462
"What?!"

384
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,430
So, what's up? What's the plan?

385
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:09,431
>> ARCHER: (sighs) The plan is

386
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,600
shut up and come on.

387
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,068
>> GILLETTE: No, we have to play

388
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,603
games at the baby shower.

389
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,071
There's Don't Drop the Baby, uh,

390
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,940
Dirty Diaper Game...

391
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,575
>> CYRIL: What in God's name is

392
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,676
the Dirty Diaper Game?

393
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:21,677
>> GILLETTE: Oh, my God, it's

394
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,678
hilarious.

395
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,679
You get a bunch of newborn

396
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:24,746
diapers, then you microwave

397
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:25,848
different candy bars...

398
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,516
>> CYRIL: Stop! Yeah, let me

399
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,951
just stop you there, because if

400
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:30,085
you finish that sentence, I'm

401
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,587
going to rub cocaine in your

402
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:32,688
eyes until you are blind.

403
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,590
>> GILLETTE: Goddamn, Shawshank.

404
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:35,824
>> LANA: Uh, Malory?

405
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,825
(Malory screams)

406
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,826
>> LANA: What?!

407
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,094
>> MALORY: What... do you want?

408
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:40,095
Jesus.

409
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:41,096
>> LANA: I, um...

410
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,764
Okay, so, as you know, or should

411
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,500
know, I'm pregnant and...

412
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,501
>> MALORY: (sighs) Lana, it's

413
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,502
too late to...

414
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,503
>> LANA: Okay, let me stop you.

415
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,504
Having the baby-- don't know why

416
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,505
that's such a mindbender for

417
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,506
everybody, but...

418
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,507
>> MALORY (chuckling): Well...

419
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,674
>> LANA: But... Hush. I have a

420
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,809
lot of pretty major expenses

421
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:54,977
coming up, and since we haven't

422
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:57,479
been paid...

423
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,480
(sighs) Look, I hate to ask, but

424
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,481
I need...

425
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:00,482
>> MALORY: WIC!

426
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:01,383
>> LANA: What?

427
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,384
>> MALORY: It's like welfare but

428
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:03,385
for babies.

429
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:04,386
I don't know-- I'm not a

430
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:05,387
Democrat.

431
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,388
But I think they give you a

432
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,823
birth cheese.

433
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:08,991
(lock clicks)

434
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,125
>> LANA: A birth cheese.

435
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,126
>> MALORY: Oh, for...

436
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,694
Nothing's ever good enough.

437
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,795
>> WOODHOUSE: Sorry.

438
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,797
I only had $200.

439
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,798
>> MALORY: Not you.

440
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,801
Really? $200?

441
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:20,802
>> ARCHER: Okay, there's $200

442
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,704
for the uniforms, $100 for the

443
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,173
sweet wigs and another $300 for

444
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,709
Kenny Loggins' room number.

445
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,044
>> HOUSEKEEPER: Mm-hmm.

446
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,079
>> PAM: So, I'm curious-- why

447
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,080
didn't you just call Cherlene,

448
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,849
who owns the hotel?

449
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:34,850
>> ARCHER: (sighs) And I'm

450
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:35,918
curious-- why didn't you remind

451
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,085
me about that until just now?

452
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,086
>> PAM: You said shut up,

453
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,087
J. Alfred Gotrocks.

454
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,088
>> ARCHER: What?

455
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,089
>> PAM: We haven't been paid in

456
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,024
forever.

457
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,025
Where are you getting all this

458
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:44,026
money?

459
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,527
>> ARCHER: I, uh...

460
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,162
sold some artwork?

461
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,697
>> CHERLENE: Goddamn it!

462
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,731
What did I tell you about

463
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,900
staying up on the wall, ghosts?!

464
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,068
>> ARCHER: Okay, since I am or

465
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,171
was a world-class secret agent,

466
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,539
when we get up to his room, do

467
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,207
actually follow my lead or...

468
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,542
>> PAM: Hang on, let me grab a

469
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,543
name tag.

00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:02,711
>> ARCHER: (gasps) Ruby! Ruby!

471
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,712
Is there a Ruby?

472
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:04,713
See if there's a Ruby.

473
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,014
Is there a Ruby?!

474
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,049
>> PAM: It's pretty close to

475
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,050
Ruby.

476
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:09,051
>> ARCHER: No, Pam, it isn't.

477
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:10,052
>> PAM: Well, why do...

478
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:11,053
>> ARCHER: Don't worry about it.

479
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:12,054
Let it go.

480
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,589
And give me one of those mints.

481
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,557
>> PAM: Dude, they're cocaine.

482
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,592

483
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,759
they are.

484
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,760
>> PAM: (laughs) Right?

485
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,795
>> ARCHER: All right, here's the

486
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:20,796
penthouse.

487
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:21,797
Now, I cannot stress this

488
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,732
enough, Pam: follow my lead.

489
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:24,800

490
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,034

you 20 grand a month?

501
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,049
I don't want to read about Kenny

502

service waiter, I probably

00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:52,794
won't, but...

512
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,101
>> ARCHER: Sure, you did.

513
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,936
>> KENNY LOGGINS: No, I didn't.

514
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,237
(crash, glass shatters)

515
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,739
(Pam grunting)

516
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,740
>> ARCHER: A housekeeper and/or

517
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:05,641
prostitute?

518
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:06,642
>> KENNY LOGGINS: You think

519
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,743
K-Log needs to pay for sex, do

520
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,910
you?

521
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,278
>> ARCHER: Mm... no, but, that

522
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,748
being said, I do think he needs

523
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,249
to reevaluate this whole K-Log

524
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,751
thing.

525
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:16,752
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, yeah?

526
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:17,753
Well, I think you need to

527
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:18,987
reevaluate your face.

528
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,288
>> ARCHER: My... Oh.

529
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,289
(chuckles) Okay.

530
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,290
I can explain that.

531
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,291
>> KENNY LOGGINS: How?

532
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:25,193
>> ARCHER: Uh... lip chemo?

533
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,194
>> RICKY: It's the crazy guy

534
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:27,195
from the lobby.

535
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,196
Which means you're no

536
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,665
prostitute.

537
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,333
>> PAM: And, that being said, I

538
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,301
am open to blow jobs for money.

539
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,302
I only got eight bucks on me,

540
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,303
but...

541
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,304
>> ARCHER: Pam!

542
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,873
Self-esteem, buddy. Come on.

543
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,007
Now, let's just put the gun down

544
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,008
and...

545
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,009
>> RICKY: Mr. Loggins, please

546
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,010
advise.

547
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,011
>> KENNY LOGGINS: K-Log.

548
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,112
K-Log, damn it.

549
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,180
>> RICKY: Yeah, I'm kind of with

550
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,682
him on that one.

551
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,683
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, really?

552
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,151
So you agree with Borgnar's

553
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,019
pathetic little errand boy?

554
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,020
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?

555
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,021
And also who?

556
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,022
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Well, I'll

557
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,123
tell you the same thing I told

558
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,124
Borgnar that night in Caracas.

559
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,159
It's not for sale.

560
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,160
At any price.

561
00:12:58,162 --> 00:12:59,161
>> ARCHER: Who the hell is

562
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,162
Bor... (grunts)

563
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,163
(gunshot, glass shatters)

564
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,164
(Pam shouts)

565
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,165
(Ricky screams)

566
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,166
(gunshots)

567
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,167
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Hi-yah!

568
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,168
(Archer grunts)

569
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,169
Ricky, attack!

570
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,737
>> PAM (chuckling): Yeah, Ricky.

571
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,039
(Ricky and Pam grunting)

572
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,240
(Ricky screams)

573
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:13,675
>> ARCHER: Okay. Okay, good.

574
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,843
Pam, are you good?

575
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,713
>> PAM (chuckling): Oh, yeah.

576
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,981
(Ricky and Pam roaring)

577
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,883
(Ricky and Pam grunting)

578
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,318
>> ARCHER: Yeah, good, okay.

579
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,386
'Cause this time, I may actually

580
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,387
murder Kenny Loggins.

581
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,388
>> PAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait,

582
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,389
wait!

583
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,356
>> ARCHER: What, Pam?!

584
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,658
>> PAM: First see if he wants

585
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,060
a beej.

586
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,667
(crashing, fighting)

587
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:39,735
>> ARCHER: Loggins! Loggins!

588
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,069
Now, look, before either of us

589
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,170
does something we'll both

590
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,205
regret, let's...

591
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:45,574
(gunshots)

592
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,410
Okay, that's just unacceptable.

593
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,611
Pam, I'm going in!

594
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,079
>> PAM: Okay!

595
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,748
(both grunting)

596
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,084
(Archer grunts)

597
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,385
(sniffing)

598
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,754
(coughs)

599
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,722
>> ARCHER: Oh, wow, he really

600
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:02,124
likes the Paco Rabanne.

601
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,125
(gasps)

602
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,459
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Tell Borgnar

603
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,628
I'll see him in hell!

604
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,432
>> ARCHER: Um, what the shit,

605
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,767
Loggins?!

606
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,703
(Kenny Loggins chuckles)

607
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:16,238
Wonder if it's too late

608
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,206
to get Messina.

609
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,108
Holy shit.

610
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,777
What kind of colossal idiot

611
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,278
would build a pool like that?

612
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,646
>> CHERLENE: I just want to go

613
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,747
on record as saying

614
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,149
that a glass swimming pool on

615
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,316
the penthouse balcony is,

616
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,251
without a doubt,

617
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,485
the absolute worst idea that

618
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,320
I have ever heard in my entire

619
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,256
goddamn life.

620
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,658
But you're the men, so...

621
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,093
>> ARCHER: (chuckles) But can

622
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:38,827
you imagine banging in

623
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,795
that thing?

624
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,663
Why, yes, Archer, yes, I can.

625
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:42,731
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Drop it!

626
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,632
(gun cocks)

627
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:44,833
Drop it on the ground.

628
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,101
>> ARCHER: Do you know how bad

629
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:46,802
that is for it?

630
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,236
I will place it on the ground,

631
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,070
but...

632
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,105
>> KENNY LOGGINS: You think

633
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:51,473
K-Log won't shoot, punk?

634
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,475
>> ARCHER: No, I think K-Log is

635
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,309
out of bullets.

636
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,243
>> KENNY LOGGINS: What?

637
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:55,744
(gun clicks)

638
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:56,745
How did you...

639
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:57,746
>> ARCHER: It's just a thing

640
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:58,747
I do.

641
00:14:58,749 --> 00:14:59,748
Now what the hell is in that

642
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,782
briefcase?

643
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,783
>> KENNY LOGGINS: As if you

644
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:02,784
don't know.

645
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,785
>> ARCHER: I honestly don't.

646
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:04,786
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Liar.

647
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:05,821
>> ARCHER: (chuckles) Look, I

648
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:06,855
put my weapon down, I'm not a

649
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,156
threat; how would I know what's

650
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,157
in...?

651
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,158
>> RICKY: Aah!

652
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
(Pam growling)

653
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,295
(Kenny Loggins grunts)

654
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:14,462
>> ARCHER: Pam, no, no, no, no,

655
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,463
no, don't, no, don't...

656
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,632
(gunshot)

657
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,700
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Shit.

658
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:19,935
>> ARCHER: Ooh, okay.

659
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,503
So one of...

660
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,838
(glass cracks)

661
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,173
One fairly predictable thing is

662
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,175
gonna happen now, so...

663
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,109
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Aah!

664
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,110
>> PAM and RICKY: Aah!

665
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,613
>> ARCHER: Loggins!

666
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,148
(Loggins grunts)

667
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,850
>> ARCHER: Ooh.

668
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,518
>> KENNY LOGGINS: (coughs) You

669
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,552
saved me.

670
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,553
But why?

671
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:39,654
>> ARCHER: What do you mean why?

672
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:40,689
(coughs)

673
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,690
I wanted you to play a baby

674
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,891
shower. (coughs)

675
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,492
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Wait, what?

676
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:45,493
>> ARCHER: The Dirty Diaper

677
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,494
game?

678
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:48,230
Water guns shaped like dicks?

679
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,331
A baby shower.

680
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,332
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Oh.

681
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:52,534
So, Borgnar? The briefcase?

682
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,535
>> ARCHER: I don't know anyone

683
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,536
named Borgnar.

684
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,570
And I don't want your crazy

685
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,571
briefcase.

686
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,572
What the hell is even in that

687
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:58,573
thing?

688
00:15:58,575 --> 00:15:59,574
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Don't worry

689
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,575
about it.

690
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:01,710
Just let it go.

691
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,744
>> ARCHER: I should let <i>you</i> go.

692
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:03,745
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Look, I'm...

693
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:04,746
you know...

694
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:05,814
>> ARCHER: Sorry?

695
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,215
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Mm, more just

696
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,316
embarrassed.

697
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:09,217
Is there some way I can make

698
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,218
this all up to you?

699
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,219
>> PAM: A beej!

700
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,220
>> ARCHER: Pam!

701
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,189
And no, Kenny Loggins, there's

702
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,257
no way to make up for almost

703
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,758
killing me over a briefcase

704
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,226
full of what I can only assume

705
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,195
is either plutonium or a human

706
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,696
soul.

707
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,598
(coughs) Although, that being

708
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
said...

709
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,269
>> CHERLENE: It's in D minor; do

710
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:28,436
you know what that is?

711
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,272
Or even what chords are?

712
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,740
>> KENNY LOGGINS: (sighs) Yes.

713
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,741
>> CHERLENE: Wow, snotty.

714
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,409
Okay, fine, so during the boring

715
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,410
parts, just scream "outlaw

716
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,411
country."

717
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,412
>> KENNY LOGGINS: Yeah,

718
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,448
absolutely not.

719
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,516
>> CHERLENE: ¶ Revvin' up your

720
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:43,418
engine, listen to her howlin'

721
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,419
roar... ¶

722
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,520
(Lana squeals)

723
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:46,521
Ugh!

724
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,023
>> ALL: Happy baby shower!

725
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,024
(cork pops)

726
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,392
>> LANA: Oh, my God, you guys.

727
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,459
>> KRIEGER: Me first, here!

728
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,794
It's a breast pump.

729
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:53,795
Go ahead and use it now if you

730
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:54,562
want.

731
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:56,231
>> LANA: I do not want, Krieger,

732
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,299
but thank you.

733
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:58,934
Aw, and thank you, Pam.

734
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,435
>> PAM: It's cocaine!

735
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,937
>> LANA: Oh, of course it is.

736
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,938
And also, what the hell

737
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,939
happened to you?

738
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,307
>> PAM: This big bastard.

739
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:06,308
>> LANA: What big...?

740
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,309
Whoa.

741
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:08,877
>> RICKY: Uh, hi.

742
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,712
Um, this is a car seat.

743
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:11,446
>> GILLETTE: Wha...

744
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,814
Goddamn it!

745
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:13,982
This whole stupid baby shower

746
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,884
was my idea! (sobbing)

747
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,319
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: ¶ Highway

748
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,555
to the danger zone

749
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:21,790
>> KENNY LOGGINS: ¶ I'll take

750
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,060
you right into the danger

751
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:26,928
zone... ¶

752
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,929
>> CYRIL: Here.

753
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,332
>> LANA: Oh, wow, a check.

754
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,933
For $80.

755
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,268
>> CYRIL: Please take me back.

756
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,337
>> LANA: Aw, Cyril.

757
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,338
Who's next?

758
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,472
>> MALORY: Well, I suppose me.

759
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,940
And all of this.

760
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:39,941
It's a layette.

761
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,509
Onesies, binkies,

762
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:42,944
itty bitty booties, blah blah

763
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:43,945
blah.

764
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,747
From baby Bergdorf's.

765
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,682
>> LANA: Oh, my God, it must've

766
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,683
been a fortune.

767
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:49,751
>> MALORY: Well, I can afford

768
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:50,752
it.

769
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,320
Apparently, Krieger's online

770
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,488
pharmacy is going gangbusters,

771
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,489
so...

772
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,091
>> WOODHOUSE: Pardon me, mum.

773
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,926
This was delivered for

774
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:58,927
Dr. Krieger.

775
00:17:58,929 --> 00:17:59,928
>> KRIEGER: What...?

776
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,029
Not now, you shriveled...

777
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:02,430
>> MALORY: Wait a minute.

778
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,798
That's the cocaine.

779
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,866
So this whole thing was just a

780
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:05,867
sham?

781
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:06,868
>> KRIEGER: Well, only if by

782
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,636
"sham" you mean "sham."

783
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,804
>> MALORY: (growls) Krieger!

784
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:10,805
>> KRIEGER: Aah! But you were

785
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:11,806
temporarily so happy!

786
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:12,807
>> CYRIL: Krieger, get back

787
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:13,708
here!

788
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,810
>> PAM: Yay!

789
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:16,878
>> KENNY LOGGINS: ¶ You'll never

790
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,381
say hello to you until you get

791
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:22,017
it on red line overload ¶

792
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,351
>> CHERLENE: ¶ You'll never know

793
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,387
what you can do until you get it

794
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,055
up as high as you can ¶

795
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,024
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: ¶ Go...

796
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,025
>> LANA: Wow.

797
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,459
This baby shower actually went

798
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:32,460
a lot better than I would've

799
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:33,461
imagined.

800
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,462
>> ARCHER: Right?

801
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:35,463
>> LANA: And what happened to

802
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:36,464
you?

803
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,699
>> ARCHER: Your present, Lana,

804
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,700
is what happened.

805
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,734
>> LANA: And it's...

806
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:40,568
where, exactly?

807
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,569
>> ARCHER: What, are you...

808
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:42,570
are you kidding?

809
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:43,571
It's...

810
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,572
>> WOODHOUSE: Right here, miss.

811
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:45,573
(Lana gasps)

812
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,574
>> ARCHER: Wha...

813
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:47,909
That's my crib!

814
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:50,078
Uh, which I want you to have for

815
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,679
the baby.

816
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,914
>> LANA: (gasps) Archer.

817
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,915
>> ARCHER: Because you're

818
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,517
important to me, so I made

819
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,352
Woodhouse get it from Mother's

820
00:18:57,354 --> 00:19:00,055
storage unit, because I own him.

821
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,389
>> LANA: Archer. (sniffles)

822
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,657
Archer, that is the sweetest

823
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:05,727
thing anybody has ever given me,

824
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,728
ever.

825
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,829
>> ARCHER: Well, yeah.

826
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,397
But, I mean, the big present,

827
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,666
obviously, is, uh...

828
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:13,935
"Danger Zone."

829
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,103
>> LANA: "Danger Zone."

830
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:16,538
>> ARCHER: The...

831
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,772
Lana, the song.

832
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,441
>> CHERLENE/LOGGINS: ¶ Highway

833
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:23,945
to the danger zone

834
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:32,787
Right into the danger zone...

835
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,091
Ooh... ¶

836
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,125
>> LANA: Oh.

837
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,860
Oh, okay.

838
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,195
>> ARCHER: "Danger Zone," Lana.

839
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:42,530
You know, how I'm always saying

840
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:44,032
"danger zone"?

841
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,800
>> LANA: Uh, kinda?

842
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:46,868
Yes?

843
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,869
>> ARCHER: Well...

844
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:48,870
>> LANA: It's from a song?

845
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:49,871
>> ARCHER: Yes, it's from a

846
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:50,872
song!

847
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,540
Recorded by Grammy winner and

848
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,142
possible Faustian bargain-maker

849
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:56,077
Kenny goddamn Loggins!

850
