- [all gasp]
- Five minutes is up. Let's go!

161
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,493
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Ugh, wasn't done!

162
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:07,798
Hmm? Infiltrated the enemy, huh?

163
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,300
The what?

164
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:12,303
Enema! Just talking about
enemas, and, uh,

165
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,372
how clean and fresh they make you feel.

166
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:15,802
I mean, not you, per se, but people,

167
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:16,987
ya know, in general, I guess.

168
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,421
And kids, also, maybe. I don't know

169
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,677
what kids are into these days.

170
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,012
Are whippits still a thing? Point is...

171
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,748
shitter's clogged!

172
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,529
<i>[Archer] Okay, so</i>

173
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:39,066
first I need to
stash the Tsarina, which...

174
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,767
[shivering] ha-ha, ho-ho-ho...

175
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,036
don't know what I was expecting.

176
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,938
Okay, now to see if I can override
the security system

177
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,740
and get those steel doors open.

178
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,709
Okay, okay, so, then, let
me throw this out there

179
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:52,913
and see if the cat licks
it up: we cut the power.

180
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,381
- To the house...
- Zerp!

181
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,217
And, by extension, then,
the steel doors.

182
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,721
Oh, right. They are electric.

183
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:02,054
Yeah, so do you and kitty wanna lick me

184
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,289
through how that's supposed to work?

185
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,224
And so, now, what was your idea?

186
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,728
Two squads of six, breach formation,

187
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,512
shape charges on steel
doors here and here,

188
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:10,096
[beeping]

189
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,965
detonate, ingress, take out hostiles

190
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:15,469
with flash-bangs, and/or beanbags,

191
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,176
secure the friendlies, achieve

192
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,906
egress, drop mic. We're out.

193
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,174
Yeah. The second you blow the doors,

194
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,308
they're gonna execute everybody.

195
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,235
Which is the tactical equivalent of

196
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,077
a cat puking on your duvet cover.

197
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,247
Come on. Let's go. Here we
go. Move it, move it, move it.

198
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,284
Let's go, ladies. Move it,
move it, move it. Let's go!

199
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:34,421
Hang on. I got a big old wad of
toilet paper stuck on my shoe.

200
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:36,123
- Ugh!
- Seriously.

201
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:39,292
And I really need to check
in with my babysitter, so...

202
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,094
- Typical.
- Shut up.

203
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:42,796
Make me. Ow!

204
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,464
Hey, knock it off, you two!

205
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:46,297
- [slap lands]
- Damn it! I said knock it off!

206
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,634
- [Cheryl] Make me. Ow!
- [slap lands]

207
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,670
Okay! Jesus!

208
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,105
Ooh! Looks so good!

209
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:54,141
- Well...
- [bones cracking]

210
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:56,944
hope I'm not allergic to clown blood.

211
00:08:56,977 --> 00:09:00,113
- S'up, ding-dong?
- Wh... Why the hell are you in here?

212
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:03,650
I heard you were getting your ass beat.

213
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,618
- [beeping]
- Oh, for the...

214
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,787
What is this, NORAD?

215
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,656
- Damn it. You'd have to be, like...
- [snaps fingers]

216
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:10,824
Ray!

217
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:12,291
Hang on. I had something for...

218
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:15,128
Was it Ain't-Two-Dee-Two?

219
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:17,031
Eh...

220
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:20,367
- Okay, so, if you're right...
- Which...

221
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,636
Merely for the sake of
argument, let's say you are,

222
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,471
and Archer has infiltrated these guys...

223
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,806
We have to find out which one is him.

224
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,007
Which...

225
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,542
Ow! Hey, cut it out.

226
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,210
Ow! Come... Ow! Damn it! Come on!

227
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:33,880
That's... Ow! Okay! Ow!

228
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,065
What is he doing? Sterling's got the

229
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,984
rest of his life to slap Cyril.

230
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,987
- No! No!
- [whistles] Excuse me.

231
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,689
- Okay! Stop! Ow! Ow!
- Excuse me, green one?

232
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,491
She needs the bathroom again.

233
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:46,192
You just went!

234
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,828
- I know, but...
- She has diarrhea!

235
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:49,663
Ugh!

236
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:50,998
Seriously.

237
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,699
- Ya know...
- What? You were the one

238
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:55,068
shoving pizza in your
gob like it owed you money.

239
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,336
- Doesn't even makes sense.
- [frustrated yelling]

240
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,873
Giggles, go with her.

241
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,508
Yes, you! Idiot!

242
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,011
Psst!

243
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,380
[singsongy] Ready when you are.

244
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:07,380
Blech.

245
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,348
Seriously.

246
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,885
Did you see that? Malory
just winked at that guy.

247
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,687
- Do you think she's in on the caper?
- Or just giving him props

248
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,589
for slapping the dog piss outta Cyril.

249
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,903
Yeah, that does make more sense.

250
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,928
But either way, not cool.

251
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,696

Stay cold, Pony Boy. [laughs]

253
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,868
Eh...

254
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,036
Okay, now I just gotta find Archer.

255
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,605
- What?
- I said, here is good.

256
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,073
- So go ahead.
- Huh?

257
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:35,876
Okay. How about for starters,

258
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:39,111
- "I'm sorry I kissed that old woman"?
- Mm, okay.

259
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:41,065
"I don't know what got
into me. I can only assume

260
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,749
it was my repressed desire to
sleep with my own mother."

261
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:44,884
Uh... [chuckles]

262
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,552
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Wow!

263
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:49,388
So this is all just a
big joke to you, huh?

264
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,959
Meanwhile, I guess we get killed
by a bunch of clowns,

265
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:53,961
and A.J. gets to go
live in an orphanage!

266
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,384
Well, if we live through this, we

267
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:56,897
are gonna have a long talk, Archer.

268
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,732
- Who?
- [imitating Giggles] "Who"?

269

[guffaws] Quit dicking around.

270
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,402
I know you took out the
green clown, and... and...

besides ruining that dress,

291
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,063
is now I have to have that exact same

stupid argument all over
again with Archer!

293

294
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,294
one of these scrote-licks is him.

295

And then I am gonna let him have it!

296
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,166
And then, boom, we're outta here.

297
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:08,301

[imitating Veronica] "Archer,
you saved me and the Tsarina!"

299

And then she swoons, and I catch

300
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,308
her, and there is a moment, and...

301
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:19,880
Honestly, I don't see what
could possibly go wrong.

302

Look, we're running out of time here.

303
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,096
Those perps gotta be panicking by now,

304
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,533
and panic equals dead hostages.

305
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,085
Yeah, well, so does barging in there

306
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,604
with shape charges and flash-bangs.

307

Okay. Okay. So, then, I'm gonna

just throw this out there,

00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,286
I didn't. You just told me.

478
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,520
Oh, damn it!

479
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,190
Yeah. Not great. For you.

480
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,959
I mean, when Veronica
finds out you did this.

481
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,460
<i>I did it for her.</i>

482
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:35,995
- [laughs]
- She's broke.

483
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:38,498
My God, she's got all
these bills to pay...

484
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,666
health insurance, a huge mortgage...

485
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,634
She can't eat a bunch of
diamonds and emeralds.

486
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,187
So you hired those clowns to steal

487
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,706
it, to get the insurance money...

488
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:47,873
Old clients of mine.
I got 'em out of jail,

489
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:50,008
but then they double-cross me.

490
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,046
- And now I bet they're gonna kill me!
- Yeah, probably.

491
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,514
So, the Tsarina is worth...

492
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,483
I mean, like, four million.

493
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,686
And you were gonna pay the
clowns, so you didn't have to worry

494
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,187
about the cops or the insurance company?

495
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:04,824
Like, a s... four hundred grand?

496
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,493
Yeah. So, I'm gonna
need a half a million in...

497
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:10,229
- I don't know. Have you got Krugerrands?
- I mean...

498
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,998
- yeah.
- Super. So, that.

499
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,066
And then, if you hear from
Rompers and his gang...

500
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,002
- Which...
- you let me know.

501
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:19,238
- I owe him one.
- So, you'll protect me?

502
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:21,173
No. I'll protect Veronica Deane.

503
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:24,544
- [coins jingling]
- Oh, so, did she ask about me, or...

504
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:28,213
Did she... [laughing]

505
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,682
Oh, Mr....

506
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,886
[laughing continues]

507
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,554
She...

508
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:35,587
[sighs]

509
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:39,258
Whew! No.

510
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,881
There's a nice way to do that.

511
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:45,864
