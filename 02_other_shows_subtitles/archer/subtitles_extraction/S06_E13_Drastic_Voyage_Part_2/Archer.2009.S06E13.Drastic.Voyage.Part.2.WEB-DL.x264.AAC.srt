00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,340
So yeah,
we shower it up,

457
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,841
And then wherever
the town is,

458
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,877
We go find a sizzler
or whatever--

459
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,913
Me, lana,
you and tv's michael gray,
double-date--

460
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:33,151
And the flrrp-- get shitty
on rib eyes and scotch.
Mmkay.

461

463
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,423
Oh, that's it.

468
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,999
[screaming]

469
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,845
Huh.

470
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,914
Guess we didn't make it...

471
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,250
But-- so,
is there a steakhouse around?

472
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,586
Oh, and do they have
flowerpot bread?

473
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,124
All right,
so now listen--

474
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,060
No, no, no, no,
I will not listen,

475
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,795
Because you no longer
exist in my world.

476
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,797
So take this unlucky baby...

477
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,267
While I focus on the two
positive aspects
of this debacle,

478
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,803
The first being
that you people
will no longer be a stain

479
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,206
On the escutcheon
of the clandestine services,
and--

480
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,108
No, please!
You can't blacklist us.

481
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,210
This is all
I've ever known, it's--
shh!

482
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,813
The second positive
is that even though
dr. Kovacs is dead,

483
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,882
His miniaturization
process lives on

484
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,584
In the memory banks
of the supercomputer--

485
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,385
[smashing]

486
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,300
Woo!
Shrinky-dink that!

487
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,502
Krieger out!

488
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,305
Which...
[alarm buzzing]

489
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,308
Dr. Kovacs
conceived and built

490
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,478
The magnum opus
of what was surely
the greatest mind

491
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,847
Of his generation.

492
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,483
[alarm continuing]

493
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,586
And so you work your
whole life for something,
for a cause,

494
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,122
And in the end
what do you have
to show for it?

495
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,925
No parade, no statue,
no medal of freedom,

496
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,493
No songs of heroic deeds...

497
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,128
[coos]

498
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,098
Just an ulcer
and you, dear...
[coos]

499
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,234
Who I honestly think
just gave me a hernia.

500
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,238
[car honks]

501
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,377
[flies buzzing]

502
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,813
Well, if you fed her,
like you said you did,

503
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,348
Why is she still
hungry?

504
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,351
Who knows with her?
A tapeworm?

505
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,289
And after that disaster,
you'd all better get used
to being hungry.

506
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,057
At least until
I can find a way

507
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,992
To get us back
in with the cia.

508
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,128
Why bother?
Excuse me?

509
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,298
Well, look,
I can't speak for archer--
and yet--

510
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,500
But I don't want
to risk my life
on shady missions

511
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,235
For those assholes
at the cia.

512
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,003
I have a child to raise.

513
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,505
So do I!
Well, not...

514
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,540
And besides,
they obviously
set us up.

515
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,876
They've always
wanted us to fail.
Why would they--

516
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:16,314
Why would you wanna work
for those ivy league
white-shoe d.C. Pricks?

517
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,815
[everyone agrees]

518
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,150
That's not who we are!

519
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:22,053
We're the outsiders,
the scrappy underdogs!

520
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,921
[everyone agrees]

521
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,057
We're delta house,
the dirty dozen,

522
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,492
The rebel alliance,
the commitments!

523
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,328
[together]
yeah!
Woo-hoo!

524
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,830
We're the bad news
frickin' bears,

525
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,499
And our lupus
is an openly gay cyborg

526
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,568
Dying of sepsis
in a wheelbarrow!

527
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,538
[everyone]
woo!
That's us!

528
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
[krieger]
I do think he's actually
dying, though.

529
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,443
So why would you want
to go back to being
the cia's--

530
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,545
Sorry, but-- bitch?

531
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,280
Because, you peawit,

532
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,349
What are we going
to do for money?

533
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,451
Well...

534
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,187
I actually have
some thoughts on that.

535
