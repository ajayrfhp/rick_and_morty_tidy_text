And he had
a good, long life.

18
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,156
He did, for a heroin addict.

could be another three months.

Could be...
Yeah.

00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,083
Well, I guess I'll go.

32
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,584
I'll try to bring
a.J. By tomorrow.

Or Friday.

34

We'll be here.

35
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,457
At least he doesn't know
woodhouse died.

36
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,093
That would break his heart.
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,196
Although there's no telling
what he knows.

38
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,598
Or what he's thinking about.

39

Well, dreaming about,
i suppose.

Come on!

47
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,267
Go easy, Archer.
Poovey, I swear to Christ,

48
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,502
I will punch you
right in the... genitals.

It's okay. Let him go.
You big lummox.

Oh, Jesus. Woodhouse.

51
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,677
So, where are you, figgis?

52
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,145
You got any leads?
What do you think happened?

53
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,614
I think he got too far
behind on his dope tab,

54
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,049
so sometime last night
his dealer

55
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,184
punched his ticket for him.

56
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,386
Yeah, and wouldn't that
be convenient?

57
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,687

Not for him.

Now, scram, Archer!

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,060
Ow. Son of a--
i mean, just ow.

61
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,695
You can claim the body
at the morgue.

62
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,497
But that better be
the last time I smell you

63
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,898
anywhere near this case.

64
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah, we'll see about that.

65
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,734
Yeah? And we'll see
how you like it

66
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,403
when I yank
your p.I. License.

67
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,672
(Sighs)
See you around, poovey.

68
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,839
Take it easy, Archer.

69
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,374
Oh, hey, and Archer?

70
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,410
Come to think of it,
where were you last night?

71
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,811
Ask your wife.
(Growls)

72
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,047
Ah, you know his wife left him.

73
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,481
For you, Archer,

74
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,817
'cause you screwed her tits off
at the precinct cookout.

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,852
So then she thought the two
of you would get married

76
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,223
and live happily ever after,
but then you were like, "what?"

77
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,592
Exactly. That face
right there.

78
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,394
I-- (Groans)

79
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,196
How does that help?

80
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,665
Mm, humanizes you?

81
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,870
(Whistling)

82
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,239
Hey, pal. You got a second?

83
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,574
I do not, actually,
and I am not,

84
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,043
come to think
of it, so screw.

85
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,879
Hm. I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase that.
What--?

86
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,748
Do you know who I work for?

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,783
Do you know how much
i don't care?

88
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,385
About what?
Living out the week?

89
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,287
'Cause we're both
out of luck, friend.

90
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,189
I left all my cash
at the track.

91
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,258
But if maybe you wanted
some dope...?

92
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,592
Do I look like
a junkie to you?

93
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,194
I don't know.
I try not to judge.

94
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,762
You used to sell
to this guy.

95
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,530
Yeah, woodhouse. He--

96
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,765
wait. Used to?

97
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,734
He's dead.
What?

98
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,968
Oh, for the love of--

99
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,971
he was one of--
no, he was my best customer.

100
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,706
So, he was paid up?

101
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,875
Paid up? He paid in advance.

102
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,877
Yeah. He was not great
with money.

103
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,313
(Chuckling) Right? I mean, who
tips their dope dealer?

104
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,048
So, I guess we're done here?

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,616
We're done when I say
we're done.

106
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,951
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,120

Okay.

is gonna happen here.

111

Oh!
(Clatter)

112
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,463

the other thing was?

(Growls)

116
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,441
I wish you wouldn't
antagonize him.

No, it wasn't.

00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,285

No, thank you, zerk,
that will suffice.

122
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,920
(Zerk growls)
Huh?

123
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,954
Wha-- what's-- what--

124
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,990
ah, there he is.

125
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,826
The infamous Sterling Archer,
private eye.

126
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,695
And I trust you know
who I am?

127
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,631
I do. But what do I call you?

128
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,666
Mother will do.

129
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,170
And so, you do know who I am,
but you don't care?

130
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,371
What? No, i--

131
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,806
that's what you told
my bartender

132
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,808
when you stuck a gun
in his ribs.

133
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,109
I-- well, first of all,

134
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,644
your bartender sells heroin.

135
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,979
Gasp.
And I pulled my gun

136
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,649
because I'm trying to find out
who killed my partner.

137
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,217
That would be woodhouse.

138
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,019
Yeah. He-- how'd
you know that?

139
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,456
It's my business to know a great
many things, Mr. Archer.

140
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,524
What would you say
if I offered you a drink?

141
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,992
I'd probably say bourbon.

142
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,327
Old buncombe,
if you've got it.

143
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,496
Oh, I have a bit
of everything.

144
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,064
So I hear.
Hmm.

145
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,367
How do you take it?
Usually alone.

146
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,502
Thank you for making
an exception.

147
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,970
Please.

148
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,078
And so, I do hope you'll
forgive Mr. zerk

149
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,215
for his hands-on approach.
Maybe.

150
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,549
But I sure won't forget it.

151
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,718
Yes. I believe that
was the point.

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,087
I meant--
i know what you meant.

153
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,355
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

154
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,190
Never took it up.
Really?

155
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,526
But I thought they loaded
all you g.I.S down

156
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,928
with cartons of them
on your way up the gangplank.

157
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,731
They did.
Supposed to help
keep you alert.

158
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,367
I guess I found it all
stimulating enough.

159
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,903
Hm. Normandy?
Yeah.

160
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,271
Omaha beach.

161
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,707
By way of north Africa
and sicily.

162
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,176
And after normandy,
through France and Belgium,

163
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,544
all the way to Berlin.

164
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,079
Well, I had to get to Berlin.

165
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,181
I'd sent
all my clean shirts ahead.

166
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,450
Mm-hmm. Speak any German?

167
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,685
You know. "Don't shoot,"
"i surrender,"

168
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,255
"Hitler's the tops,"
stuff like that.
Mm-hmm.

169
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,358
Bronze star with two oak leaves
and "v" device.

170
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,528
Legion of merit.
Croix de guerre with palm.

171
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,696
Silver star with two oak leaves.

172
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,964
Distinguished service cross

173
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,033
with one oak leaf
and "v" device.

174
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,703
Three purple hearts.
It goes on, Mr. Archer.

175
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,072
Yeah, senior year,
i was voted class flirt.

176
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,275
And yet, you turned down
a battlefield commission

177
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,643
to second lieutenant.

178
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,211
Well, after class flirt,
i mean--

179
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,581
in fact, you left the army
at the same rank you went in.

180
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,484
Buck private. And do you know
what that tells me?

181
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,286
I need a new lock
on my diary?

182
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,221
That you don't like
taking orders.

183
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,290
Yeah, or having
my time wasted.

184
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,491
So, if you'll excuse me--

185
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,593
oh, no. I will not.

186
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,594
Excuse me?
No.

187
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,162
I just said.
Sorry?

188
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,064
Me too.
I-- wait. No. I meant--

189
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,499
I know what you meant.

190
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,501
I-- look, I'm just trying
to find the bastard

191
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,071
who killed my partner.
With which, perhaps,
i can help you.

192
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,307
With which-- hang on.
Wait, really?

193
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,809
Perhaps. But before i
could help you,

194
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,744
I would need you
to help me.

195
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,113
I'll do anything to find
woodhouse's killer.

196
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,582
And then avenge his death.

197
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,016
Well then, Mr. Archer,

198
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,452
what would you say if i
offered you a job?

199
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,288
I'd probably say yes.

200
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,756
And also bourbon.

201
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,662
Mother: Len trexler.

202
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,431
I assume you're familiar
with him?

203
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,932
Archer: (Chuckling)
Who isn't?

204
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,767
He's the biggest mobster
in L.A.

205
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,836
Well, maybe not
for much longer.

206
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,837
Why, is he sick?

207
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,839
Wh-- no, you ass.

208
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,475
Although you could say
that his time has come.

209
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,377
Wait. You want me
to help you make a move

210
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,778
against len trexler?

211
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,214
Whose hobby is dissolving
people in acid?

212
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:40,051
Oh, now, trexler doesn't do
the actual dissolving.

213
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,153
That would be
his enforcer, Dutch Dylan.

214
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,523
I don't care who
does the dissolving.

215
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,958
But if you help me,
i can help you.

216
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,661
Perhaps. You made that
very clear.

217
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,162
Look, all I need you to do

218
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,465
is go down to pier 9
in long beach tonight

219
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,001
and simply observe
and report back.

220
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,636
No.
Oh, come on.

221
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,371
I thought you had guts.

222
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,373
And I'd like to keep them
in their current location,

223
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,010
I.E., inside me, not melting
in a 50-gallon drum of acid

224
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,345
with my shoes and feet
and face.

225
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,982
¶<i> Never know how much</i>
<i> I love you</i> ¶

226
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:15,020
¶<i> never know how much I care</i> ¶

227
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,256
¶<i> when you put your arms</i>
<i> around me</i> ¶

228
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:21,259
¶<i> I get a fever that's</i>
<i> so hard to bear</i> ¶

229
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,230
¶<i> you give me fever</i> ¶

230
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,098
¶<i> when you kiss me</i> ¶

231
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,569
¶<i> fever when you</i>
<i> hold me tight</i> ¶

232
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:35,006
¶<i> fever in the morning</i> ¶

233
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,509
¶<i> fever all through</i>

234
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,744
¶<i> you give me fever</i> ¶

235
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,613
I'm in.
Excellent.

236
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:46,051
Then find killer,
uh, revenge do.

237
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,852
Careful what you wish for.

238
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,588
You just might get it.

239
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,256
¶<i> Till you sizzle</i> ¶

240
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,359
¶<i> what a lovely way</i> ¶

241
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,661
¶<i> to burn</i> ¶

242
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,467
that's some set
you got on you.

243
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,135
I mean, not your-- i--

244
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,305
I meant--
i know what you meant.

245
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,808
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me start over.

246
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,743
My name's Archer.

247
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,978
Lana Kane.

248
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,614
And, I'm sorry,
but have we met?

249
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,649
If we had, you'd remember.

250
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,317
(Rimshot)
Gillette: Stop it.

251
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,621
And so, um, you're
the singer here.

252
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:26,291
Wow. And you must be
an old gypsy woman.

253
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,426
Close. I'm a private
investigator.

254
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,595
I'm doing some work
for your boss.

255
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,498
And apparently doing it
with a fresh new take

256
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,133
on the word "private."

257
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,603
Can I buy you a drink?

258
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,271
Hmm. Bottle of pbr.

259
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,973
(Chuckling)
Pbr. Wow.

260
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,842
I-i would have
thought your tastes

261
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,177
were a little more, um--

262
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,846
Pierre beauvais. Rouge.

263
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,447
Ah.
Problem?

264
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,750
No. Not-not when you're
pulling down

265
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,352
25 bucks a day
plus expenses.

266
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,588
And what sort of
daily expenses

267
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,090
does a semi-private
investigator incur?

268
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,526
Bullets?
Daily.

269
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,162
Or, I don't know,
maybe a surf-and-turf dinner

270
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,964
at the Polo lounge?
Un-huh.

271
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,100
And then maybe a room upstairs,
at the Beverly hills hotel.

272
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,636
Uh-huh.
And then, maybe--

273
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,605
I'm gonna leave you here.

274
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,741
Between hope and despair.

275
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,211
What the hell does that mean?

276
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,447
Before you shoot a big,
salty load in your pants.

277
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,516
Shut up. How much
for the champagne?

278
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,518
$26.

279
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,853
Wha-- I'm not paying 26 bucks

280
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,357
for a bottle of frustration.
(Growls)

281
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,726
(Groans)
You're lucky my ear hurts.

282
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,662
There.
Plus tip.

283
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,699
How about the tip of my cock?
(Rimshot)

284
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,667
Gillette: Stop it!
So, in that scenario,

285
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,804
would I take your penis
in my hand? My mouth?

286
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:50,275
Asshole. Wait, no.
I mean-- not-- goddammit.

287
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,679
Archer:
Pierre beauvais Rouge.

288
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,181
Hardy har har.

289
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,916
Hey, 1933 called.

290
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,884
They want
their gold digger back.

291
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,520
Meanwhile, I have to dip
into my rainy day fund,

292
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:07,492
which is barely enough to buy
an extremely nice umbrella.

293
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,028
Wait. What the--

294
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,596
holy shit.

295
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,932
Leave it to woodhouse.

296
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,601
Now I can find his killer
and take revenge.

297
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,403
Although... I better get moving

298
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,505
if I'm going to make it
to long beach in time.

299
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,775
Okay. So, first thing
tomorrow morning.

300
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,544
Well, or probably
after breakfast.

301
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,713
After which, I just remembered
I'm getting a haircut.

302
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,582
But after that,

303
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,017
vengeance will be mine.

304
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,419
Oh, duh.

305
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,555
Just like you always
said, woodhouse,

306
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,358
"lock the safe, Archer,
you dumb twat."

307
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,930
<i> I wanted to get mixed up</i>
<i> with mobsters</i>

308
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,466
<i> like mother and len trexler</i>
<i> about as much as I wanted</i>

309
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,368
<i> a new hole in my head.</i>

310
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,403
But I meant it when I said
I'd do anything

311
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,072
to find woodhouse's killer.

312
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,707
Although, truth be told,

313
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,244
I'd also do anything
just to see Lana Kane again.

314
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,814
So here I am, headed straight
into the belly of the beast.

315
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,483
Nothing between me and death
but my wits

316
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,119
and the cold, blue steel
of my .45.

317
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,222
(Chuckles) I have no idea why
I'm telling you all this.

318
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,391
Or why I picked you up.

319
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,727
I don't even know
where you're going.
(Whines)

320
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,829
Hopefully long beach.
(Barks)

321
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,998
Well, too bad.

322
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,281
(Whispering): Because I don't
need a spirit animal,

323
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,117
and if I did,
he'd be an ocelot.

324
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,319
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

325
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,690
Okay. Observe and report.

326
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,660
So easy, even a cop
could-- wait.

327
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,761
What the--

328
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,201
hm. Now, what's a nice,
unmarked LAPD girl like you

329
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,937
doing in a place like this?
(Engine approaches)

330
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,380
So, what's trexler importing?

331
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,684
Some new, improved
people-melting acid?

332
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,154
Dammit, they're in defilade,
i can't see what they're doing.

333
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,323
(Sighs)
I gotta get higher.

334
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,691
That ought to do.

335
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,533
(Sniffs)

336
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,176
Now, that is a lovely
parting gift.

337
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,578
And who's our lucky
contestant, Bob?

338
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,482
Come on, you bent prick,
look up.

339
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,050
Dammit.

340
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,819
Man:
Come on, move it.

341
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,188
Archer: Huh.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

342
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,156
Guess trexler's not opening
a Chinese restaurant.

343
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,325
I mean, in this economy?

344
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,060
A whorehouse, though,

345
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,996
bet that's pretty much
recession-proof.

346
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,731
Move, goddammit.
(Cries out)

347
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,332
(Archer gasps)

348
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,434
(Panting)

349
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,503
Okay, Archer, just stay calm.

350
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,771
Yeah, good advice.

351
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,340
Ow!
Oh. Still tender, huh?

352
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,775
What the hell are you
doing here?

353
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,210
Asking you the same thing.

354
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,878
None of your damn business.

355
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,546
Everything is my business.

356
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,917
Oh. Including white slavery?
Yes, incl-- wait. What?

357
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,185
Those girls are
tied up, asshole.

358
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,587
No, they're not,
they're just--

359
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,555
ah, dog dicks.

360
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,725
Yeah, so--
but wouldn't it be
yellow slavery?

361
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,128
(Scoffs)
Wh-- I don't know, racist.

362
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,697
White slavery's just as racist.
What?

363
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,465
No. You know, if you
differentiate between,

364
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,234
like,
cotton-picking slavery--

365
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,870
Jesus Christ.
...And then white slavery,
that's--

366
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,805
sexual slavery, then.
Okay.

367
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,440
Archer: Goddammit.
(Engine starts)

368
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,108
My point is I think we're
both anti-slavery.

369
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,244
Yeah, you're a regular
granville sharp.

370
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,612
But since I'm guessing
that was

371
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,913
your boss taking
the payoff--

372
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,082
but he didn't know
about this part.

373
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,651
Or any part,
'cause he wasn't here.

374
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,486
Wow. Well, I'm sold.

375
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,989
Really?
No, dickhead.

376
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,124
And neither are they.
Whoa. Look,

377
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,393
I don't know what the hell you
think you're gonna do.

378
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,228
Well then, that makes
two of us.
What are you--

379
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,798
oof.

380
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,966
Well?

381
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,534
Goddammit.

382
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,104
Son of a bitch!

383
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,405
(Grunts)

384
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,341
(Sighs)
I mean...

385
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,777
So, funny story.

386
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,312
Jesus, it's the cop, poovey.

387
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,947
So, yeah. So--

388
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,249
(screaming)

389
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,419
(Grunting)

390
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,833
(Panting)

391
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,368
(Sniffs)
Okay.

392
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,703
One of two things is gonna--
(Gunshots)

393
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,139
Wh- what--

394
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,141
what?
...The shit?

395
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,677
They knew me from work.

396
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,814
Ugh.
What? You think they
heard that?

397
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,017
Because, just so i
understand you,

398
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,552
your theory is
the truck backfired,

399
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,722
whereas your theory
is fireworks.

400
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,723
They are Chinese.

401
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,159
What in Christ foo Yung

402
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,328
could they possibly
be celebrating?

403
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,864
Who knows? They got
their own calendar.

404
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,499
(Sighs)
Go back there,

405
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,901
you team of oxen, and--
(Door opens)

406
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,669
Can I help you?

407
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,005
Out of the truck.
(Chuckles)

408
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,707
Do you know whose truck
this is?

409
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,676
Do you know how much
i don't care?

410
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,845
That's cute.
No, seriously.

411
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,147
You're making a--
(Grunts)

412
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,716
...huge mistake. Huge!

413
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,152
Do you hear me?
Yes. We're right here.

414
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,987
Well, you better just kill me.

415
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,523
That's--
(Clears throat, deeper)
That's what I said.

416
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,993
Because when, not if,
i find out who you are,

417
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,095
I'm going to liquefy you.

418
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,865
Okay.
Same goes
for those Chinese whores.

419
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,867
So I'm serious.
You better kill me.

420
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,670
So, you're saying when I drive
this truck out of here,

421
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,206
you'd prefer I drove over your
head, not your ankles.

422
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,341
Wait, what?
No, no.

423
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,243
No, I meant--
i know what you meant.

424
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,915
(Screaming)

425
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,616
(Crying)

426
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,689
What?

427
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,157
Nothing.

428
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,528
I mean, I feel like i
already know the answer,

429
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,530
but are you crazy?

430
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,299
How are they my responsibility?

431
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,767
Because your crooked boss

432
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,569
took a payoff to let them
off that boat.

433
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,070
What am I supposed
to do with them?

434
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,538
Get 'em jobs.

435
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,474
There are plenty of Chinese
restaurants, laundries--

436
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,708
now who's racist?

437
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,743
No. Because those are places

438
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,812
where other Chinese people
already work.

439
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,781
They don't speak
English, dumbass.

440
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,250
I do little bit.
Then shut up.

441
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,919
(Gasps)
I'm so sorry.

442
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,588
I can't even imagine
the day you've had.

443
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,889
God, the week.

444
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,424
The life.
(Chuckling)
Shut up.

445
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,794
Seriously.
Sorry about the laundry thing.

446
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,896
You're doing this,
end of story.
I--

447
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:55,266
a story in which
a Los Angeles police detective

448
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,934
murdered three people.

449
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,437
(Sighs)
Dick.

450
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:03,274
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

451
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,609
(Sighs)
Super.

452
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,445
Now I get to go report
what I observed.

453
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,147
Then drove a truck over.

454
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,917
So, first, maybe a drink.

455
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,585
Or 12.

456
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,355
Goddammit!

457
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,358
Goddammit.

458
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,261
Goddammit!

459
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,498
(Phone rings)

460
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,367
Who the hell is this?

461
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,935
Mother:<i> Guess. </i>
(Gulps)

462
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,338
I-i was just coming
to see you.

463
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,174
<i> Oh, goody.</i>

464
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,177
Because I am just
on pins and needles--
<i> well--</i>

465
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,812
...to hear how you turned a
stakeout into three dead,

466
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,383
one crippled, and len trexler
ready to go to war.

467
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,951
<i> How do you already</i>
<i> know that?</i>

468
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,554
And I swear to god,
I've got half a mind

469
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,656
to just kill you myself.
<i> I--</i>

470
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:55,660
but the other half says you're
slightly more use to me alive.

471
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,994
<i> If--</i>
for now.

472
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,530
I--
<i> because now you owe me.</i>

473
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,300
<i> My office, Archer.</i>
<i> First thing tomorrow morning.</i>

474
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,401
<i> (Dial tone)</i>

475
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,971
(Sighs)

476
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,239
Ahem.

477
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,475
