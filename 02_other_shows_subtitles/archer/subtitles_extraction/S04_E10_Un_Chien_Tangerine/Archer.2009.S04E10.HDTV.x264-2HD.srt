1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,958
LOUDSPEAKER: Allaaaaaaaahu akbaaaaaaaaaar...
LANA (O.S.): Noooo...

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:10,463
LANA: Ugh, no wonder Morocco Mole was
so inept, he never got any damn sleep.

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:11,764
[brrrrrpt]

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,153
LANA: Unlike some people!

5
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:16,007
ARCHER: Wuzzat?! Oh. G'morning.

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,575
LANA: Don't "g'morning" me!

7
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:18,810
ARCHER: What's your problem?

8
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,078
LANA: Besides that
frickin air raid siren?

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,915
ARCHER: It's the muezzin
chanting the adhan, Lana. God,

10
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,316
be open to other cultures.

11
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,586
LANA: I am! What I'm not open
to is not sleeping on the

12
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:31,589
floor, listening to your drunk
ass fart and snore all night in

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,026
the only bed, which I'm sure
is why you wanted this room!

14
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:37,028
ARCHER: If I may rebut,
point by point?

15
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:37,729
LANA: No, you may -

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,228
ARCHER: A, pretty sure I offered
to share the bed, B, I

17
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,434
wasn't that drunk...
LANA: Really.

18
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:45,503
ARCHER: Lana, this is me we're talking about.
And okay yeah,

19
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,239
maybe I smoked just a teeny bit
too much hashish, but that's

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,174
only because I didn't
want to be rude.

21
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,045
LANA: To who, the creepy old Moroccan dude?
Or those Dutch high school girls?

22
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:57,582
ARCHER: Both, the latter of
whom were college juniors, and

23
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,986
C, Lana we had to take this room,
Beat history was made here!

24
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:03,287
LANA: Says who, the manager?!

25
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:05,289
ARCHER: Wh-? Why would he lie?!

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,858
HOTEL MANAGER: You
are American, yes?

27
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,992
ARCHER: Uh, yes?

28
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,861
HOTEL MANAGER: Then you know
Allen Ginsberg, author of the

29
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:13,030
poem Howl, "I saw the best
minds of my generation

30
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:17,569
destroyed by madness,
starving hysterical naked..."

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,970
ARCHER: Yes.

32
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:21,205
HOTEL MANAGER: So for extra one
thousand American, you can

33
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,874
have room where he wrote-
ARCHER: Yes!

34
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,976
LANA: Archer, Morocco.

35
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:28,813
ARCHER: Yeah, hang on. Is this really the
room where Allen Ginsberg wrote Howl?

36
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:31,148
HOTEL MANAGER: Why not.

37
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:35,252
ARCHER: Yeah why not? And just
so we're clear, you're mad at

38
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:38,756
all that stuff, and not just being
weird because we had sex last night.

39
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:40,525
LANA: Are you -- we
didn't have sex!

40
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:45,663
ARCHER: Good, because I lied, I was drunk.
Want some? Make ya feel better.

41
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,065
LANA: What will make me feel
better, is to get out of shit-

42
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,802
reeking Tangier, which we can
only do after we extract -

43
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,138
agent what's his name, Kazak -
who, why the hell hasn't he

44
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,908
activated his GPS beacon, and
while we're on the subject,

45
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,910
where the hell is our GPS?

46
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,212
ARCHER: Oh. Promise
you won't get mad?

47
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:02,580
LANA: Uh, no?

48
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,784
Noooo...
ARCHER: I know, right? It's loud as balls.

49
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,185
LANA: When did it
start going off?!

50
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:12,390
ARCHER: I dunno, like... before the
muezzin, but after the Dutch co-eds left.

51
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,858
LANA: You brought
them up to the room?!

52
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,896
ARCHER: Aha, busted! You
did get some sleep!

53

54
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:57,167
ARCHER: How can you not love this place?
The sights, the sounds, the smells...

55
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:01,324
LANA: No, Archer, just one smell, singular,
which would knock a possum over.

56
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:05,256
ARCHER: Didelphis virginiana! My second
favorite animal with a prehensile -

57
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:05,996
LANA: Tail.

58
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:07,897
ARCHER: Thanks, Brett
Somers, yes, a tail.

59
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:08,965
LANA: You have one.

60
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:12,301
ARCHER: I wish, then I'd be like my first
favorite prehensile-tailed animal -

61
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:12,902
LANA: Archer?

62
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:15,404
ARCHER: Nightcrawler! AKA-
LANA: Archer.

63
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,873
ARCHER: Kurt Wagner, Lana.

64
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,609
Although he can teleport, so
the prehensile tail is -

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,344
LANA: Goddammit we're
being followed!

66
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,013
ARCHER: When were you
planning to tell me?!

67
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:24,080
LANA: I -- whooaaa!

68
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,917
LANA: Look ooouuut!

69
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,418
SCOOTER GUY (O.S.):
[shouting insults]

70
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,322
ARCHER: Oh yeah?! Well -- damn, I had
something in Arabic for this...

71
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,691
LANA: Wow, that
accidentally worked.

72
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,892
ARCHER: Accidentally?

73
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:38,094
LANA: Just drive.
There, take that left.

74
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,696
ARCHER: Hang on, I'm
swinging back around.

75
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,665
LANA: No you're not, why?

76
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,566
ARCHER: Because look in here and
tell me the Arabic phrase for

77
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,202
"your mother is a whore and
a goatherd is her pimp".

78
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,837
LANA: Oh, right, absolutely.

79
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,774
ARCHER: Oh for -- nice,
real mature, Lana!

80
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,910
LANA: Look, obviously Morrocan
intelligence isn't as stoked about

81
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,746
Kazak coming over to ISIS as your
mother is so can you please

82
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:57,947
quit dicking around!

83
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,182
ARCHER: Who's dicking around?!

84
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,785
Me, who's driving this clown
car like Parnelli Frickin

85
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:04,087
Jones, or you, Lana Litterbug!

86
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:09,625
LANA: Archer, I am seriously not in the
mood for your bullshit right n-owww!

87
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:13,129
LANA: Ahem ARCHER: Oh.
Hold on, I'm stopping.

88
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,030
LANA: Why.

89
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:17,433
ARCHER: Because according
to this we're here.

90
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,268
LANA: Are you coming?

91
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,971
ARCHER: No, but I'm
breathing fast.

92
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:22,906
[door slam]

93
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:28,477
ARCHER: Get it? Lana,
did you get it? Lana?

94
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,480
Or were you just trying not to laugh
because you're cranky for some reason.

95
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,084
LANA: I'm cranky because I didn't sleep-
ARCHER: Inaccurate.

96
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:37,320
LANA: -- and now I can't sleep, because
I'm pretty sure I have a concussion!

97
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:38,221
ARCHER: Wait, seriously?

98
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,389
LANA: Yes, Archer, my
head totally kills.

99
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,458
ARCHER: Well that's not good-
LANA: Wait, seriously?

100
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,628
ARCHER: -- because Tangier's totally awesome-
LANA: Wildly inaccurate.

101
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,998
ARCHER: -- but it's probably not the
best place to receive medical treatment.

102
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,836
LANA: So what say we grab this Kazak guy
and get out of this flyblown shithole.

103
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,470
ARCHER: Okay, but you're
missing out on all the great

104
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,472
things Tangier has to offer.

105
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:57,506
LANA: Name one.

106
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:01,845
ARCHER: Chee- LANA: Besides cheap hash
and a repulsingly low age of consent.

107
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:02,578
ARCHER: Rugs?

108
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,815
- Okay... - Shooting me's not gonna
change the unbeatableness

109
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,316
of their rug prices.

110
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,019
LANA: It might change my mood-
ARCHER: To remorseful?

111
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,889
LANA: -- but I drew because we don't know
what's waiting for us behind this -

112
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,959
Door. Ya know...
DOG (O.S.): Grrowwrrrgrrl!

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,692
LANA: Ungh!

00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:17,693
ARCHER: Lana!

115
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:18,594
LANA: Archer?

116
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:21,164
DOG: Grrrrrrrr...
ARCHER: How ya dooin, buddy?

117
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,166
LANA: I'll be better
when you shoot him.

118
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,669
ARCHER: I was talking to hiiim, stupid...
LANA: Great, then I'll shoo -

119
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,370
DOG: Grrowwoofwoofwoofrowwrr!

120
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:34,210
ARCHER: I don't think he likes guuuuns...
LANA: Okay, that's -- stop,

121
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,513
c'mon, cut it -Archer get
the damn dog off my tits!

122
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,783
ARCHER: Here boy! C'mon buddy!

123
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:43,319
Uh, heel? I don't think
he speaks English.

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,188
LANA: Well what's
"get off" in Arabic?!

125
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,224
ARCHER: She asked, regretfully, remembering
that just moments earlier she'd

126
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:50,827
thrown away his
eleven-dollar phrasebook.

127
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,228
LANA: Oh for the -- grrrrt off!

128
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,697
ARCHER: Oof! Who's a good boy?

129
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,632
Who's a good boy? Who's a
good boy good boy good boy?

130
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,034
LANA: Ugh, I thought
you hated dogs.

131
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:58,668
ARCHER: I love dogs, Lana.

132
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,703
Except Mother's dog.
Hated that dog.

133
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,306
LANA: Because she loved
it more than you?

134
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,808
ARCHER: Ha ha, very funny.

135
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:13,382
Although, she never forgot the dog's birthday...
[enchanting music]

136
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,318
LANA: Can we please
just do this?

137
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,019
DOG: Grrowwoofwoofwoofrowwrr!

138
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,886
LANA: Aagh!

139
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,221
ARCHER: What're you--
Lana put it away!

140
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:19,856
LANA: Alright okay
okay alright already!

141
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:23,092
ARCHER: See? He really doesn't like guns,
Lana, he can't stress that enough.

142
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:26,062
LANA: Well what are we supposed to do
if Kazak doesn't wanna come with us?

143
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,231
ARCHER: Feed him to Cujo here,
he can poop him out when we get

144
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:31,935
home. Who's a poopy
boy, who's a poopy boy?

145
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:35,471
LANA: Shit-breath slobberin-ass mutt...
ARCHER: Don't listen to her,

146
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:40,243
she's-
Wow, but you could use a tic-tac.

147
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:43,779
LANA: Kazak? Hello? Kazak.

148
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Kazak!

149
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,049
DOG: Woowoowoowoowoof!

150
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,350
LANA: Get away from me,
what're you doing?!

151
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,351
ARCHER: What're you doing?!

152
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:50,553
Lana, you can't beckon
him and then rebuff him!

153
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,754
LANA: Beckon and rebuff whom.

154
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:52,455
ARCHER: Kazak.

155
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:53,456
DOG: Woof?

156
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,625
LANA: Noooo, he's not--
he cannot be Kazak.

157
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,395
ARCHER: He can according
to his nametag.

158
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:02,232
LANA: Son of a... bitch!

159
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,933
KAZAK: Woowoowoowoowoof!

160
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:08,271
ARCHER: Well, technically she's right.
Who's a sonuvabitch? Are you a

161
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,805
sonuvabitch?

162
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:10,773
KAZAK: Woof!

163
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,709
ARCHER: Lana, look! He
thinks he's people!

164
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:21,011
LANA: Nooo, no, no, no no, nooo.

165
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:25,782
I did not sign on to be a dogsitter
for -- who's frickin dog is this?!

166
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:30,320
ARCHER: Who gives a shit, Lana, he's
like the Pl of, lemme finish, fetch!

167
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:30,954
KAZAK (O.S.): Woof!

168
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:33,056
ARCHER: Well I will if you bring it here!
I can't throw it

169
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,457
if it's in your mouth!

170
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,491
KAZAK (O.S.): Woowoowoof!

171
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,294
LANA: Why didn't
you become a vet?

172
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:38,829
ARCHER: Honestly?
Didn't have the grades.

173
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,197
LANA: No shit.

174
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,299
ARCHER: Why would I lie about that?
And who're you calling?

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,666
LANA: Who do you think.

176
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,437
ARCHER: Ask her if
we can keep him.

177
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:48,371
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Ms.

178
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,140
Archer, Lana for you, line one.

179
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,341
MALORY: I'm not here.

180
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:55,009
CHERYL/CAROL: Ooohhhh!
Then... how...?

181
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,611
MALORY: Oh for the love,
obviously I am here--

182
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,449
CHERYL/CAROL: Whew...

183
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,384
MALORY: -- I just don't
wish to speak to her!

184
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:05,055
CHERYL/CAROL: But you are here...
MALORY: Aht! If you walk over

185
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,891
here and touch me, you'll spend
your lunch hour being fitted

186
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:09,559
for a prosthetic hand.

187
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,029
CHERYL/CAROL: I only get forty-five minutes.
But I'll tell her

188
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,333
you're not here. But
you are, right?

189
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,133
MALORY: Out!

190
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,235
CHERYL/CAROL: Ahh!

191
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,803
MALORY: I assume Lana's mad
because Sterling's pushing her

192
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,039
buttons. What a surprise.

193
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,043
- Speaking of... - You finally saved
enough money for a sex change.

194
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:31,647
PAM: No. I'm actually broker than usual...
REFEREE: Nine...!

195
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,083
Ten...! She's out!

196
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,217
[ding, ding, ding]

197
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:38,721
PAM: Uht? Pungash bishiz...
PAM: But I'm very comfortable

198
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:42,893
in my own body, thank you very much, and-
MALORY: Don't thank me, thank -

199
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:46,596
PAM: And before you say-
MALORY: May I finish?! Archer

200
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,766
Daniels Midland, now what do
you want, I'm extremely busy.

201
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,833
PAM: To be a field agent!

202
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,435
MALORY: I'm sorry?

203
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:53,603
LANA (O.S.): You should be!

204
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:56,406
ARCHER: How was I supposed to know
it was gonna make him do that?!

205
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,375
[fweet]

206
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,010
LANA: Stuffing him full
of street kebabs?!

207
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:04,781
ARCHER: A, it was kufta, and bee-
elzebub's asshole, Kazak!

208
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,182
Bad dog! Bad dog!

209
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:09,252
KAZAK: [whine]

210
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:11,621
ARCHER: Sorry buddy, I didn't mean that, I-
LANA: I did! It's bad enough

211
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,924
your mother sends me on this
bullshit mission, but now she

212
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,625
won't even take my call?!

213
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:18,795
ARCHER: Lana, New York's five hours behind,
maybe she's not in the office yet.

214
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,730
LANA: Oh please,
she's totally there!

215
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:21,932
MALORY: Wh-?

216
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,565
Out!

217
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:23,566
CHERYL/CAROL: Just checking!

218
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:24,634
God!

219
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:30,907
MALORY: Idiot. As I was saying...
ARCHER: I'm! Sorry! And I'm sure I - [fweet]

220
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:35,578
ARCHER: -- ugh, also speak for Kazak,
who, by the way, is the real victim here.

221
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:37,880
LANA: How is he the victim?!

222
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,783
ARCHER: Lana, his nose is like a jillion
times more sensitive than ours!

223
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:41,784
[fweet]

224
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:45,488
ARCHER: Gotta be killing him...
LANA: Well before I kill him,

225
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,624
and you, just get us to the port.
Hopefully the stupid boat

226
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,060
to Spain has aspirin.

227
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:50,927
ARCHER: What boat?

228
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,996
LANA: What what boat,
the boat boat!

229
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:54,998
ARCHER: Wow, you might actually
be concussed, because

230
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,433
that was not a real sentence.

231
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,167
LANA: Archer?

232
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,569
ARCHER: And the boat's not a
boat, Lana, it's a frickin

233
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,604
hovercraft! Woohoohoohoooo!

234
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,473
KAZAK:
Woowoowoowooowoowooowooo!

235
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:08,311
ARCHER: Woohoo... oh. But, boat or not-boat...
We won't be getting on it.

236
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,280
LANA: A... roadblock?!

237
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,182
ARCHER: So, guess we're driving
through the desert to

238
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:14,017
the backup extraction point.

239
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:14,750
KAZAK: Rrowrf.

240
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,353
[sploosh]

241
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,687
LANA: uhh, uhh.

242
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:21,091
ARCHER: Sorry. I know you had your
heart set on that hovercraft ride.

243
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,860
MALORY: But why on earth do you
think you're qualified to

244
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,996
be an ISIS field agent?!

245
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:27,697
PAM: Uh, besides Cyril's one?

246
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,966
CYRIL: Hey...
PAM: Cyril? Ya wanna fresh one?

247
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,034
CYRIL: I do not, no.

248
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:35,271
PAM: Then shut your fist-hole, and show
Ms. Archer how I did on the IFAAB.

249
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:40,176
MALORY: The ISIS Field Agent
Aptitude Battery? You took it?

250
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:44,180
You aced it?! No, but --
this can't -- you cheated!

251
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:48,818
PAM: How?! Everybody watched me take it!
Under sterile conditions, by the way!

252
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,689
CYRIL: Well... [fweet]

253
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,362
PAM: What. Punkass bitches...
CYRIL: Sterile test conditions, anyway.

254
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:01,231
But I can promise she didn't cheat.

255
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:03,400
MALORY: Be that as it -- hm.

256
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:10,306
Hmm. Hmmmm? This means nothing,
My God, a perfect score on the

257
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:14,110
IFAAB merely indicates that a person
is a candidate for field agent

258
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,547
status, it can't determine if
they're suited for actual

259
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:22,352
field work. I mean, what if she
had to subdue an enemy agent?

260
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:27,090
PAM: Cue sad trombone, aaaaaaaaaaaand-Go!

261
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,859
EVERYBODY: Aaaaaagh!

262
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:37,534
MALORY: Pam! What the
hell did you -- waagh!

263
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:41,671
- My God... - And it goes on like that,
for another thirty-eight

264
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,406
soul-cleaving minutes.

265
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,108
GILLETTE: Of which you
were there for two.

266
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:49,245
KRIEGER: Three! I was scared,
I ran away, sue me. And then

267
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,747
sue me for this! Smoke bomb!

268
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:54,484
MALORY: So you aced the test and
beat up a nazi, a nerd, and

269
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,553
queen of the robots-
GILLETTE/CYRIL: Heeyyy!

270
00:11:56,554 --> 00:12:00,790
MALORY: If the saddle oxford and/or
ruby slipper fits! Mister and/or

271
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,461
missy! What makes you think
I need another field agent?

272
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:05,695
LANA: I quit.

273
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:09,399
ARCHER: Lana believe me, nobody wanted
to ride a hovercraft more than me, but -

274
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,667
LANA: Stop the car! I'm serious, I'm-
ARCHER: I'm serious, calm the

275
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:15,004
hell down! Here, hit this
hashbrown, that creepy old dude

276
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:18,408
put his lips on it, but-
LANA: Archer stop the goddamn car!

277
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:22,378
ARCHER: Lana put the gun down, he's gonna-
KAZAK: Yipe!

278
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,015
ARCHER: Stoppin the caaar, buuuddies...
LANA: Sorry about that,

279
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,784
furface. Wouldn't have shot
you for a gazillion bucks.

280
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:29,419
KAZAK: Rrowr?

281
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,487
LANA: You, not so much.

282
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:34,157
ARCHER: Lana c'mon, we both know you're-
LANA: Quitting, Archer, yes, exactly.

283
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,827
ARCHER: Oh. I was gonna
say "not quitting."

284
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,095
LANA: Wildlier inaccurate.

285
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:43,433
ARCHER: "Wildlier" isn't a real word, by the way.
At least not in English.

286
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,767
KAZAK: Rrowr?

287
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:47,937
ARCHER: I dunno, she threw away my phraseboo-
[fweet]

288
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,472
ARCHER: Almost kind of
wishing she'd shot you.

289
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:50,440
KAZAK: Roowr.

290
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,743
ARCHER: No, no, no, I'm kidding
Who's my stinky boy, huh?

291
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,778
Who's my... [fweet]

292
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:59,182
ARCHER: So hey, I know we kid
around a lot, but I think you

293
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,683
might have dog cancer.

294
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,408
ARCHER: No way, I'm not going back for her.
You're new here,

295
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,545
but Lana cries wolf on quitting
ISIS like twice a week.

296
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,346
KAZAK: Rowr.

297
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:14,949
ARCHER: She'll be fine.
She's got... oh.

298
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,353
I was gonna say GPS, gun, sat-phone,
and canteen full of lifesaving water.

299
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,321
KAZAK: Rowr.

300
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:23,023
ARCHER: Well?! She's the one who
stormed off into the desert

301
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:27,361
with no GPS, no gun, no sat-
phone and no lifesaving water,

302
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,731
and why the hell are you taking her
side, she jammed a gun in your -

303
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:31,565
KAZAK: Rrowrf.

304
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,366
[sploosh]

305
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,702
ARCHER: So, were you whining
about Lana being an idiot or

306
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,471
about you being carsick?

307
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:41,275
KAZAK: Rrf.

308
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,043
ARCHER: How much frickin
kufta did you eat?!

309
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:43,844
KAZAK: Ruff!

310
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:47,248
ARCHER: Well? Whose fault is that?!
Okay, so maybe I egged

311
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,984
you on to eat five orders of it, and...
maybe I push Lana's

312
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:53,787
buttons on purpose, and just
generally make her life hell...

313
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:57,657
Which maybe I do, possibly, if
I'm being completely honest,

314
00:13:57,658 --> 00:14:01,996
because I still have some pretty strong-
Ah, God damn, dude. Okay,

315
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:09,569
we'll go back for her. But
not because you said so!

316
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,941
LANA (O.S.): Because you let him,
you let him push your buttons.

317
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:19,413
That's why you stormed off with no
GPS, gun, phone, or lifesaving water.

318
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:23,951
And that's why you died in the desert.
Holy shit I'm

319
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:28,555
gonna die in the desert. Just
like Cheryl's gypsy woman said!

320
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:33,394
LANA: How. Would I ever.
Die in a dessert.

321
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:37,097
LANA: Well, pretty close. And
you're not gonna die out here,

322
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:38,532
because any minute now... aha!

323
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,433
Haaa!

324
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:45,139
Archer's gonna come crawling back to
you, tail between his legs, from - From

325
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,409
the wrong direction. Oh, shit.

326
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,946
Oh, shit.

327
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:55,316
ARCHER: Wait wait wait, shut up, what?
What are you talking about?!

328
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:58,986
CHERYL/CAROL: I dunno, like maybe a
gigantic chocolate mousse, or -

329
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,321
ARCHER (O.S.): I said desert!

330
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,722
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.
Still pretty close.

331
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,724
ARCHER: Will you put
Mother on the damn phone?!

332
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,460
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.):
What's the magic woooord?

333
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,429
ARCHER: Oh for the --please!

334
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,230
CHERYL/CAROL: No,
they changed it.

335
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:15,970
ARCHER: Cheryl, you
stupid [beeeeeeeeeeeep]

336
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:18,172
CHERYL/CAROL: Lucky guess.

337
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,040
PAM: Plus I'm a quick learner
plus you've seen me drive I'm

338
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,709
an amazing driver plus I almost
never get sick plus I already

339
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,846
bought three pantsuits plus-
MALORY: Alright! I'll think about it!

340
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,681
PAM: Is that a real you'll
think about it, or a "Pam if

341
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:30,717
your pig Leon wins a blue ribbon
at the county fair maybe

342
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:33,354
we won't kill him and eat him
for Easter dinner and render

343
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:37,124
what's left into soap"
you'll think about it?

344
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,326
MALORY: It's-
PAM: Because I never really got over that.

345
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,296
MALORY: It's a real one-
PAM: Yaaaaaay!

346
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,799
MALORY: -- but thank you for that glimpse
into your bleak, farmy childhood.

347
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,170
PAM: It was actually pretty awesome.
And if I'm being honest, so was Leon.

348
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,838
MALORY: Get out. What.

349
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,371
ARCHER (O.S.): Mother? Mother
it's Sterling, don't talk just...

350
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,209
MALORY: Ohhhh no!

351
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,279
ARCHER: Guess I had that coming.

352
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,049
MALORY: You must really think I'm an idiot...
ARCHER: Well, your

353
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,451
words Mother, but my
voicemail doesn't call you.

354
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:08,622
MALORY: Oh right. What's going on, did
you get Kazak, are you on the boat yet?

355
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,525
ARCHER: Okay, in order, I'll
get to that, yes, no, and

356
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,428
it's not a boat, it's a-
MALORY: Hovercraft, whatever,

357
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:15,295
why aren't you people on it?!

358
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:18,765
ARCHER: Well for starters, some of us
aren't people! But they think they

359
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,068
are! Yes they do! Yes they do!

360
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,903
Yes they -
MALORY: Sterling!

361
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:26,840
ARCHER: Oh, so anyway, Lana quit, and-
MALORY: She -- what'd you do this time?!

362
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,875
ARCHER: Nothing! She quit
because you made us fly to

363
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,878
Morocco, coach, by the way, and
don't even get me started on

364
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,583
that! For a dog! You know how
insulting that is?! A stupid dog?!

365
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,552
MALORY: Wh-? Is this about
the carriage ride?!

366
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:41,555
ARCHER: The -- I mean, I'd be lying
if I said it wasn't a factor! But -

367
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,290
MALORY: Let me tell you
something about that so-called

368
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,561
"stupid" dog, mister man...
ARCHER: Are you -- that's all

369
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:51,532
we were after?! Well?! You
could've told us, Mother! Oh!

370
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:55,369
And you could've told me you
just took her to the stupid vet!

371
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,940
MALORY: Whoooo just had a lovely birthday
carriage ride through Central Paaark?

372
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:00,574
DUCHESS: Woof!

373
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:05,279
MALORY: Yes she did!
Yes she did!

374
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,248
DUCHESS: Grrrrrrrr...
ARCHER: Whatever, look, we're

375
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,951
not gonna make it to the backup
extraction point, so get a fix

376
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:14,020
on my signal and reroute the
chopper to those coordinates!

377
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:16,856
MALORY: Okay, rerouting
now, ETA ten minutes.

378
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:21,462
ARCHER: Whenever, we'll be here...
One way or the other.

379
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,263
So hey, how you
doin on the kufta?

380
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:24,064
KAZAK: Rrf.

381
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:28,535
ARCHER: Yeah good, get it all out now.
Because this next part's gonna suck.

382
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,804
PASSENGER AGENT: [yelling]

383
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:38,445
LANA: Archerrrr!

384
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:43,283
ARCHER: See?! That's why I said scrooch down!
Lana! Lana scrooch down!

385
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:48,655
LANA: No no no, Archer don't
Are you out of your mind?!

386
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:49,623
ARCHER: No!

387
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:54,628
Although I am out of ammo. Okay
buddy, so here's the deal!

388
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:57,397
A, scrooch down! And B,
normally in this situation I

389
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,899
do a a pit maneuver, but if I
do that the truck will flip,

390
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,702
and if Lana doesn't die, best
case she's a quadriplegic and I

391
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,172
marry her out of guilt but
after a few years of feeding

392
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:07,907
tubes and colostomy bags I
start to resent her and the

393
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:10,477
night nurse is like,
Brazilian and twenty?

394
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,179
KAZAK (O.S.): Grrrr...
ARCHER: Don't judge me! I have

395
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,048
needs, man! The point is, and
it might be a kinda shitty

396
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,252
plan, but I'm gonna jump on the
truck, so I need you to take the -

397
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:18,985
KAZAK (O.S.): Grrowwrrrgrrl!

398
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,488
ARCHER: -- wheel, exactly, so...
Kazak?

399
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,457
AGENTS (O.S.): Aaaggghhhh!

400
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,791
KAZAK: Grrowwrrghhh!

401
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,794
ARCHER: Lana, look! He
thinks he's vampires!

402
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,364
KAZAK: Grrowwrrgh!

403
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,466
ARCHER: Lana look ooouuut!

404
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:35,669
Kazaaaaaaaak!

405
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,339
AGENT: Ungh,

406
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,586
ARCHER: Nah, guys probably got
nine wives and a jillion

407
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:56,490
kids and.. holy shit, that's racist
Archer, what is wrong with you?

408
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,292
LANA (O.S.): Seriously...
ARCHER: Lana!

409
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,795
LANA: Archer, thank-
ARCHER: God is he hit, tell me he's not hit!

410
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:02,529
LANA: He's fine.

411
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,497
KAZAK: Woof!

412
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:06,187
LANA: As am I, not that you
give a shit.

413
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,435
ARCHER: Shhh. Lana, don't ruin the moment...
LANA: What moment, what're you

414
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,541
-- ahhh.

415
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,158
What're you doing, what is that?

416
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,848
ARCHER: Microfilm. It was on
his collar the whole time,

417
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:18,729
something about nukes in
Pakistan or -- one of the

418
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:22,398
akistans, I forget
which one. Owwww!

419
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,537
My point is sometimes we do good work.
So promise me you'll never quit again.

420
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:33,677
LANA: Only if you promise you'll
quit being such a colossal asshole.

421
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,013
ARCHER: Mmmm.

422
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,381
I can't.

423
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:43,855
LANA: Ya know...
KAZAK: Woowoowoowoowoowoowoof!

424
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,023
LANA: What.

425
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:49,528
