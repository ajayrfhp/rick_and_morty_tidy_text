1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,595
(Archer moaning deliriously)

2
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:07,564
>> LANA: Archer.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,565
>> ARCHER: Lana?

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,566
(Lana yelps)

5
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:10,567
Lana!

6
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:11,568
>> LANA: Whoa, Jesus Christ!

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,736
Chill out, Miggs!

8
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:13,971
>> ARCHER: I'm sorry, it's just

9
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:14,972
been so long.

10
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:15,973
>> LANA: Okay, it's been...

11
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:16,974
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God.

12
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:17,975
You're pregnant again?!

13
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:18,976
>> LANA: What?

14
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:19,977
>> ARCHER: How long have I been

15
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,511
down here, left to rot in this

16
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,347
godforsaken hole?!

17
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,183
>> LANA: Like... three weeks.

18
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,517
>> ARCHER: Hmm, seems so much

19
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,518
longer than that.

20
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,519
>> LANA: It...

21
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,520
>> ARCHER: So, please tell me

22
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:32,022
that's an entire <i>canard à la</i>

23
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,490
 <i>presse</i> with a file in it.

24
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,491
>> LANA: Half a chicken, no

25
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,692
file, just that weird

26
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:37,194
quasi-cornbread they have here.

27
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:38,195
>> ARCHER: Ugh, why do you even

28
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:39,196
bother?

29
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:40,197
>> LANA: That's weird, I was

30
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:41,598
asking myself the same thing on

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,699
the way down here.

32
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:43,700
>> ARCHER: And then brought

33
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,202
crappy food anyway?

34
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:46,203
>> LANA: And then left?

35
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,270
>> ARCHER: No, no, no, wait,

36
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:48,271
come on, Lana, I-I'm sorry, but

37
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:49,272
I-I'm starting to lose it down

38
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:49,973
here.

39
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:50,640
You-you got to make him let

40
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:51,641
me go!

41
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:52,642
>> LANA: Make him how?

42
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:53,643
>> ARCHER: Well, I hate to

43
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:54,644
even ask, but...

44
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:55,645
>> LANA: Blow him?

45
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:56,646
>> ARCHER: Your words.

46
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:57,647
>> LANA: And then what, Archer,

47
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:58,648
you want me to blow the whole

48
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,649
army?

49
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:00,650
>> ARCHER: How is there still

50
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:01,651
an army?

51
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,652
How have the rebels not wiped

52
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,054
them out already?

53
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,055
>> LANA: Because turns out,

54
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:06,289
he's actually very good at

55
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,891
commanding an army.

56
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:08,892
>> CYRIL: And as Third and

57
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,327
Fourth Battalion withdraw, here

58
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,029
comes First Armored, and now the

59
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,164
rebels are outflanked.

60
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,132
>> COMANDANTE (laughs): Sir,

61
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:16,366
it's brilliant!

62
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,534
>> CYRIL: A classic pincher

63
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,535
movement.

64
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,536
Just like Hannibal at the battle

65
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,637
of Cannae.

66
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,039
And also Keith, in my

67
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,206
Warhammer guild.

68
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,541
>> LANA: So, get used to that

69
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,043
weird cornbread, 'cause you

70
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,044
might be down here a...

71
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,211
>> ARCHER: Lana, I need a

72
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,380
woman's touch!

73
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,681
(Lana grunts)

74
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,350
Oh! Ow!

75
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:34,551
I'm sorry, Lana.

76
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,919
I said a woman, not a

77
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,521
stevedore who lost his hand

78
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,189
in a stevedoring accident

79
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:40,490
and then got a hand transplant

80
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,692
from an actual bear.

81
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:44,027
>> LANA: So, did you want to

82
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:45,028
just do it right through the

83
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,029
bars or...?

84
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,999
>> ARCHER: I mean, we do.

85
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,368
And sometimes they do.

86
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,702
>> CALDÉRON: Hello.

87
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:53,703
>> LANA: I... wait.

88
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,172
So, in three weeks, you go from

89
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,074
you're gonna execute Archer

90
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,208
to now you guys are, like,

91
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,276
swinger pals?

92
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:00,343
>> CALDÉRON: Well, I wouldn't

93
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,411
say "pals."

94
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,946
>> ARCHER: Wow, not what you

95
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:03,947
said yesterday.

96
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:04,948
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, come on, that

97
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,183
was the pruno talking.

98
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:07,551
>> LANA: Well, I hate to break

99
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:08,919
up this delightful ménage, but

100
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,220
Presidente Cyril wants her back

101
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,455
upstairs.

102
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:12,456
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?

103
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,557
>> CALDÉRON: What?

104
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,558
>> JULIANA: Why.

105
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,559
>> LANA: Guess.

106
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,726
>> JULIANA: Ah.

107
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,128
>> LANA: Mm.

108
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,129
>> CALDÉRON: Ow!

109
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,130
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

110
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,131
wait, wait, wait!

111
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,132
>> BOTH: What?

112
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:24,067
>> CALDÉRON: Archer, do you want

113
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,303
me to move over one?

114
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,371
>> ARCHER: Eh.

115
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,514
>> CYRIL: Ah, Madame First Lady.

116
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:12,916
So good of you to join me.

117
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:13,917
>> JULIANA: It's not as if I

118
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,918
had a choice.

119
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,919
>> CYRIL: Well...

120
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:16,920
>> JULIANA: Nor am I still the

121
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:17,921
the first lady.

122
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:18,955
>> CYRIL: Well, maybe not

123
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,090
technically, since your husband

124
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,124
divorced you and then was

125
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:22,926
immediately deposed by me, but

126
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,628
the situation is, as they say,

127
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,029
fluid.

128
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,097
>> LANA: Ugh.

129
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,265
I brought her, can I go now?

130
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,332
>> CYRIL: Yes, for the love of

131
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,333
God, get out.

132
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,668
>> LANA: I meant home.

133
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,669
>> PAM (laughing): What are you,

134
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,670
nuts?

135
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,038
Cap'n Crunch here just

136
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,039
took all the coca fields back

137
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,040
from the rebels.

138
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,041
We're sitting on an endless

139
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:39,042
supply.

140
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,043
>> LANA: Of what, coca leaf

141
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,111
smoothies?

142
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:42,379
(rhythmic gulping)

143
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,380
Oh, my God.

144
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,614
That's a coca leaf smoothie.

145
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:45,649
>> CHERLENE: And they're gross.

146
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:46,983
It basically tastes like a fart

147
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:48,518
of itself, but it's better than

148
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,953
the cocaine donuts and whipped

149
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:50,954
cocaine she was eating.

150
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:51,955
(Pam burps)

151
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,023
>> PAM: 'Cause that's just empty

152
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,024
calories.

153
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,158
>> LANA: Well, and cocaine.

154
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,159
>> PAM: Which, if I'm being

155
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,360
totally honest, I maybe might

156
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,029
have a problem with.

157
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,497
>> LANA: No.

158
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,498
>> CYRIL: And, Lana, the rebels

159
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,499
still control the airport.

160
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,567
It's their HQ.

161
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,901
So, unless you want to walk, you

162
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,036
can't go home.

163
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,037
>> MALORY: And why on Earth

164
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,038
would you want to?

165
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,039
(Lana sighs)

166
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,040
>> CYRIL: Uh...

167
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,041
>> MALORY: Why bother going

168
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,042
back?

169
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,043
The U.S. government stole your

170
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,044
livelihood, forced you to become

171
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,179
a criminal.

172
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,547
And I hate to say it, but it's

173
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,982
not like you have a man waiting

174
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,050
for you.

175
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,384
>> LANA: I... You know...

176
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,485
>> MALORY: Whereas here we have

177
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,054
everything we need.

178
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,322
It's like San Marcos has been

179
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,923
waiting thousands of years for

180
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,191
us to arrive.

181
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,392
Lana, this could be our...

182
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,393
>> LANA: Don't.

183
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,394
>> MALORY: Zion, yes, there, I

184
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,395
said it.

185
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,396
(Pam burps)

186
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,397
>> PAM: Wait, they got weed

187
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,398
here, too?

188
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,399
>> LANA: That's not what the

189
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,400
song's about!

190
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,401
>> CHERLENE: Told you.

191
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,402
>> LANA: But I just this second

192
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,437
realized why you want to stay

193
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,005
down here.

194
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,206
Cyril's just the Vader to your

195
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,574
Palpatine.

196
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,042
>> MALORY: Is that a reference

197
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,210
I should get, or...?

198
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,345
>> LANA: Seriously?

199
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:49,379
>> MALORY: Well, I'm sorry,

200
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:50,680
Lana, I didn't go to rabbinical

201
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:52,015
school.

202
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,116
>> LANA: It's from... No, you

203
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,384
know what? Never mind.

204
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:55,452
But, spoiler alert, Vader ends

205
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:56,453
up killing Palpatine.

206
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:57,454
>> CYRIL: Hey.

207
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:58,455
>> CHERLENE: But only for three

208
00:04:58,457 --> 00:04:59,456
days, right?

209
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,457
And then he moves the rock and

210
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,458
comes out of his cave stronger

211
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,459
than ever.

212
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,460
>> PAM: Then he shuts off the

213
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,461
tractor beam, releasing the Jews

214
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:05,462
from captivity.

215
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:06,463
>> LANA: What?

216
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,464
>> CYRIL: Hey.

217
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,465
>> MALORY: Wait, yes, now that

218
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,432
sounds familiar.

219
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,368
>> LANA: It cannot possibly.

220
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,369
>> MALORY: Gospel of Luke?

221
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,370
>> CYRIL: Hey.

222
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,371
>> LANA: Oh for... Ray, you used

223
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:15,372
to be a preacher, you want to

224
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:16,373
back me up here?

225
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,374
>> RAY: I actually don't know.

226
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,375
My church didn't really do the

227
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,409
New Testament.

228
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,710
>> LANA: The one with Jesus

229
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:22,212
Christ in it.

230
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:23,280
>> RAY: I mean, I take your

231
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,381
word for it, but...

232
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,482
>> CYRIL: Hey!

233
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,549
Will you idiots get out?!

234
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm trying to talk to the first

235
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,551
lady!

236
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:29,552
>> CHERLENE: Of what, this

237
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,087
country or country music?

238
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,555
'Cause I'm first lady of both!

239
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:33,590
CYRIL No, you're not...

240
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,925
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country!

241
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:38,061
(jail door bangs shut)

242
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,162
(Cherlene sighs)

243
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:40,096
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, my

244
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,097
beautiful and also

245
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,399
multi-talented wife!

246
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,967
You are here!

247
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,068
>> CHERLENE: I know, right?

248
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,436
It's like, finally.

249
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:47,637
>> ARCHER: As in...

250
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,571
this is a good thing?

251
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:49,406
(plays random notes)

252
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:50,173
>> CHERLENE: Duh!

253
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,174
I'm finally gonna get the outlaw

254
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,109
country cred I deserve.

255
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,277
>> CALDÉRON: Oh, my God, you've

256
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,412
always deserved it.

257
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,413
>> ARCHER: Wait, how does being

258
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:57,414
in jail...?

259
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,415
>> CHERLENE: Paging Dr. Black,

260
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,949
Dr. Man In Black!

261
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,484
Johnny Cash was in Folsom Prison

262
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,986
and San Quentin, so...

263
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,021
>> ARCHER: Yeah, to visit.

264
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,189
>> CHERLENE: Hmm?

265
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,190
>> ARCHER: He just played for

266
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,191
the prisoners, dummy.

267
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:11,027
He wasn't actually in prison.

268
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,362
(plays "womp womp")

269
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,363
But don't worry.

270
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,364
We're gonna get out of here and

271
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,032
go join the rebels.

272
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,033
>> CALDÉRON: Yes, then you and

273
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,301
I, my beautiful wife, will live

274
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,036
a simple life in the hills,

275
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,638
scratching shit food, like yams,

276
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,139
out of the ground with a, uh,

277
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,941
yam-scratcher.

278
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:25,942
>> CHERLENE: Okay, A-- start

279
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,010
counting backwards from a

280
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,044
million years, and when you get

281
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:29,212
to zero that still won't

282
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,547
happen.

283
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:31,548
>> CALDÉRON: Aw.

284
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,616
>> CHERLENE: And B-- how...

285
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,185
how do we get out of here?

286
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,619
>> ARCHER: Well, we're, uh,

287
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:38,288
still fine-tuning it, but...

288
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,289
>> CALDÉRON: We have no plan,

289
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,290
whatsoever.

290
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,291
>> CHERLENE: Okay, good, because

291
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,359
I didn't want to step on

292
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,494
anybody's toes, but byoink.

293
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:45,495
>> CALDÉRON: Whaaaaat?

294
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:46,496
>> ARCHER: Where did you get

295
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,497
that?

296
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:48,665
>> CHERLENE: Let's just say,

297
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,133
"I honestly don't know."

298
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:51,134
>> ARCHER: Fair enough.

299
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,135
>> CHERLENE: Cyril says the

300
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,236
rebel headquarters are...

301
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,538
Wait, is it "are" or is it "is"?

302
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,173
>> ARCHER: It's "where," idiot!

303
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,174
>> CHERLENE: The airport!

304
00:06:58,176 --> 00:06:59,209
Jesus!

305
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,210
>> CALDÉRON: And you, sir, will

306
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,578
keep a civil tongue in your head

307
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,579
when you are addressing

308
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,580
the First Lady of the

309
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:04,714
government-in-exile of La

310
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,316
República de San Marcos!

311
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:07,217
>> CHERLENE: And also country

312
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,051
music.

313
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,552
>> ARCHER: I facetiously beg

314
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,920
milady's pardon.

315
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:11,988
>> CHERLENE: Oh, milady

316
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,590
facetiously grants it.

317
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,024
>> ARCHER: Oh, goody.

318
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,226
Now let's steal a car, go join

319
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,527
the rebels, then come back here

320
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,062
and crush Cyril's stupid army.

321
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,063
>> CALDÉRON: You make it sound

322
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,064
so easy.

323
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,998
>> ARCHER (chuckling): Well,

324
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,665
it's Cyril.

325
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:23,666
I mean, unless he's got a

326
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,368
nuclear warhead in his pants...

327
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,369
>> CHERLENE: Which he totally

328
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,004
does.

329
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,173
>> KRIEGER: Which, guys, can we

330
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,274
talk about this?

331
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,208
>> KRIEGER CLONE 1: The time for

332
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,210
talk is kaput, <i>Klon-Bruder.</i>

333
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:36,112
Now is the time for action!

334
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,581
>> KRIEGER CLONE 2: Clone bone!

335
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,949
>> CHERLENE: And by that I mean

336
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,218
his... you know...

337
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,219
>> ARCHER: Yeah, we...

338
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,221
>> CHERLENE: Let me finish!

339
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,556
...penis.

340
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:47,557
No, you ruined it.

341
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,392
And by "it," I meant the moment.

342
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:52,061
Not his penis.

343
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,029
>> ARCHER: I...

344
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,931
>> CHERLENE: Penis.

345
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,602
>> ARCHER: Will you shut up?!

346
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,037
I know what I'm doing!

347
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,205
>> CALDÉRON: Yes, but don't do

348
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,406
what you are doing!

349
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:04,974
(Caldéron and Cherlene yelp)

350
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,609
(Archer chuckles)

351
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,544
>> CALDÉRON: Are you crazy?!

352
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,112
This car is worth one quarter of

353
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,113
$1 million!

354
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:10,980
>> CHERLENE: Well, <i>was.</i>

355
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:11,915
>> ARCHER: And did you ever

356
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:12,715
think maybe your fleet of

357
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,284
priceless cars is the reason

358
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,318
you're fighting off a

359
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,219
rebellion?

360
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,253
>> CALDÉRON: I'm fighting the

361
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,154
rebels because that is what we

362
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:19,155
do!

363
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:20,256
My father fought the rebels, his

364
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,257
father fought the rebels...

365
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,158
>> CHERLENE: So, like a family

366
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,159
business.

367
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,160
>> ARCHER: That manufactures

368
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:25,161
oppression.

369
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,162
>> CALDÉRON: Well, and cocaine.

370
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,063
In fact...

371
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,064
>> CHERLENE: Stop!

372
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,300
(Archer and Caldéron scream)

373
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,634
(tires screeching)

374
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,902
>> ARCHER: What?!

375
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:33,903
>> CHERLENE: That.

376
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:34,904
(Archer gasps)

377
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:36,105
I mean, if you think we have

378
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,307
time.

379
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,508
(tiger roars)

380
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,509
>> ARCHER: I... Is there a

381
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:40,343
tiger?

382
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,344
>> CALDÉRON: Of course there is

383
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,245
a tiger.

384
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,112
Where did you think you are,

385
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:44,514
Tegucigalpa?

386
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:46,516
(Archer giggles gleefully)

387
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,284
(tires squealing)

388
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:49,586
>> CYRIL: And so, by the power

389
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,521
self-vested in me, I now

390
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,157
pronounce us man and wife, and I

391
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,259
may also kiss the bride.

392
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,595
(Cyril kissing, Juliana grunts)

393
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,364
>> PAM: Yay!

394
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,632
>> MALORY: Ugh, second worst

395
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,633
wedding ever.

396
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:04,534
>> RAY: Yeah, but at least

397
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,702
nobody died.

398
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,203
>> PAM (laughing): Yet!

399
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,471
(clears throat)

400
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:09,472
Inappropes.

401
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:10,373
>> MALORY: What is wrong with

402
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,207
you?

403
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,208
>> PAM: I'm trying to make that

404
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,676
a thing people say, like,

405
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,179
"Damn, dawg, that's inappropes!"

406
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,881
Plus, I think I'm addicted to

407
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:18,982
cocaine.

408
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:19,983
>> MALORY: Well, but look on the

409
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,185
bright side.

410
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,186
With any luck at all, it will

411
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,521
save me the trouble of killing

412
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,322
you myself.

413
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:27,891
>> PAM (sniffling): Damn,

414
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,025
dawg...

415
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,293
>> RAY: Inappropes.

416
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,495
>> PAM: Yay!

417
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:33,963
>> ARCHER (quietly): Yay!

418
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:35,031
Yay!

419
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,332
(tiger roars)

420
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,135
They should've sent a poet.

421
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,537
Oh, and some meat.

422
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,171
Do we have any meat?

423
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,373
(elephant trumpets)

424
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,474
>> CALDÉRON: Literally tons.

425
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:45,475
>> ARCHER: No, I didn't mean

426
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:46,676
another animal.

427
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,077
I meant like a steak, or some...

428
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,379
>> CALDÉRON: Typical American.

429
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,547
You think meat comes from the

430
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,714
 <i>supermercado,</i> all wrapped in a

431
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,249
nice plastic wrap.

432
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,083
>> ARCHER: Yeah, you're

433
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:54,984
describing meat.

434
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:55,652
>> CALDÉRON: No, no, no.

435
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:57,086
Meat is blood and bones and

436
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,087
sinew!

437
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,022
>> ARCHER: Well, now you're

438
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,323
describing not-meat.

439
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,324
>> CALDÉRON: Meat is whatever

440
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,026
the tiger says is meat, because

441
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,894
God made him the boss and all

442
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,896
the other animals his food!

443
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,531
(tiger roars)

444
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,033
>> ARCHER: Hang on, buddy.

445
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,701
And thank you, George Bore-well,

446
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,202
for that clunky analogy in

447
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,038
defense of totalitarianism, but

448
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,239
I'm not feeding Shane an

449
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,240
elephant.

450
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,241
>> CHERLENE: Who the hell is...

451
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,375
(gasps)

452
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:20,910
Oh, my God, he's totally a

453
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,045
Shane.

454
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:23,513
So let me bounce this off you

455
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,281
guys...

456
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,282
>> KRIEGER: What say we don't

457
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:27,517
launch this giant nerve gas

458
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,952
missile at, uh...

459
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,386
where did you say you were

460
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:31,387
launching it?

461
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,422
>> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Wouldn't you

462
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,289
like to know?

463
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,624
(hearty laughter)

464
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,692
>> KRIEGER: I would, actually.

465
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:36,693
Come on, you guys are acting

466
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,528
a little... insane.

467
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,529
>> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Do you know

468
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:40,530
what's insane?!

469
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,898
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, this.

470
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,466
All of it, everything.

471
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,034
The rocket, uh... I'm not really

472
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:45,702
comfortable with the

473
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:46,536
clone-bone.

474
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:47,537
>> KRIEGER CLONE 1: You're not

475
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,404
doing it right.

476
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:49,305
Now move, so I can begin the

477
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:50,473
launch sequence.

478
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,709
>> KRIEGER: Over my dead...

479
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,910
...body, man that was a jinx,

480
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:54,544
huh?

481
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,378
(cocks gun)

482
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,913
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

483
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:57,914
>> ARCHER: Hang on!

484
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,382
As amazing as it would be,

485
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,050
we can't take Shane with us.

486
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:01,918
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, we can,

487
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,585
watch.

488
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,453
>> BOTH: No, no, no, no!

489
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,221
No, don't!

490
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,322
(low rumbling growl)

491
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:07,323
>> CALDÉRON: Okay, okay, okay,

492
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:08,925
okay.

493
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,460
>> ARCHER: Carol, listen to me

494
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,961
very closely.

495
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:12,962
>> CHERLENE: Why, you gonna walk

496
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,063
me through your organic method

497
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,264
of vaginal hygiene?

498
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,265
>> ARCHER: My what?

499
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,233
>> CHERLENE: You're a bigger

500
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,334
pussy than Shane!

501
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,636
Come here, boy! (smacking lips)

502
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,405
(tiger roars, Caldéron screams)

503
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,173
>> ARCHER AND CHERLENE: Shane!

504
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:25,241
(Caldéron screams)

505
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:26,442
>> CHERLENE: Do something!

506
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:27,510
(Caldéron screaming)

507
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,445
>> ARCHER: Like what?

508
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,080
>> KRIEGER CLONE 1: Get him!

509
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,983
(grunting)

510
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:34,984

00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,050
>> ARCHER: Look at me.

682
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,985
>> CHERLENE: I got it!

683
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:30,052
Jesus!

684
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,087
>> ARCHER: Okay.

685
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,221
Then here we go.

686
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,524
(rebels shouting in Spanish)

687
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:36,993
>> REBEL SOLDIER: <i>Pinche cabrón!</i>

688
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:37,660
>> CHERLENE: Ow!

689
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:38,527
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it!

690
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,029
You said you'd let me do the...

691
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,030
(grunts)

692
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,598
(Cherlene laughing)

693
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,666
>> REBEL SOLDIER 2: <i>¡Espere,</i>

694
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:44,533
 <i>espere!</i>

695
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,368
 <i>¡Mira, mira!</i>

696
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,535
 <i>Es la cantante!</i>

697
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,603
>> CHERLENE: ¶ It's all about me

698
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:48,437
this time... ¶

699
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:50,239
Aw...

700
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,207
>> MALORY: So.

701
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,942
You're saying this gigantic

702
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,410
rocket is not only full of

703
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,512
deadly nerve gas, but also aimed

704
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:58,114
God knows where?

705
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,215
>> KRIEGER: Well, that statement

706
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:00,449
presupposes the existence of

707
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:01,350
God, but...

708
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:02,285
>> MALORY: Krieger, I am about

709
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,552
two seconds away from telling

710
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:05,588
Pam to get a wooden stake.

711
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,023
>> PAM: Yay!

712
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,524
>> KRIEGER: I'm not a vampire!

713
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,525
>> MALORY: Doesn't matter to

714
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:10,526
the stake.

715
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:11,394
>> KRIEGER: Then yes!

716
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,395
It's full of nerve gas, and I

717
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,396
don't know where it's aimed!

718
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,263
>> LANA: What?

719
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,264
What's the range on this thing?

720
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,265
>> KRIEGER: I don't know, 2,000

721
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,133
miles?

722
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:18,034
(Malory gasps)

723
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:18,901
>> MALORY: How far away is the

724
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:19,969
Upper East Side?

725
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,703
>> KRIEGER: I don't know,

726
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,471
1,980-something miles?

727
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:23,472
(Malory screams)

728
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:24,373
>> CYRIL: Okay, this is a

729
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,441
presidential order from the

730
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,542
president.

731
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:27,543
Shut it down!

732
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:28,411
>> KRIEGER: I can't!

733
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,046
>> PAM: Can't, or won't?

734
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,047
>> KRIEGER: Can't!

735
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:31,714
>> PAM: Oh.

736
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:32,982
I didn't hear you.

737
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:33,716
>> LANA: Ray, can you override

738
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,117
the launch sequence?

739
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,118
>> RAY: Um...

740
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,986
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Launch

741
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:37,720
sequence accelerated.

742
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:38,554
>> RAY: No.

743
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,322
(all exclaiming)

744
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,423
>> MALORY: Oh, for God's sake.

745
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:41,390
>> SEXY ROBOT VOICE: Minutes to

746
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:42,391
launch: 90.

747
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:43,559
>> LANA: Cyril...

748
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:44,593
>> CYRIL: Uh, it's actually

749
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,329
Señor Presidente, but...

750
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,964
>> LANA: Shh, hush.

751
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,166
Now I know you've had a fun time

752
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,335
as dictator, and we all enjoyed

753
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:54,003
this little break from him,

754
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,138
but Cyril-- and if you tell him

755
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,340
I said this, I'll break your

756
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:01,677
frickin' arms-- it's... ugh...

757
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,279
Archer time.

758
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:05,247
>> CYRIL: Wha...?

759
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,682
Oh, all right.

760
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,517
>> LANA: Krieger, I assume the

761
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,352
whatever...

762
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:10,353
>> PAM: Doppelkriegers.

763
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:11,320
>> LANA: I assume they had a

764
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,621
lab, so take Ray and see if you

765
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:13,622
can find some info on how to

766
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:15,257
shut this damn thing down.

767
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:16,459
We'll go get Archer.

768
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,526
>> PAM: Ooh, and Cherlene!

769
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,662
>> LANA: Ooh, and no.

770
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,964
Because she isn't here.

771
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:22,665
>> CYRIL: Oh!

772
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,000
Damn it, Archer!

773
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,034
Damn you!

774
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:26,002
You can't even let me pretend to

775
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,203
be magnanimous while inwardly

776
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:28,270
gloating!

777
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,138
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up.

778
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,439
What does the note say?

779
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,009
>> LANA (reading):

780
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,048
So, airport?

781
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,116
>> PAM: But the note says not...

782
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,117
(mumbling)

783
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,984
>> CYRIL: Well, I guess that

784
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:42,685
settles that!

785
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,686
I mean, it's not like we can

786
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,054
just waltz into enemy territory

787
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,355
and...

788
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,024
Well, I certainly can't.

789
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,291
>> LANA: Can't, or...

790
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:50,993
>> CYRIL: Both, either, all.

791
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:52,661
They'd shoot me on sight, Lana.

792
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:53,662
And if you want Archer so damn

793
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,464
bad, you can go get him your...

794
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,034
(tires squealing)

795
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,537
Huh.

796
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,571
I didn't think she'd actually

797
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:03,472
do it.

798
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,540
>> MALORY: Then you're an idiot.

799
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,643
>> CYRIL: Oh, I'm the idiot?

800
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,645
>> MALORY: Yes.

801
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:10,513
(Archer grunts)

802
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:11,514
>> ARCHER: What the...?

803
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,515
Holly?

804
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:13,516
>> HOLLY: Archer?

805
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,517
>> SLATER: Rando?

806
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,518
>> ARCHER: Slater?

807
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,886
>> HOLLY: Who the hell is Rando?

808
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,653
>> SLATER: Him!

809
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:18,521
>> HOLLY: That's Sterling

810
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,388
Archer!

811
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,389
>> CHERLENE (loudly): A-hem!

812
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,425
And I am Cherlene?

813
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,428
The Queen of Outlaw Country?

814
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,529
>> SLATER: What the hell are you

815
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:27,530
doing here?

816
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:28,531
>> ARCHER: What the hell are <i>you</i>

817
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,365
doing here?

818
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,266
>> HOLLY: I could ask you the

819
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,167
same question.

820
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,234
I  <i>am</i>asking you the same

821
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,102
question!

822
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:34,036
>> ARCHER: We came to join the

823
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:34,703
rebels.

824
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:35,538
>> SLATER: What?

825
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,539
>> ARCHER: What's the FBI doing

826
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,606
in San Marcos?

827
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,208
With a cocaine smuggler?

828
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,209
(Holly sighs)

829
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,610
>> HOLLY: I'm not FBI, and he's

830
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:42,678
not a...

831
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,946
>> SLATER: Well, technically,

832
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,014
I am, but...

833
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,182
>> HOLLY: We're both CIA.

834
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:47,283
>> ARCHER: What?!

835
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:48,451
>> CHERLENE (whispering): C...

836
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,952
I... A.

837
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:50,686
>> SLATER: And we're also

838
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,687
the rebels.

839
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,389
>> HOLLY: And you are in a <i>mundo</i>

840
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,623
of   <i>caca.</i>

841
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,524
>> LANA: Okay!

842
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:58,094
Listen, stop, listen to me!

843
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,128
>> ARCHER: Lana?!

844
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,062
>> LANA: Holly?

845
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:01,063
What's the FBI doing...

846
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:01,931
>> ARCHER: These dickheads

847
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,366
aren't FBI, Lana, they're CIA!

848
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,936
And also the rebels!

849
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,940
