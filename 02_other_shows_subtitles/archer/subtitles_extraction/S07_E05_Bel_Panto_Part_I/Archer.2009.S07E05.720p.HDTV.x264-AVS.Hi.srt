00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:39,341
Sterling Archer.

165
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:40,391
Hello. Pardon me.

166
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,311
Or move, basically.

167
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:44,231
Good evening, Archbishop.

168
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,251
Could you hold this for me?

169
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,311
Pardon me. Yep. S-Sorry.

170
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,421
That was my hand.

171
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,361
Jesus, glad I'm not allergic to mink.

172
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,341
- Right?
- Hm?

173
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:55,422
Oh, hi. Uh, so sorry. I thought

174
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,301
you were Commodore Perry.

175
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,281
[grumbling] Oh, how dare you!

176
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:01,241
Remember the Maine!

177
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,321
[woman] Couple things.

178
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,261
A, Perry opened Japan to the West.

179
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,401
He died 40 years before
the sinking of the Maine,

180
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:10,251
the cause of which... spoiler alert...

181
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:13,321
has since been proven to
be improper coal storage,

182
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:15,361
not a Spanish harbor mine.

183
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,221
And two...

184
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,211
he didn't have sideburns.

185
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,221
Did he not?

186
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,381
[chuckles] No.

187
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:24,261
He was totally... [slurps]

188
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,301
completely... [slurps]

189
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:30,391
clean... [slurps]

190
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,271
shaven.

191
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,261
Wow. Talk about smooth sailing.

192
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:38,201
It was clearly the Age of Steam.

193
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:40,271
Hi. Sterling Archer.

194
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:42,311
What the... That little bitch!

195
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:45,221
Oh, you're way prettier than her.

196
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:46,231
I meant Archer.

197
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,231
And also, dahoy.

198
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:50,291
[loud munching]

199
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:53,201
- Oh!
- Shut up!

200
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,331
Excuse me. Pardon me. Think
you're gonna flirt...

201
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,401
Hello. Right in front of me...

202
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,431
Hi. With some C-list C-word!

203
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,221
[man] Impossible.

204
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:01,241
Huh?

205
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,211
My dear, how can this be?

206
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:05,261
How have you never
been in one of my pictures?

207
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:07,361
Hm. Because I'm not an actress?

208
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,421
Huh. In what sense?

209
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,431
Every.

210
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:13,201
Perhaps we should begin anew.

211
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,211
Ellis Crane, Academy Award winner.

212
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,291
Lana Kane, private investigator.

213
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,321
You're kidding.

214
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,321
No, so if you ever have

215
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:23,341
anything that needs private
investigating...

216
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,291
I thought you were a producer.

217
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,361
Uh, I produce results.

218
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,201
[groans] Idiot!

219
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,271
How was that my fault?

220
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,201
How is everything your fault?

221
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:34,321
[Pam] Aw, leave him alone.

222
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,391
He's not the one trying
to shuck your lady-corn.

223
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,391
My what?

224
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,371
Oh, so that's how it is now, huh?

225
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:44,381
Well, then you can tell Lana that
two can play at that game.

226
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:45,421
Where's Veronica Deane?

227
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:47,311
[chuckles] How should I know?

228
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:50,231
Y... Because you're
supposed to be guarding her.

229
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,431
I'm also supposed to be pooling tips.

230
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:56,281
Which I haven't gotten any yet, so...

231
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,281
Hey, Ray! You getting any tips?

232
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:01,231
- Hang on!
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

233
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,281
[grunts] Idiot!

234
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,231
What's up her bleached asshole?

235
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:07,211
Okay, so, I've been
watching like a hawk,

236
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,351
and here's the
whats... Lana's pissed at Archer

237
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:10,693
'cause she thought he was macking on

238
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,361
Bleached Asshole, and
she's pissed at Archer

239
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:14,261
'cause she thought he
was a Hollywood honcho

240
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,201
like ol' Whitey Crane over there,

241
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,331
who is macking on Lana, who's
totally full of crap

242
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,785
'cause deep down, she's totally

243
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,331
buyin' into Whitey's bullshit.

244
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,353
So to get back at her, Archer's gonna

245
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,321
pretend to mack on, but not really,

246
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,694
'cause deep down, he's got a

247
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,311
real-life crush-boner for her,

248
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,381
Veronica Deane!

249
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,381
Who we're supposed to be guarding.

250
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:33,331
Well, "whom," but yeah.

251
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,261
And she is...

252
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,341
I don't know who she's into.

253
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,241
I meant, where is she?

254
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,281
How should I know?

255
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,371
Yeah, who is she, Kate Warne?

256
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,371
- What?
- Anyway,

257
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,301
I don't want to jinx it,

258
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:48,371
but this might end up... [ominous
voice] a murder mystery.

259
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,421
Well, fingers crossed.

260
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,261
- Clump!
- [others gasp]

261
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:53,371
Aah...

262
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,402
[shatters]

263
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:04,877
[Archer grunting] Okay.
Okay, here we go.

264
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,937
[clears throat] Hello?

265
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,798
Excuse me, Miss Deane?

266
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:14,927
Yes?

267
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,877
[gulps]

268
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,957
I have tinnitus.

269
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,907
[Pam] Why do we have to clean it up?

270
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,907
Her dumb ass broke the damn thing.

271
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,897
Well, he's the one
sneaking around, scaring people

272
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:25,967
like Casper the Ghost.

273
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,977
A... Casper was the Friendly Ghost.

274
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,937
Well, take a page from his book.

275
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:34,877
You ever wonder how Casper died?

276
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,907
When you're finished here, un-clump!

277
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,957
'Cause my theory is Casper and Spooky

278
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,907
were kidnapped, raped, and murdered...

279
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,017
by Stevie.

280
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,967
Wow, that sounds pretty dark.

281
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,807
No, Miss Kane, not dark.

282
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,917
Noir.

283
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,897
- I...
- Or nouveau noir, if you must,

284
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:53,997
but rest assured, my dear,

285
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,977
Deadly Velvet will redefine the genre.

286
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,937
Of the private-eye movie?

287
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,151
[gasps]

288
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:01,807
[imitates arrow whooshing]

289
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:02,937
[grunts]

290
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:04,817
Um, are you...

291
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:05,967
Madam, you wound me.

292
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,897
[grunts]

293
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:10,897
Deadly Velvet is going to
be a cinematic tour de force,

294
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:13,837
and I want you deeply involved.

295
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,017
Well, but I haven't
been a private investigator

296
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:17,787
for very long.

297
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:18,897
Had Shocking Blue been a band

298
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,907
very long before they recorded "Venus"?

299
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:21,927
- I...
- No.

300
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:22,957
I don't know.

301
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,987
We can't know.

302
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,957
And speaking of not knowing...

303
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,957
what does a technical advisor even do?

304
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,917
Well, advise on
technical matters, of course,

305
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,847
but I think you could also help me

306
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:35,887
really get inside the
mind of the private detective.

307
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:39,887
What... makes... her... tick.

308
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:41,887
Oh, wow, it's a female lead?

309
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,807
What? [laughing]

310
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:45,867
Oh, God, no.

311
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,797
What does Lana think she's doing?

312
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:49,947
Well, I think she's...

313
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,787
She's embarrassing herself. That's what.

314
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:52,987
Fawning all over Ellis Crane.

315
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,847
Trying to make Archer...

316
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,977
When he's clearly much better suited

317
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,937
for a woman like, well,

318
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:58,977
me.

319
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,797
Jealous. Hey, how's Ron?

320
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:02,907
He's great.

321
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:05,807
How's nobody?

322
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,987
[laughing]

323
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,817
You're gon...

324
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:10,888
[laughing]

325
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,987
I [bleep] you on a blimp.

326
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,937
[laughing]

327
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,917
Oh, my God!

328
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,987
That's right.

329
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:22,017
Man, what ever happened to blimps?

00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,481
No, sorry for that.

498
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:00,581
Why did you do that?

499
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,045
What? That... That's how you do it.

500
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,551
You could have just tied him up.

501
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,421
With what? And also, no, I couldn't.

502
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:08,521
That only works in the movies.

503
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,351
He would've gotten loose or yelled or...

504
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,401
Well, shooting him would've
been better than that.

505
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,441
Not for him. Plus it's really loud,

506
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,511
and I actually do have tinnitus, so...

507
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,491
Where did you learn that, the army?

508
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:23,277
[chuckling] What? No, no, God, no.

509
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,491
But, I mean, don't get me wrong.

510
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,441
I truly appreciate the sacrifices

511
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,491
of the men and women who
serve in our armed forces,

512
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,590
but there's easier ways to almost

513
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,441
be eligible for food stamps.

514
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,501
It is just criminal what they get paid.

515
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:36,511
Although, I'd probably be an officer.

516
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,571
- [zipping fabric]
- Still, though...

517
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,531
seems like a lot of running.

518
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,371
And now if you'll excuse me,

519
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,411
I'm going to go kill some evil clowns.

520
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,571
[fabric scrunches]

521
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,391
Do you...

522
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,491
have an erection?

523
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,352
No.

524
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:52,582
No.

525
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,265
[string quartet]

526
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:07,205
[Shapiro groaning]

527
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:08,295
There he is.

528
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:10,085
[groaning continues]

529
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:11,205
How you doing, bub?

530
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:12,295
Uh, who...

531
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,195
Whuzza...

532
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,225
Where... What happened?

533
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,247
Oh, my God, what didn't happen?

534
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:19,884
Well, for starters,

535
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,225
you're a one-hitter quitter.

536
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,265
[groans] Wait. How long was I out?

537
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,265
Hm, like five hours?

538
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,392
Oh, that is not good.

539
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,155
Uh, no. [chuckles]

540
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:30,525
You're gonna want a brain scan,

541
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,275
you know, if we don't get murdered.

542
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,065
Which...

543
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,125
[gasps] Veronica!

544
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:36,125
Where's Veronica?

545
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,275
That's the thing.

546
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,135
Nobody knows.

547
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,145
And these guys are losing their shit.

548
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,255
Well, they're under a lot of stress.

549
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:44,135
Don't start.

550
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:46,105
Because somehow, some stupid idiot

551
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,265
must've called 911.

552
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,075
[Pam] And so about a jillion
cops showed up,

553
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,185
so then it was a full-on siege.

554
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,215
And then after that, the head clown...

555
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:56,245
[giggles] Mr. Rompers.

556
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:58,075
He's awesome.

557
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:59,265
And he was like, "This blows dicks.

558
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,175
The bathroom situation's a nightmare.

559
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:03,095
I'm making an executive decision.

560
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,235
This is too many hostages."

561
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,215
And so then they let everyone go.

562
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:08,295
Wait, what? Everybody?

563
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:11,285
Well, except for kinda...

564
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:15,115
- the core group.
- [Malory groans]

565
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,235
Oh, and the band, which...

566
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:20,145
Good job, guys! Doing great!

567
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,563
Goddamn it!

568
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,165
What did I say about running your mouth?

569
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,245
Sorry, that was my jam.

570
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:30,185
[inhales] Hey, Mr. Rompers.

571
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,175
Shut... up!

572
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,075
Everybody!

573
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:35,105
[grumbling]

574
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,075
Wait, so did...

575
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,095
Shut up.

576
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,145
Pam, tell him the best part.

577
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,235
Wh... That is the least best part.

578
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,065
- Tell him!
- [sighs]

579
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,095
So Cheryl here...

580
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:45,235
- [clears throat]
- I'm sorry.

581
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:49,115
Tania here has decided she's
got Stockholm Syndrome.

582
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,275
And soon I will be Mrs. Rompers.

583
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:54,175
Again, that's if we don't get murdered.

584
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:55,215
[gun cocks]

585
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:57,116
Shh.

586
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,126
Which...
