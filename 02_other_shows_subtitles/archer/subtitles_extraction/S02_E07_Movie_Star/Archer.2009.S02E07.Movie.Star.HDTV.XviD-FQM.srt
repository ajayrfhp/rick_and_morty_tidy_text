1
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:09,233
She's battled ivory poachers,
raging rivers, even tuberculosis...

2
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:13,807
and now Oscar-winner Rona Thorne
takes on the CIA and the KGB

3
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,421
in Dietrich Viener's
new thriller "Disavowed!"

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:19,541
Ohmigod it's going
to be amazing,

5
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,899
I play a spy
accused of being a double-agent

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,253
so she has to clear her name and I
read Dietrich's script and I was like,

7
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:28,756
lookit me,
I was like "waaaaagh!"

8
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,575
so it's just going to be amazing.

9
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,027
Oh my God,
she's amazing!

10
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,528
Eh, I dunno...

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,584
That's because you're an
idiot...

12
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:37,731
Who obviously never
saw "River's Rage."

13
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:39,800
I saw it,
but I was just like "ehh."

14
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,350
Wh-? ! Are you nuts?!

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,251
That scene when her
baby gets swept away?!

16
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,225
Bawled so hard they made me
leave the theater, never saw the ending.

17
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:47,230
Well, they find
the baby...

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,615
Aaah! Don't tell me!

19
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,508
- Dead.
- Dammit!

20
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:52,781
Yeah, jammed up
under a log...

21
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:55,617
Oh and that wet clingy shirt
she wears the whole time?!

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,199
Nippletooown!

23
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,856
Ohmigod
that river was so... Cold!

24
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,024
Waaaaagh!

25
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,328
Waaaaagh!
Why? ! Are we screaming?!

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,229
Do you know who you are?!

27
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,369
I dooo!

28
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:10,501
I do I do I do and I'm also supposed
to be meeting Malory Archer?

29
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,897
Come in dear, come in...

30
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,737
And the rest of you, don't you
have something better to do

31
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:18,398
than stand around all day and...
shriek?

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,681
- No.
- Noooope.

33
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:22,129
I'm sorry,
that sounded like no.

34
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,452
Lana, she has to
research her role...

35
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,834
This isn't, whatever, the
sheriff's department

36
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,343
where you get to wear a windbreaker
and go on a ride-along.

37
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,657
This is highly-classified
covert ops...

38
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,428
Yes! Covert ops!

39
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,043
That's exactly the kind of
spy lingo I want to soak up!

40
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:38,638
What part of "highly-classified"
do you not understand?

41
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:39,838
All of it!

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,574
That's why I'm here doing
research, so you can teach me!

43
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:44,009
Which she
will be happy to do.

44
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,378
Wait a minute.

45
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,579
What're you getting out of this?

46
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:47,848
Wh-? Nothing!

47
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,881
Well, apart from a small
consideration from the studio...

48
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,870
Uh-huh.

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,505
Which we're still
negotiating, but...

50
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,557
Who's your agent, by the way?

51
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:59,729
He's not taking new clients, and Lana
please, you have to have to have to help me.

52
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,697
No I don't don't don't,
and I'm not...

53
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,066
Not really qualified.

54
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:03,863
I'm sorry?

55
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:07,838
It's not your fault, Lana.
I on the other hand, am qualified,

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,620
since I happen to be the
world's greatest secret agent.

57
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,696
- But... you're a man.
- And then some.

58
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,381
So obviously he can't give you
a woman's perspective like I can,

59
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:18,565
- so yes, I will be happy to help you.
- Wh-?!

60
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,653
Ohmigod this is
gonna be amaaazing!

61
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,213
You're just doing this
to spite me!

62
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,793
And?

63
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:37,988
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

64
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,782
I should be teaching Rona
Thorne how to be a secret agent.

65
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,550
Not Lana.

66
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,800
"Woman's perspective."

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,255
I mean, I'm so obviously the best agent,
duh, how could she pick Lana over me?!

68
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,923
The mind
fairly boggles.

69
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,325
Exactly!

70
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,417
- Wait, was that sarcasm?
- No, sir.

71
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,860
Oh good.
Because your opinion matters.

72
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,399
And since you seem unclear on
the concept, that was sarcasm.

73
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,466
Well played, sir.

74
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:24,901
Thank you.

75
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,088
Thank you.

76
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,777
But the minute this interferes with
my real assignments, we're finished.

77
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,914
Ohmigod totally yes, I mean I'm just
acting but your work is so, so vital!

78
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,083
Well... I mean no,
it is, but...

79
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,674
No! Don't do that,
I am so, lookit me, I am so.

80
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,088
Inspired by you!

81
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,723
I... really?

82
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,399
Ohmigod, you are like, the
epitome of an empowered woman,

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,831
and if I can bring even a tenth of your
strength and sexiness to my character?

84
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,799
Oh my God!

85
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,333
Yer kidding.

86
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:57,701
And just exactly
what is so funny?

87
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,920
I... no, it's just...

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,038
It's just kinda hard
to picture you as a young actress...

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,005
For your information...

90
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,373
A young anything...

91
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,643
My acting career,
shut up, was really taking off.

92
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,946
In fact, I was on my way to a
callback for a TV commercial,

93
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:15,186
doing the crossword on the 41 bus, and a man
leans over and says "If you like puzzles,

94
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,156
I may have a job for you,"
and guess who he was.

95
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,858
Wild Bill Donovan...

96
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,961
Wild Bill Donovan,
head of the OSS!

97
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,794
Three weeks later I was in
Tunisia, killing a man.

98
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:30,970
But I always wondered, what if I
had gotten that commercial...?

99
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,072
Guess that
Tunisian guy'd still be alive...

100
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:38,844
He was German, and this character,
Gerald Martin, the CIA director,

101
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,279
why couldn't that
be Geraldine Martin?

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,682
No, that's awful, um...
ooh, Malory!

103
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:49,156
But not Martin, something like Steele,
because she's a very strong woman who...

104
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,483
Who will remember that
at bonus time!

105
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:58,213
And she's also having a torrid affair
with one of the sexy young agents...

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,133
Who's black.

107
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,235
Waaaagh!

108
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:07,006
Ohmigod that is amaaazing!

109
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,808
And that
was a lot better...

110
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,876
at least that time you fired
downrange.

111
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:14,579
And ohmigod seriously, I am so like,
like, really super sorry about that.

112
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,521
Totally my fault.

113
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,216
Please go buy a new suit at
Bergdorf's and send the bill to my manager.

114
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,018
Thanks, I will
take you up on that...

115
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,662
Right after I go to the hospital.

116
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:26,591
Ohmigod if I like, possessed
the capacity to be embarrassed?

117
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,193
Eh. I shouldn't have started
you off with a fully-auto.

118
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,373
Let's see what we have
in a semi-automatic...

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Well, that's no good...

120
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,868
What's not?

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,303
ARCHER Your stance,
you're fighting yourself.

122
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,354
Excuse me?
ARCHER You're all rigid and stiff.

123
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,508
Which I'm all for, rimshot,
but not on the range.

124
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,744
You have to relax, let the weapon
be an extension of your body...

125
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,442
Oh my God...

126
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,950
Aw, I meant to make
a frowny face...

127
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,388
But hey, speaking of your body,
and my body, and stiffness...

128
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,591
What the hell, Lana?!

129
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,059
Oh, I bet that really hurt, didn't it?

130
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,462
What?

131
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,399
Yeah ha ha ha,
grown-ups,

132
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,268
keep moving your lips
without making any... any...

133
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,570
Maahp. Mah mah mahp. Maaaahp!

134
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,522
Excuse me.

135
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,207
Can you believe
I used to date him?

136
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,926
- Yes.
- And... wait, what?

137
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,878
And I bet he cheated on you just like
I bet every one of your boyfriends has,

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,445
going all the way back to...

139
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,626
Sorry, but I assume you were
just an insanely gawky teenager?

140
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,899
There was some mild
gawkiness, but...

141
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,120
Which you've never gotten over,
which is why, please don't hate me,

142
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,622
you're like, teeming
with insecurities...

143
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,929
- Wh-? ! No I'm not!
- When you totally shouldn't be!

144
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:37,594
You're gorgeous and smart and... ohmigod,
have you read "UnleasUnhing the Me"?!

145
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,162
By Reinhart Schmoll?!

146
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,726
You have to read it!

147
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,932
Take my copy, it'll
change your life and...

148
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:46,181
Oh! And you have to start keeping a
journal of...

149
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:48,540
Hey, where's my journal?

150
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,509
Umm... I maybe kinda
slightly... took it.

151
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,459
Why why why,
would you do that?!

152
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,486
Didja
think it was meat?

153
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:58,814
I... shut up... I just wanted, ya
know, to see what she's really like.

154
00:06:58,816 --> 00:06:59,809
Give me that!

155
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,385
Little Miss... Invasion of the
Privacy Snatchers!

156
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,548
Oh, come on!

157
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:06,055
Haven't you ever snooped on
somebody you thought was dreamy?

158
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,226
No!

159
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:11,661
Well, except Randy Trexler, who turns out was
just leading me on to get out of the draft

160
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:16,151
so I made a phone call to the draft board, and
now who's laughing, Mr. Hooks for Hands?!

161
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,928
A booby trap blew his arms off.

162
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,828
They said it was in a coconut!

163
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,523
Mahp! Mmahp. Mmahp.

164
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,494
Hi, yeah, please!
Keep gawking at the deaf person!

165
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:30,987
Deaf people
are gross.

166
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,698
Not as gross as
the hook-hand ones.

167
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,401
Eh. I dunno.

168
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,252
<i>Mahp. Maaahp.</i>

169
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,079
Yeah, quit doing that?

170
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:42,607
Mahp, what?

171
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:43,856
Stop? Not helping?

172
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,838
Is that helping?
Frickin Lana,

173
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,899
even for her, this is over the line.

174
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:50,336
She is gonna wish
I was never born.

175
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,156
Just gonna
softball it in like that?

176
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:53,990
ARCHER Mahp, what?

177
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:54,838
I'm sorry?

178
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,823
I said come in here,
I need your help.

179
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,761
But I'm on my way
to a SexAnon meeting.

180
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:00,663
Which is
exactly why I need you!

181
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,155
You... oh no,
please Ms. Archer,

182
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,968
Don't flatter yourself!

183
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,639
I'm talking about this,
the script for "Disavowed"!

184
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:13,243
"Cut to Malory Steele, the fiftyish
and incredibly sexy CIA director..."

185
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:14,589
spy comedy?

186
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:15,650
Wh-? No!

187
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,771
Because that has
been done.

188
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,772
It's a taut,
sexy thriller!

189
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:23,119
Or it will be, if I can just get all the
taut, sexy bits in the right order.

190
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,853
Yikes yeah, you can't have a
flashback with a flash-forward in it,

191
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,983
- That's where you come in.
- That's bad writing.

192
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,285
Because I wangled a
call with the studio execs,

193
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:35,131
and I think I can sell them on
a rewrite, if you... fix it.

194
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,027
Well for starters, I don't
think you wanna say this guy is

195
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:41,169
"as coal black and thick-muscled
as a field hand."

196
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,172
I don't need you for
content, just for plot structure!

197
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:47,675
But racist overtones aside, it
really kinda limits your casting options.

198
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,548
I mean, only two, three guys
could play that.

199
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:53,862
You just have to find the right guy,
who's not intimidated by your power.

200
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,207
Or my twin TEC-9's...

201
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,399
Or those big, steam-shovelly
scoops you call hands.

202
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,599
I'm kidding!

203
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:02,278
Look, lookit me, that's the gawky
six-foot teenager everybody cheats on,

204
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:05,274
not the embodiment of sexy empowered
womanhood that you've become!

205
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,199
Ya really think
I'm sexy and empowered?

206
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,578
Wh-? You're like a...
brown Boudicca!

207
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,947
Who I wrote an amazing poem about in...

208
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,201
Damn, I wish I could find my journal!

209
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:19,094
So then it's settled, we're a go
on Operation...What should we call it?

210
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:20,427
Dick Sledge.

211
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,501
You wanna...?

212
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:26,064
No, but it's like sour milk,
ya just gotta take a whiff.

213
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,100
What's the story, neckbonenes?

214
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:31,605
Sophomore year at my stupid
college I had a huge crush on the quarterback,

215
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:33,611
this super-hot guy named
Dick Sledge...

216
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:34,745
- Sploosh.
- Jinx.

217
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,099
... but it was like
I was invisible,

218
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,467
he wouldn't even sign my cast
when I broke my own arm.

219
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:43,515
But I thought if I knew what he liked I'd have
an in, so one Saturday when he had a game

220
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:47,351
I broke into his dorm room to see what
kinda music he was into, or turtles,

221
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,653
or roll around in his clothes,
or whatever, but...

222
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,932
But you were so busy sniffin his
jock you didn't hear him come in...

223
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,191
Because
he totally snuck up on me!

224
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,760
Then I guess I blacked out because I
don't remember stabbing him at all.

225
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,329
Wh-? ! Why'd you have
a knife?!

226
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,205
I didn't!

227
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,243
It was a stupid pair of scissors,

228
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:05,058
and it was his fault for grabbing
me with his throwing hand!

229
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,203
That's how his tendon
got severed!

230
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,538
Holy shitsnacks.

231
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,145
Yeah, they said
he could've gone pro.

232
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:14,443
So, glossing over why
you broke your own arm...

233
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,578
So he'd sign
my cast.

234
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,430
What exactly
is your point?

235
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,281
Duh.

236
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,575
Just break into Rona's apartment and
put her stupid journal somewhere.

237
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:23,820
Hey yeah!

238
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,055
Nooope!

239
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:25,734
Why not?

240
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:28,086
Because it's just not
believable that this guy...

241
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:31,292
who, also, can not be named
Cassius...

242
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,864
would risk his career
for a woman twice his age!

243
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,206
So make her forty!

244
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,832
Yeah,
and who's gonna play her?!

245
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,902
Wh-? Me!
That's the whole point!

246
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,618
You do realize there's a finite
supply of Vaseline in the universe!

247
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,396
Type! Nerd.

248
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,935
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said
that, mahp, but I'm under a lot of stress.

249
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:49,044
Oh oh, and we're not?!

250
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:52,290
Ya got any idea how
much I got on my plate?!

251
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,050
What, I coulda
crushed that!

252
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,511
Now c'mon, let me help.
Whatcha got?

253
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:59,111
Well, we're picking up chatter
about a bomb threat in the Middle East...

254
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,740
Who cares?!
I'm talking local, guys!

255
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,596
Yes, yes!
See, this is...

256
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,763
Wow, singlespaced, wanna
broad-stroke it for me?

257
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,817
Kolchenko, the new Soviet premier,
is scheduled to give a speech at the UN

258
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:17,069
in favor of strategic arms limitations
talks, but the hardliners in the KGB...

259
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,689
Who am I, Kissinger?!
Broad strokes!

260
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,672
The KGB is gonna shoot this
prick as he walks into the UN.

261
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,439
- And?
- And what?

262
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,617
Was that so hard?
Count Snackula?

263
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:32,507
No, shut up, we go in, drop
the journal, and get out. No snooping.

264
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:36,026
Aw c'mon, I just wanna see if me and
her have any stuff in common, like...

265
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,989
Tons of cockporn
laying around?

266
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,931
I don't have cockporn
just layin around!

267
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,220
But sometimes, ya know,
you forget it's in the VCR!

268
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,057
How do you forget?

269
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:47,917
Ya rub one out, flip back to
regular TV, "Superstars" is on,

270
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:52,998
and all of a sudden here's Joe Frazier's dumb
ass drowning, and ya forget it's in there!

271
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,116
Until mom and dad come to visit to tell
ya she's got Lou Gehrig's disease.

272
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,252
Why would you think
it's O.K. to share that?

273
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,020
Why are you idiots
in the armory?

274
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,288
And gimme those!

275
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,389
Hey, we're using those!

276
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,473
No you're not!

277
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,307
All this equipment is for
field operatives only.

278
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,919
Now beat it, ladies,
I'm on a mission.

279
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,254
You're not
our supervisor!

280
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,195
And, shut up,
we're on a mission too!

281
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:17,597
We're breaking into Rona's
apartment to hide the stupid journal Pam stole.

282
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,665
You're kidding.

283
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,497
- No.
- Yes.

284
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:22,702
There's a sniper out there, whose
bullet could spark World War Three,

285
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:26,171
and you idiots are tying up ISIS
resources on high school bullshit?!

286
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:27,088
- Yes.
- No.

287
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,475
Because I don't really see
a downside to that, Archer-wise.

288
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:31,010
Here, load up.

289
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:33,125
Should be a big box of grenades
around here somewhere.

290
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,416
Where? ! Tell me where Pinch
Two is supposed to go, and I'll...

291
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:37,315
Act Two!

292
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:41,035
Act Two is wall-to-wall with this
love story you're making me shoehorn into...

293
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:45,037
The forbidden love between Malory
and Cassius is central to the plot!

294
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:49,798
Oh for the... Why dontcha just make
it a shot-for-shot remake of Mandingo!

295
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:54,732
Hate to interrupt, but
I'm off on a dangerous mission!

296
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,394
That's what people
wanna see!

297
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,474
Not "Granny Gets Jungle Fever."

298
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,294
Get out!

299
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:04,880
But even though it's super-dangerous,
I'm preventing World War Three, so...

300
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:05,677
Wait, what?!

301
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:09,046
Hm? Nothing,
no big deal, excuse me. Excuse me.

302
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,637
- Nooope.
- Ohmigod strong and sexy, amaazing!

303
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:13,446
Will you shut up?!

304
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:18,077
And if you don't mind, I have to stop KGB
snipers from assassinating the Soviet premier

305
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,461
as he enters the UN.

306
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:21,743
- Now there's a Pinch Two!
- Yeah, that's pretty good...

307
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:22,888
You're not
taking this mission.

308
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,876
You never qualified
as a countersniper!

309
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,200
I... would have!

310
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:33,590
Ya know,
if I'd gone to the... thing.

311
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,876
Yeah, well, if your aunt
had balls she'd be your uncle.

312
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:37,540
- What?
- There's your Pinch Two!

313
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,277
So I'll just be
taking these...

314
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:40,270
And me!

315
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,187
Nooope!

316
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,381
Lana, please this
is perfect for my role!

317
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,872
You have to have to have to!

318
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,363
No, this is the real
thing, Rona.

319
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,510
Which is why
it's a job for a man.

320
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,428
Which is why shut up because I, and
Rona, am and are taking the mission!

321
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,531
Ohmigod,
this is gonna be...

322
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,852
Don't! Say it!
I swear to God!

323
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,004
Amaaazing.

324
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:04,409
Isn't this amazing?

325
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:05,806
Not really, no.

326
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:07,907
Actually kinda wish I'd let
Archer take this one...

327
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,053
But we're like, keeping the
world free for democracy or whatever!

328
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:15,050
Not if I can't take out the KGB
sniper team, God knows where they are...

329
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,520
There's about a bajillion
hide-sites around here...

330
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,655
And a hidden transmitter
in your rifle scope.

331
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:22,105
You dumb idiot?

332
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:22,957
I'm sorry?

333
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,726
You should be!

334
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,194
Look, I took this call as
a courtesy to Rona, okay?

335
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:30,151
Which now I'm regretting, because
what kinda facacta bullshit is this?!

336
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:32,400
"Disavowed" is a spy thriller!

337
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:34,403
Well, which is why we
want to change the title, to...

338
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,839
To what,
"Mandingo Two"?!

339
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:39,318
Wait, hang on, hang on, Jeannie?!

340
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:42,145
Anybody doing a
"Mandingo" sequel?!

341
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,723
When can you get me a treatment?

342
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,970
- I, I...
- Two weeks.

343
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,996
Ya got a week, we're calling
it "Mandingo Two, The Enslavening!"

344
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:51,841
Well, Cyril? We did it.

345
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,651
Yeah we kinda did,
didn't we?

346
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,122
A taut, sexy thriller...

347
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:02,629
Oh yes, take me!
Take me, Cassius!

348
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,124
Ohmigod Lana,
you seem really tense.

349
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:06,811
You know what I do
when I'm tense?

350
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:08,400
No, but I bet
you're gonna tell us...

351
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,030
- Kelp tape!
- What?

352
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,085
It's amazing, these like, kung-fu
monks make this fifty-foot tape,

353
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:17,352
like a cloth measuring tape but it's kelp,
and you swallow it over like three days

354
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,726
then you start to, ya know,
pass it,

355
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:23,400
then you just slowly slowly pull it
out of you over three more days...

356
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,216
Wait, what?

357
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:29,324
And it pulls all the toxins out of
your body and you just feel so clean!

358
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:34,230
Yeah? While you're tangled up
in a half-mile of shit-covered tape?

359
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,199
Frickin actresses.

360
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,754
Okay, time for a little
tension-relief of my own...

361
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,467
And you know what else is
great, colonics...

362
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:46,744
Will you shut up, I gotta window opening
up at... dammit, there's another one!

363
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,011
This is so exciiiiting!

364
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,720
And another one, shit,
and another!

365
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,813
But that's not all!

366
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,613
If you order now,
you'll also receive...

367
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,311
No way!

368
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:59,055
Yup. He's down.

369
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,752
But not forgotten.

370
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:06,169
Come, Kreigerbots!
Avenge your fallen comrade!

371
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,405
What voice is that?
Is that from ***?

372
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:10,432
Dammit,
they're everywhere!

373
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,600
There's too many,
I can't...

374
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,368
Lemme help,
tell me how to help!

375
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,692
Shut up and grab that spotter
scope, and tell me where they are!

376
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,942
Okay, there's a nice
way to do that.

377
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,911
Will you just...?!

378
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:24,387
Okay, there's a, wait, no that's
a... ohmigod I can see my penthouse!

379
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:26,146
Well unless there's
a sniper in it...

380
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,818
Well somebody's in it!

381
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:30,480
Who the [BEEP] is in my
penthouse?!

382
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,444
We are!
We're complying,

383
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:34,141
You! Get yer
frickin hands up!

384
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,580
You're not
my supervisor!

385
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,151
Shut up,
we're gonna go to prison!

386
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,755
No we're not,
just say the right stuff

387
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,293
and they just send you
to a mental hospital for ten months.

388
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,572
I just this second realized
why you do macramé instead of knitting.

389
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,283
Yeah, no
sharp objects on the ward.

390
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:47,838
They were super
strict about that.

391
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:50,974
She's got a weapon,
drop it, drop it!

392
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,184
You're
not my supervisor!!

393
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:55,170
God Damn him!

394
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,777
I told him no parties!

395
00:16:56,897 --> 00:16:59,787
- Gimme it, gimme!
- Hey, what the shit?! Rona, stop!

396
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:03,083
This is a serious... ow!...
situation.

397
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,663
I know and ohmigod
I am so sorry!

398
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,657
Please please please
don't hate me!

399
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,325
Unghh... what's wrong
with me...?

400
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,260
It's tetrodoxin,
from the fugu fish.

401
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:12,428
Whuh?!

402
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,831
- Yeah, what?!
- I'm a Russian sleeper, silly!

403
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,115
Jesus Lana, how did
you not see that?!

404
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:25,510
Oh, I never got to tell this.

405
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,704
Well, my parents were
sleepers in L.A.

406
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:30,914
- still are, love them - and we were
encouraged to, ya know, blend,

407
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,433
and so I ended up
being an actress.

408
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:40,891
Ohmigod I know, but the lengths
they go to, lookit me, you have no idea.

409
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,699
Is my new favorite device
of ever.

410
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:48,436
I mean it, with the scnhozz and the
combover yer a dead ringer for Karl Malden!

411
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,081
C'mon, buddy...

412
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,567
Lana hush.

413
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:59,229
If you sit quietly, the poison should
wear off in like, four hours...

414
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,705
But if you struggle,
your heart could...

415
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:02,714
Freeze!

416
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,549
Wait, where'd she... oww! Shit!

417
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,283
And we wouldn't want that.

418
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,804
- Ammit!-

419
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,757
Ohmigod there's
Kolchenko's motorcade!

420
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,193
This'd be such an amazing
finish for "Disavowed!"

421
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,278
So bummed I won't be able
to work on it now...

422
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:18,597
Ohmigod, on anything!

423
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:20,420
Ohmigod, I won't be famous
anymore!

424
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:24,301
Not in the good way!

425
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,720
Ohmigod, and the money?!

426
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,124
Last year I took home almost
two hundred grand...

427
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,641
In gift bags.

428
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:30,954
- Oh.
- Oh.

429
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,124
Ya think?!

430
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,787
Now some old guys in some
country I've never even been to

431
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:38,152
expect me to throw all that away for
some lame, whatever, ideology?!

432
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:39,380
So on't oo it!

433
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,129
I know, right?
Is that crazy?!

434
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:42,949
- Ess!
- But if I do...

435
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,530
there's some amazing stuff
happening in Soviet cinema...

436
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:48,153
And they promised me
I could direct.

437
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,229
Uh-uhhh...

438
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:53,409
Yeah. Kolchenko's down...
that is so gross!

439
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:57,638
Kelp tape!

440
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,408
And Lana, promise me you'll
try it, especially after this.

441
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,669
It reeally pulls the toxins out.

442
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:06,211
Oh, and please read "The Unleashing
Of Me" and please please please

443
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:07,952
don't beat yourself up over this!

444
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:10,500
You are a sexy, empowered woman!

445
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,519
Mm.

446
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,811
And speaking of, wish me
luck on my directing career!

447
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,216
Which is gonna be...

448
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:16,158
- M-mm!
- Own say it!

449
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,505
