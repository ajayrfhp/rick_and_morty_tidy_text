1
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:06,290
Agent Sterling Archer,
codename Duchess.

2
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:07,890
Licensed to kill.

3
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,794
Primary skills: covert operations.

4
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,028
Unarmed combat.

5
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,062
Firearms.

6
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,130
Explosives.

7
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,764
Asset acquisition.

8
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,533
Enemy agent disposal.

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,968
Current status: missing.

10
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:21,571
MALORY: For three months!

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,012
Sterling's been missing for three
months and you idiots have nothing!

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,021
GILLETTE: Well name-calling's
not gonna get us -- [ BLEEP ]

13
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:32,723
Anywhere.

14
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,224
LANA: Which is where
Archer could be.

15
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,627
Malory, we've checked every safe
house, run down every lead...

16
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:41,432
CYRIL: And he hasn't touched any of his
bank accounts, so unless he... oh.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,735
LANA: Were you gonna say
"unless he's been skimming

18
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:46,271
tons of cash from his operations
accounts all these years"?

19
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,640
CYRIL: Yeah, duh, right?

20
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,609
MALORY: Wh-?
He wouldn't dare steal from me!

21
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:54,213
GILLETTE: Oh please, we all --
think he would dare to do that.

22
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:57,216
LANA: So we've got a g highly-ih
skilled covert agent,

23
00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:00,018
who probably has millions
of dollars in cash...

24
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,821
GILLETTE: Who doesn't
want to be found.

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,492
MALORY: Being looked for by people
who don't want to find him!

26
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,027
EVERYBODY: What does that mean?

27
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:07,061
MALORY: Oh, don't give me that!

28
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,131
You're all secretly
delighted that he's gone!

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,103
LANA: I wouldn't say delighted, but...
GILLETTE: I cannot say I miss

30
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:13,938
the bullying.

31
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:14,639
CYRIL: Me neither.

32
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,842
Plus ISIS actually turned
a profit this quarter.

33
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,079
MALORY: Be that as it -- no, never mind!

34
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,184
Because since you've all been
half-assedly phoning it in --

35
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:24,519
LANA: Malory, he can't!

36
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:25,086
Be found!

37
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:29,459
I mean, if he's even still...um...
MALORY: Still what.

38
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:31,095
CHERYL/CAROL: Aliiive.

39
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:33,064
Jeezow, talk about duh.

40
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,035
I bet he totally already
killed himself.

41
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,103
PAM: No he didn't!

42
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,104
What's wrong with you?!

43
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,105
CHERYL/CAROL: Nothing!

44
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:41,875
Because my skeevy Russian fiance
wasn't murdered in front

45
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:44,112
of my very eyeballs
at my stupid wedding!

46
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,882
ARCHER: Noooooooooooooooooooo!

47
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,216
Kaaatyaaa!

48
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:50,553
Noooo ho ho wah ha haaa!

49
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:51,354
BARRY: Woooooh!

50
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,188
How's it feel, Archer?!

51
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:54,124
Now both our weddings
are canceled!

52
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:57,127
ARCHER: Baarryyyyyyy!

53
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,895
BARRY: Is that how
you crash a wedding?

54
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:03,099
Yes it is, Bionic Barry, yes it is...
MALORY: No!

55
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:07,071
No matter how distraught Sterling is
over Katya, he won't kill himself.

56
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,238
He'd never do that to me.

57
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:10,975
He's alive, somewhere, and
since you fools can't find

58
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:13,577
him I called in someone who can.

59
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:16,680
Say hello to Rip Riley, manhunter.

60
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:17,681
RILEY: Manhunter?

61
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,218
- Now if that is the pot calling
the kettle black... MALORY: Oh Rip,

62
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,121
you old so-and-so!

63
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,122
RILEY: How are you, Malory?

64
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,923
Besides gorgeous?

65
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,591
MALORY: Oh I'm not, I'm a mess!

66
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,929
I'm worried half to death about Sterling, and --
RILEY: Well, don't be.

67
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:30,897
I tracked him down.

68
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:31,798
MALORY: Already?!

69
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:32,365
LANA: Wh-? How?!

70
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:34,601
RILEY: Uh, this new thing
called intelligence gathering?

71
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,172
Anyhoo, he's on a little island
called Wapuni in French Polynesia --

72
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,908
GILLETTE: With his millions in caaaash...
RILEY: Tending bar.

73
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:41,843
GILLETTE: Or nooooot.

74
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,546
RILEY: So I'll pick him up tonight,
then say, three days back to New York,

75
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,116
so if you're not busy Friday night...
MALORY: I'll book us our old

76
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,183
booth at 21.

77
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,451
RILEY: Outstanding.

78
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,185
Riley out.

79
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,387
PAM: What a hunk!

80
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,389
CHERYL/CAROL: Total sploosh.

81
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,559
LANA: Actually yeah, gotta
give him the sploosh.

82
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,195
GILLETTE: And, whatever my
equivalent of sploosh is,

83
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,466
which, I guess is just sploosh.

84
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,568
Only with semen.

85
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:18,956

86
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:45,410
WOMAN: Oh my God, I can't
believe I just did that...

87
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:48,598
You know, I'm not like that --
ARCHER: No, hey c'mon, don't do that...

88
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:51,852
Don't ruin your post-coital bliss
with a bunch of misplaced guilt.

89
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:55,390
WOMAN: How is it misplaced,
I'm on my honeymoo-hooon!

90
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,742
ARCHER: Well at least
you got a honeymoon!

91
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,126
My fiance was murdered!

92
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,528
WOMAN: Wait, what?
ARCHER: Yeah!

93
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,163
Oh! And you married an idiot!

94
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:04,266
Who plays thirty-six holes of golf
on the first day of his honeymoon?

95
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,602
Because not to, whatever, but that
cannot bode well for your marriage.

96
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,171
WOMAN: Get the hell out,
you piece of shit!

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,008
ARCHER: Seriously, I hope she didn't
sign a pre-nup, because -- Oh my God!

98
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:17,011
Hey so, what happened was,
somebody ordered room service,

99
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,913
but the regular room service
guy, uh, he died, so I came in

100
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,716
here and fell on the bed --
Wait, you're not her husband.

101
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,520
And you're not one of my dick
bosses, so can I help you, or...?

102
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,789
RILEY: Yes, you can quickly and
quietly walk down to the dock

103
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,190
and board my seaplane.

104
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,494
ARCHER: Okay A, rhetorical,
and B, your what?

105
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:34,195
RILEY: Seaplane?

106
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,631
Looks like an airplane
had a baby with a boat?

107
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,433
ARCHER: I know what a
seaplane is, idiot!

108
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:40,235
RILEY: And yet you're
surprisingly unclear on the

109
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:41,637
phrase "quickly and quietly."

110
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,039
ARCHER: And even more
unclear on who you are?

111
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,107
RILEY: Name's Rip Riley.

112
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,342
Your mother hired me to
bring you back, Sterling.

113
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,210
ARCHER: She what?!

114
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,944
I mean who?!

115
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,646
I'm Randy! See?

116
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:54,083
So you can just go back to...
that other guy's mother and tell

117
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:56,185
her that even if you did
find that other guy,

118
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,255
he's never coming back to ISIS!

119
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:00,956
Wait, did you say ISIS, or...?

120
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,225
How did ISIS suddenly get in
the mix, is what I'm asking.

121
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,161
RILEY: And I'm asking you, for
the second and last time,

122
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:05,961
to get on that plane.

123
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,329
ARCHER: Ya wanna try and make me?

124
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:08,230
RILEY: No, I don't.

125
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:15,872
And I promise -- you
don't want that either.

126
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,909
ARCHER: Hey, so listen...
I think we got off on the wrong foot?

127
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,013
But I'm willing to, ya know, let
bygones be gone by the wayside...

128
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,282
RILEY: Good to know...
But I'm there yet.

129
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,783
ARCHER: Well, give it some time.

130
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,852
Speaking of, how long
is this stupid flight?

131
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,688
RILEY: Eh, about forty hours in the air...
ARCHER: Hooray...

132
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,657
RILEY: But I have to
island-hop to re-fuel.

133
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:38,594
Old Lucy Goosey here only has a range
of about a thousand nautical miles.

134
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,930
ARCHER: Making it wildly
impractical, got it.

135
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,698
RILEY: This plane is
totally practical!

136
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,466
ARCHER: Maybe for this
ridiculous image you're trying

137
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,435
to cultivate for yourself...
RILEY: What image?

138
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,303
ARCHER: Sky Captain
of Yesteryeeear!

139
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,340
RILEY: At least I'm not sky
captain of I ran away from home,

140
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,008
ARCHER: I didn't run
away from home!

141
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:53,608
I'm a grown man!

142
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:56,278
Whose fiance was murdered
in front of his very eyes!

143
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,880
So excuse me for needing
some time to grieve!

144
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,715
RILEY: By tending bar
and banging newlyweds?

145
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:04,185
ARCHER: Apparently that's
my grieving process!

146
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,519
And also I need to
use the bathroom!

147
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:06,720
RILEY: A, it's called the head.

148
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:07,955
And B, no.

149
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:08,955
Pee in your pants.

150
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,724
ARCHER: Yeah, wrong number.

151
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,859
And I've literally had nothing but
liquor and mangoes for three months,

152
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:17,696
so unless you wanna fly a thousand
nautical miles sitting next to that...

153
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,297
RILEY: Okay, I'm setting
the auto-pilot.

154
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,199
But this better not be a ruse.

155
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:22,167
ARCHER: A ruse?

156
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,301
Brrring! Brrring!

157
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,902
Hello?

158
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,971
Hi, it's the 1930's, can we have our
words and clothes and shitty airplane

159
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,305
back?

160
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:28,039
RILEY: Let's go, kid.

161
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,174
ARCH: Call ya back, 1930's!

162
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:31,209
And hey, watch out for
that Adolf Hitler!

163
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,010
He's a bad egg!

164
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,080
RILEY: No, one pedal fills it with water -- 
ARCHER: I did that!

165
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,815
RILEY: And the other
pedal flushes it!

166
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:38,150
ARCHER: No, it doesn't!

167
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:42,187
Ugh, you come try, I gotta
choke down this gag reflex.

168
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:42,655
Yeah, ha ha!

169
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:45,224
Quit being a dick for five
seconds and unlock the door!

170
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,393
RILEY: It doesn't have a lock!

171
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,328
ARCHER: Dammit, I'm gonna
puke and there's no room

172
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:49,363
in the toilet or the sink!

173
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,499
RILEY: What the hell'd
you put in the sink?!

174
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:53,434
ARCHER: A ruse!

175
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,336
You big dumb idiot.

176
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:58,106
And also a bunch of shaving
cream and toilet paper.

177
00:06:58,175 --> 00:06:59,641
Just because.

178
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,077
LANA: And where does Malory get
off implying we didn't try our

179
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:02,778
best to find Archer?

180
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,346
GILLETTE: No, she
straight up said it.

181
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:07,048
What she implied was that
we're jealous of Archer,

182
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:09,617
and that you hate yourself cause
you're still attracted to him.

183
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:10,918
LANA: I -- that's -- what?!

184
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:12,619
PAM: Oh please, you're
so hot for him I could

185
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,922
re-heat this chili in yer cooch.

186
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,858
LANA: Don't you have some...
humans to resource?!

187
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:19,025
PAM: Actually, no.

188
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:20,927
Most of my job's dealing
with sexual harrassment

189
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:25,431
complaints against Mr. Archer, so...
are we gonna some cooch chili

190
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,368
or what?

191
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:32,372
RILEY: Wuzza... wuzz...
What in the holy hell are you doing?

192
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,974
ARCHER: Well it was gonna
be an Old Fashioned,

193
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,877
but I couldn't find any bitters, so --
RILEY: How long was I out?!

194
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:37,477
ARCHER: Hard to say.

195
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:40,113
After I shaved and stuff I
took a pretty long nap, so --

196
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,314
RILEY: Uncuff me, you idiot!

197
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:44,384
Holy God, if we overshot
our chance to refuel...!

198
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,119
ARCHER: I thought you
put it on auto-pilot!

199
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:48,387
RILEY: It just maintains
course and altitude!

200
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:51,824
It doesn't know how to find the
only airstrip within a thousand

201
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:55,460
miles so it can land
itself when it needs gas!

202
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,396
ARCHER: Well, then I
misunderstood the concept.

203
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:59,397
RILEY: Uncuff me!

204
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:00,231
ARCHER: Okay, God!

205
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,433
Wait, first promise you
won't take me back to ISIS!

206
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,167
RILEY: ISIS?!

207
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:06,036
You'll be lucky if I can
get us back to land!

208
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,138
Now uncuff me!

209
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,373
ARCHER: Okay, God!

210
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:09,007
Wait a minute.

211
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:12,777
Is this a ruse?

212
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,195
ARCHER: Because if it is?

213
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,415
Pretty elaborate.

214
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:19,883
RILEY: Dammit!

215
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:20,931
There goes number two!

216
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,340
ARCHER: But it can land
on water, right?!

217
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:23,696
I mean, isn't that
the whole point?!

218
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:24,986
RILEY: It's a kinda
different story when we're

219
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,688
dropping like a ton of bricks!

220
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,424
Damn, I can barely hold her level!

221
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:30,959
ARCHER: Want me to
help steer, or...?

222
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,727
RILEY: Haven't you
done enough already?!

223
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,996
ARCHER: Wh-?!
How is this suddenly my fault?!

224
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,656
RILEY: Okay, this is it!

225
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,999
C'mon Lucy Goosey, you can do it!

226
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:43,236
Looking good, girl...
I think we're gonna be okay!

227
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,837
ARCHER: Wait, you didn't
put the wheels down!

228
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:47,706
RILEY: The wh -- Noooo!

229
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,835
ARCHER: Woooooo!

230
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:51,038
Two personal records!

231
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:55,844
For breath holding and number of
sharks shot in the frickin face!

232
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,647
Did you see that?

233
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,815
Dude are you even alive?

234
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,817
MALORY: No, that side's too low!

235
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,586
CHERYL/CAROL: Well I
can't tell from here!

236
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,521
MALORY: Well I can,
and it's too low.

237
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,325
CYRIL: I think you mean premature...
MALORY: What'd you say?!

238
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:09,025
CYRIL: Nothing!

239
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,828
LANA: It's just that Archer obviously
doesn't want to come back,

240
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,830
so I don't know how Riley's
gonna get him on a plane...

241
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,265
CHERYL/CAROL: Which, I bet will crash...
CYRIL: Yeahhh!

242
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,100
MALORY: Now you listen!

243
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:20,469
Sterling is coming home safe and
sound, and when he does it'll be no

244
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:24,373
thanks to you people, so you can
forget about getting Carvel!

245
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:27,776
GILLETTE: Aww... Cookie Puss.

246
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:30,812
RILEY: Wuzza... wuzz...
what the... what in the holy

247
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,080
hell are you doing now?!

248
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,516
ARCHER: Ugh, wondering why
this is called a D-Ration.

249
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:35,851
Oughta call it a Y-ration.

250
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,854
As in "Hey, this
tastes like catshit."

251
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:41,191
RILEY: They're not candy bars,
jackass, they're survival rations!

252
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,393
And they might have
to last us a while!

253
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:47,598
ARCHER: Umm...
RILEY: You son of a -- okay, that is it!

254
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,601
As of right now, I'm -- what the...?!

255
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,603
ARCHER: Looking for this?

256
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,537
RILEY: Give me that weapon.

257
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:53,471
ARCHER: No. You're agitated.

258
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,473
RILEY: I'm "agitated" because
you crashed my plane in the God

259
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:59,442
knows if it's even the
middle of the Pacific Ocean!

260
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:01,844
ARCHER: Yeah, which you're floating
on, and not getting shit out of

261
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:02,712
a shark in!

262
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:03,212
RILEY: Wait, what?

263
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:05,447
ARCHER: I saved you from a shark!

264
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:09,017
Let's see, after I pulled you out
of that shitheap of a plane,

265
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,886
but before I gave you CPR
and bandaged your head!

266
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:12,887
RILEY: Oh.

267
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:13,788
Well... thanks.

268
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:14,923
ARCHER: You're welcome.

269
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:15,990
Sorry I ate so much food.

270
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,492
RILEY: Yeah, that was
a pretty dick move...

271
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,827
ARCHER: If it makes you feel any
better I puked most of it up --

272
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,396
RILEY: It doesn't --
ARCHER: raft's pretty bobby.

273
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,431
RILEY: Well we've got a few
gallons of fresh water,

274
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,268
a desalinator for when that runs out...
let's see,

275
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,970
flare gun and some flares,
fishing gear... oh!

276
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,738
And this guy.

277
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:30,338
ARCHER: What is that?

278
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,406
RILEY: Emergency beacon.

279
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:35,177
Beams a signal directly to the ISIS satellite...
BILBO: Oh well that's

280
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:35,911
just great!

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,081
Now I get to deal with this, as
my hot meatball sub congeals

282
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,286
into a big fat disappointing
blob of shit.

283
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,287
SIGINT NERD: Nobody's
gonna touch that?

284
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:46,921
RILEY: Yeah.

285
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,190
So I figure three days for ISIS
to get a rescue team out here.

286
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:49,958
ARCHER: Nice!

287
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,694
So we just kick back, catch a
few rays, catch some sushi...

288
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,363
RILEY: Well it's not gonna
be a picnic, but --

289
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:55,899
ARCHER: Hey, can I
check that thing out?

290
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,367
RILEY: Okay, but don't
mess with the knobs, I've

291
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,738
got the frequency all set, so --
ARCHER: Hey thanks, Guglielmo Marconi.

292
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:03,941
Who I think invented the radio.

293
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,475
Over.

294
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:06,478
MALORY: But if the emergency
beacon is going off --

295
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:09,548
oh my God, their plane crashed!

296
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:13,052
CHERYL/CAROL: (gasps) I said
that would happen and it did!

297
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,320
What if I have
psycho-kinetic powers?!

298
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,957
PAM: I dunno, just try
to only use em for good.

299
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:19,959
CHERYL/CAROL: No.

300
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:20,826
MALORY: Well?!

301
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,462
Don't just sit there sweating
like a gigantic cheese!

302
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,329
Do something!

303
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:25,230
BILBO: Ow, and I am.

304
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,501
Our satellite's locked on
the beacon, which is, jeez,

305
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:29,335
the middle of nowhere.

306
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,135
MALORY: Lana, Ray!

307
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,704
Get there this instant!

308
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,939
LANA: Uh, sorta following
up on his thing about the

309
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:37,076
middle of nowhere... how?

310
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,045
The black titanium
corporate card?!

311
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,981
PAM: I thought it was just a myth!

312
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,684
Like a big, beautiful,
no-limit unicorn!

313
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:46,854
MALORY: Charter a private jet to
Honolulu, then I don't care if you have

314
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,590
to buy a plane, get out
there and find him!

315
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,592
CYRIL: Wait, no, that's
not in the budget!

316
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,227
MALORY: Say budget
to me again, Cyril.

317
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:55,929
CYRIL: Save your receipts, please.

318
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:58,664
MALORY: And call me the very
instant you have an update!

319
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,265
And you!

320
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,502
You lose my son, you'll have to drink
your meatballs subs through a straw.

321
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:04,369
BILBO: Again, ow.

322
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:08,073
And again, the satellite is locked
on the beacon, so unless he,

323
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:11,776
I dunno, throws it away... MALORY: Wh-?
Why the hell would he do that?!

324
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:12,577
ARCHER: I told you!

325
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:14,012
I'm not going back there!

326
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:17,616
RILEY: Well, you say that...
ARCHER: Riley no shit, I will shoot you.

327
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,884
RILEY: And then I'll shoot you.

328
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:19,384
With a flare.

329
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,954
And then I'll use a D-ration bar
and two survival crackers to

330
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:27,027
make s'mores over the crackling fire
that used to be your chest cavity.

331
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:28,028
ARCHER: God damn, dude.

332
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,030
RILEY: Sorry, but you're
acting really crazy.

333
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:30,497
ARCHER: Well?!

334
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:31,399
Being a spy makes you crazy!

335
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,902
I mean what kind of job is that,
where your fiance gets murdered?!

336
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,036
Hello, stress!

337
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,805
Don't even get me started on my mother,
I mean she -- RILEY: She can be

338
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:42,043
a steel-clad bitch, I know,
why do you think I left ISIS?

339
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,378
ARCHER: Wh-?
You were an ISIS agent?!

340
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,380
RILEY: Briefly, way back.

341
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,282
Didn't work out, because,
ya know, your mother...

342
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,817
ARCHER: Was impossible
to please, right?

343
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:50,586
RILEY: God, if you only knew...
ARCHER: What?

344
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,788
RILEY: ...
how much your mom loves you!

345
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,257
You would at least have the
heart to go tell her you're

346
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,124
quitting in person.

347
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:56,658
ARCHER: Eesh.

348
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,627
Rather get shot with a flare...
RILEY: Oh, man up!

349
00:13:58,696 --> 00:13:59,328
Talk to your mother.

350
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:02,832
Then you can go be a bartender, and
destroy a new marriage every week.

351
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:04,133
ARCHER: C'mon, that
marriage was doomed.

352
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:09,072
RILEY: And so are we, if we don't
work together out here, so... truce?

353
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,842
ARCHER: Uh, ya, and hey,
we're not doomed!

354
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,077
Look!

355
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,278
Over here! Hey!

356
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,547
RILEY: No no no wait, get down!

357
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:18,081
ARCHER: Wh-?

358
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,115
Don't you wanna get rescued?

359
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,984
RILEY: Yeah, but those
could be pirates!

360
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,086
ARCHER: Okay, well, they'll
just have to do 'til we

361
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,021
find some cowboys and Indians.

362
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,622
RILEY: What?!

363
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,256
ARCHER: What what.

364
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,626
What're you talking about?

365
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:35,732
ARCHER: I'm sorry... I didn't know pirates
were...still a real thing.

366
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,794
ARCHER: Man, this is not
at all what I pictured...

367
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:42,594
I mean, you hear "pirate ship"

368
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:46,198
you think sails, cannonballs...
oh, and not one of these guys has a beard.

369
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,222
RILEY: You done?
ARCHER: Hang on.

370
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,527
Planks.
Now I'm done.

371
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,004
RILEY: Because the fact that
we're still alive tells me they

372
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,807
wanna try to r --
ARCHER: Don't say rape.

373
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,841
RILEY: Ransom us.

374
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,808
ARCHER: Awesome.

375
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:57,676
Compared to rape.

376
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:59,377
Which seems like a thing
pirates would do.

377
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:01,713
RILEY: But those numbskulls who
picked us up were so drunk --

378
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:03,248
ARCHER: Now that did seem piratey.

379
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,449
RILEY: -- they forgot to search me.

380
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,984
ARCHER: Well, unless you've
got a bunch of Navy SEALs

381
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,385
stuffed in your pants...
RILEY: No!

382
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:08,486
I've got the signal beacon!

383
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:08,886
ARCHER: So?

384
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,654
RILEY: So we just stall the
pirates until the ISIS rescue

385
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,057
team shows up, boards the
ship, and takes 'em all out!

386
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,358
Bing, Bang, Boom.

387
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,260
[ laughter ]

388
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:18,828
RILEY: Which is funny why?

389
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,730
ARCHER: Well, gee,
where do I start?

390
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,000
GILLETTE: I will start with the
caviar and the '38 Montrachet,

391
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:27,603
then do the Kobe tartare
with this '42 Lapin,

392
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,606
and then this chocolate
terrine looks insaaane.

393
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,875
And then I guess just send me
to fat camp and pray to God

394
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:36,212
I don't eat all those fat,
delicious little chiddrens.

395
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,847
Because I will gobble them up.

396
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:40,516
RILEY: Wow, ISIS has
really gone downhill.

397
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,950
But there must be
some good agents.

398
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,852
ARCHER: It kills me to say
it, but it maybe Lana...

399
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:47,288
LANA: Ray, I doubt that's what
Malory had in mind when she gave

400
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:48,088
us the card.

401
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,723
Ya know, we are on
a rescue mission.

402
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:50,223
GILLETTE: Ugh.

403
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,860
Rescue me from myself...
such a fatty.

404
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,696
ARCHER: But even so, I wouldn't put
all my rescue eggs in that basket.

405
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:57,130
RILEY: Well?!

406
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,431
You got a better plan?!

407
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,866
ARCHER: I don't, I'm
not really a planner.

408
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:03,738
My process is a little more...
organic?

409
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:04,506
PIRATE: Datang!

410
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:05,640
Untuk kapten!

411
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,077
ARCHER: So let's just play it by ear,
see where the afternoon takes us.

412
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:09,578
See?

413
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:11,881
This is why I like
to keep it loose.

414
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,783
I mean the wine's crap,
but -- Oh, sorry.

415
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:14,484
No offense, captain.

416
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,787
CAPTAIN: No, I am who am sorry.

417
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,922
This from million dollar yacht.

418
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,825
Now I don't feel bad
for killing them.

419
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,528
ARCHER: Serves em right, those jerks...
CAPTAIN: But you know wine!

420
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:25,429
You rich man!

421
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:27,898
ARCHER: Who me? No, I'm -- 
CAPTAIN: Rich man!

422
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,866
My men take this off you!

423
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,302
The Omicron Spacemaster!

424
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,972
ARCHER: Oh, it's actually
the Sp -- acemaster, yeah.

425
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,177
Good ol' Spacemaster...
CAPTAIN: To Sterleen... Love, Muddah.

426
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,912
You muddah rich lady!

427
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:41,813
ARCHER: Uh... oh!

428
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:45,651
Yeah, crazy-rich, she invented
the splashless urinal cake.

429
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,218
CAPTAIN: The what?

430
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,888
ARCHER: They're -- doesn't matter,
she's rich and she loves me

431
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:53,526
and I'm really rich and this is
my manservant, uh... Jerkins.

432
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,427
RILEY: Funny stuff.

433
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,428
ARCHER: Not now, Jerkins.

434
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,797
So I bet she'd pay whatever
ransom you ask for.

435
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,400
Splashless urinal cakes have
been pretty good to us.

436
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,034
As you can imagine.

437
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,869
CAPTAIN: This good to hear...
ARCHER: But we can't do any

438
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,304
of that "mail somebody a finger"

439
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:09,174
- shit, or -- 
- No, no, no we take you back to my island!

440
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:12,610
Call you muddah, get
a big big money!

441
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,144
ARCHER: Awesome.

442
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:14,079
Compared to finger-mailing.

443
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:17,149
So tell me about this
island of yours?

444
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,018
BILBO: It's a tiny little
rock called Pangu...

445
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,787
Nothin else within a thousand
miles, and the beacon's been

446
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,123
headin straight for it
at about twenty knots.

447
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,292
MALORY: So a ship must
have picked them up!

448
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,960
But I've never even
heard of Pangu.

449
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,096
Is there a naval base there, or...?

450
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,798
BILBO: Mmmnot exactly.

451
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,734
It's more of a, uh...
LANA: Pirate fortress.

452
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,303
No, yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you said

453
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:38,071
the phrase "pirate fortress."

454
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,208
Which apparently, yes, you
did, say the word pirate,

455
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,744
followed by the word --
CAPTAIN: Fortress!

456
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,515
That is the word, My english so crap...
ARCHER: Eh, I bet you just need

457
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:48,182
more practice.

458
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,752
Try this: Jerkins,
you're a douchebag!

459
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,386
RILEY: Funny stuff.

460
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,188
CAPTAIN: Jehkin, you dooshaback!

461
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,222
ARCHER: Keep at it.

462
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,557
Oh and hey, did we cross the
international date line?

463
00:17:56,626 --> 00:18:00,695
Because I can change the date for
you on that Omicron Spacemaster.

464
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,329
CAPTAIN: Eh?

465
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:05,899
Yeah, okay dumb guy... ARCHER: Wouldn't
want to be walking around like a

466
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:06,766
dickhead!

467
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:11,003
With the wrong date on your...
Omicron Spymaster!

468
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:11,671
CAPTAIN: Wh-?!

469
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:12,738
Wuzza hell dumb guy?

470
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,007
ARCHER: It's the
Omicron Spymaster!

471
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,977
Which is why it's got knockout
gas and a garrote and I think

472
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:21,180
even a laser and Riley do I have
to kill everybody myself?!

473
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:25,250
RILEY: Huh? Oh!

474
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,019
ARCHER: Seriously, what
the hell, Riley?!

475
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,720
RILEY: I didn't know you
were making a move!

476
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:29,788
ARCHER: Uh, dickhead?!

477
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,022
RILEY: Takes one to know one.

478
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:33,024
ARCHER: No!
Dickhead was the go-word!

479
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:34,392
RILEY: How was I
supposed to know?!

480
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,662
ARCHER: Oh. Yeah sorry, I forgot
to tell you the go-word was --

481
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,967
CAPTAIN: Dooshaback!

482
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,070
ARCHER: But even still,
Riley you gotta be quicker.

483
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:46,639
I mean, I know you're pretty old but --
RILEY: Well now that I know the

484
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,909
go-word, I -- 
ARCHER: No, idiot, it changes every time.

485
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:49,877
RILEY: Well what is it now?

486
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:50,444
ARCHER: Pirates!

487
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:56,050
RILEY: Kinda confusing, since we're on a --
Owww! Come on, that was right

488
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,085
next to my frickin ear!

489
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,487
ARCHER: Sorry, I know that hurts.

490
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,889
Happens to me kind of a lot.

491
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,025
I actually have like
mild tinnitis now.

492
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:09,330
I mean, it's gotten to where I had
to start sleeping with a fan on.

493
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,767
RILEY: Oh my God... ARCHER: Yeah,
otherwise it's like eeeeeeeeeee.

494
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,036
RILEY: No, you just
killed like, ten pirates.

495
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,038
ARCHER: Wow, and if the
five-year old me knew that

496
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,440
he would get a huge boner.

497
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:20,575
No idea why I said that.

498
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,777
RILEY: Well once these idiots
figure out they can turn those

499
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:28,183
twenty-millimeter cannons on the
wheelhouse, we'll be -- kinda confused.

500
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,084
ARCHER: What are they doing?

501
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:30,852
RILEY: It looks like
they're surrendering!

502
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:31,286
ARCHER: Why?

503
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,154
All they have to do is --
RILEY: Shut up, who cares why?

504
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:33,855
ARCHER: I do!

505
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:34,656
What if it's a ruse?

506
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,557
RILEY: It's not a ruse!

507
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:37,259
Say something, before
they change their minds!

508
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,094
ARCHER: Do they speak English?

509
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:40,896
Uh... hello, pirates!

510
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:44,066
Who speaks English,
let's see some hands!

511
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,102
ARCHER: Wow, way
more than I thought.

512
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,103
NOAH: Uh, excuse me?

513
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,072
Sorry, hi, I'm Noah?

514
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:50,607
ARCHER: What're you,
the first mate, or...?

515
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:54,478
NOAH: Oh!
Oh God no, no, I'm a bajak budak?

516
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:58,849
It's sort of a -- well, I guess the
nearest translation is slave-pirate?

517
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,117
ARCHER: Do you speak English?

518
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:01,018
NOAH: I do.

519
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:03,687
They don't, though, they're just
surrendering the ship to you.

520
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:04,688
Dan benteng?

521
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:05,122
PIRATE: Ya.

522
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:05,890
NOAH: And the fort.

523
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:06,824
You're the new captain.

524
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:07,425
ARCHER: The what?!

525
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:10,294
NOAH: Well if you kill the old
captain, you become the new captain.

526
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:12,996
I know you don't think of
pirates as having a lot of

527
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,131
rules, but they actually
do and that's a big one.

528
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,333
ARCHER: Well, tell them...
hands down!

529
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,536
NOAH: Tangan ke bawah!

530
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:20,370
ARCHER: Holy shit!

531
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:21,304
Did you see that?!

532
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:24,106
RILEY: No, I'm too busy looking at that...
ARCHER: What is...

533
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,040
what am I seeing?

534
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,143
NOAH: Oh, the women always us throw a
huge feast when we return to port.

535
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:30,112
Should I tell them
to cancel it, or...?

536
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,146
ARCHER: Huh?

537
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:34,415
No, we're totally feasting!

538
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,016
Say that!

539
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,319
NOAH: Mulai pesta!

540
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:38,152
RILEY: Nice plan.

541
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:41,556
Once they're good and drunk we'll
turn this tub around and head home.

542
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,159
ARCHER: Home?
Riley... I am home.

543
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:47,061
RILEY: Wh-? ! Over my dead body are you
running away to be a pirate!

544
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,010
ARCHER: Of course I'm not
gonna be a pirate...

545
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,840
I'm gonna be a pirate king.

546
00:20:55,166 --> 00:21:05,669
