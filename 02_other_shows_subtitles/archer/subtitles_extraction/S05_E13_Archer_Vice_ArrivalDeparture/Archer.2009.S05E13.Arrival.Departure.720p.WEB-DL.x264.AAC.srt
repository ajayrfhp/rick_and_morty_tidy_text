1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:03,093
>> ARCHER: What do you mean,
your water broke?!

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,962
>> LANA: What do you mean, what
do I mean? I mean that!

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:05,996
I'm going into labor!

4
00:00:05,998 --> 00:00:06,997
>> CHERLENE: Wait. What?!

5
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,998
>> LANA: I'm having a baby?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,999
>> CHERLENE: Gross!

7
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,067
>> ARCHER: Bu-But it's early.

8
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:11,068
Is-is that early?!

9
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,069
>> LANA: Like, ten days, but...

10
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:13,070
>> ARCHER: But that's bad.

11
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:14,071
Is that bad?!

12
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,106
>> LANA: Archer, none of this
is ideal!

13
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:17,107
>> HOLLY: Hey!

14
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:19,743
>> HOLLY: What the hell are you
people doing in San Marcos in

15
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,078
the first place?!

16
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,679
>> LANA: Selling weapons to
Calderón!

17
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,947
>> ARCHER: That we got from him!

18
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:24,915
>> HOLLY: What?!

19
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:27,651
>> HOLLY: <i>What</i> what? You didn't
think that was something I'd

20
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,618
like to know about?!

21
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,454
>> SLATER: I'm positive we
talked about this.

22
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:31,355
>> HOLLY: No, we didn't!

23
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:34,191
>> HOLLY: When?! When did we
talk about this?!

24
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:35,192
>> SLATER: 80% positive.

25
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:38,528
If the CIA is backing the rebels
against Calder...

26
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,696
Ohhh!

27
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:41,031
>> ARCHER: Lana!

28
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,032
Was that a contraction?!

29
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:43,200
>> LANA: Yup. Ohh!

30
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:44,368
God, I hope so. Yup.

31
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,535
>> ARCHER: Time!

32
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:46,703
Start a clock, assholes!

33
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:48,038
>> SLATER: Uh, okay. Mark!

34
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,374
(beep)
>> CHERLENE: Twain!

35
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,541
No, that's barges.

36
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:52,709
>> LANA: Shut up!

37
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,711
(groans)
But, hey, speaking of time...

38
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,047
>> ARCHER: What's your Bishop
Score?!

39
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,048
>> LANA: How should I...? Wait.

40
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,050
How do you even know what a
Bishop Score is?

41
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,052
>> ARCHER: I got certified as a
doula, which, turns out, is not

42
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:03,186
that hard.

43
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,356
Does the CIA know Calderón has a
nerve gas missile at the palace?

44
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,524
>> ARCHER: What?!

45
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,692
>> CHERLENE: Cool.

46
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,028
>> HOLLY: We didn't give him
gas!

47
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,030
>> LANA: Well, he's got it,
and we can't override the launch

48
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,197
sequence, so we've...

49
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,033
>> HOLLY: Get that idiot
Calderón on the phone!

50
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,035
>> ARCHER: Oh, did I mention, a
tiger ate him?

51
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:18,969
>> HOLLY: What?!

52
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,704
>> CHERLENE: Well, not <i>ate</i> ate.

53
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,539
>> ARCHER: Well, no, but by
now...

54
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,909
Okay, Slater, I know it's a
little sooner than we wanted,

55
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,910
but...

56
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:27,677
>> SLATER: Operation Dropkick.

57
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,046
Roger that.

58
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,048
>> LANA: What's Operation
Dropkick?

59
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,916
>> HOLLY: Well, the endgame has
always been for us to invade

60
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,585
>> SLATER: Hey, Donna, we got a
carrier group in the Gulf,

61
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:36,920
right?

62
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,655
>> LANA: Wait. If you were going
to invade San Marcos, then why

63
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:40,991
have you been selling weapons to
Calderón?

64
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:43,026
>> HOLLY: So he could fight the
rebels.

65
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:45,529
>> HOLLY: Well, technically,
they're mercenaries from

66
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,530
Honduras and Guatemala, but yes.

67
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,665
>> LANA: Okay, so, am I just
stupid, or...?

68
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,033
>> CHERLENE: Duh. Pregnant.

69
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,202
>> SLATER: Yeah, airstrike,
naval bombardment, amphibious

70
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:55,672
>> HOLLY: Calderón needed
weapons to fight the rebels, but

71
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,041
he didn't have money to buy
weapons.

72
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,377
He only had cocaine, but Iran
was like, "No way. Cash only."

73
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,545
So...

74
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:02,546
>> ARCHER & LANA: Iran?!

75
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:03,680
>> HOLLY: Ooh, sorry. Iraq.

76
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,048
Wait. No, Iran.

77
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,216
No, doesn't matter who.

78
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:08,552
Anyway, to buy the weapons, we
needed to... monetize the

79
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,686
cocaine.

80
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,222
(Lana gasps)
>> LANA: Oh, my God.

81
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:15,392
We've been trying to monetize
cocaine for, like...

82
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:17,694
I mean, you even came to the
house, where we...

83
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:21,398
We've been selling cocaine for
the CIA so they could buy arms

84
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,566
from Iran?!

85
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,635
Did we at least free some
hostages?!

86
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:28,205
>> HOLLY: No, this was about our
annual budget.

87
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,372
>> ARCHER & LANA: What?!

88
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,374
>> HOLLY: If we don't spend it
this year, we can't get an

89
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,375
increase next year.

90
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:33,543
>> ARCHER: You son of a...

91
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:34,544
>> HOLLY: Oh, come on, Archer.

92
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:35,645
Drop the act!

93
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,047
He was in on it from day one.

94
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,215
>> ARCHER & LANA: What?!

95
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,550
(Lana growls)
(Archer chokes)

96
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:44,454
(Cherlene squeals and laughs)
(Archer chokes)

97
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,530
>> LANA: You lying son of a
bitch!

98
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:29,032
(Archer gasps, mutters)
>> LANA: You knew about this the

99
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,200
entire time?!

100
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,368
>> ARCHER: No, no.

101
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,703
(Archer choking)
(Cherlene squeals)

102
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:34,938
>> SLATER: Hey, do you mind?

103
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,274
I'm trying to call in an
air strike here.

104
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,376
>> HOLLY: Ooh, hey, what's our
ride situation?

105
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:40,544
>> SLATER: Hang on.

106
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:41,711
Thanks, doll.

107
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:44,047
Air strike on the palace is a
go, and I suggest we take

108
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,184
>> HOLLY: Good. Yeah, we need
plenty of room... until we dump

109
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,185
them at a black site.

110
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,121
(Archer gasps, coughs)
>> HOLLY: Come on, even if you

111
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,290
people hadn't lost 50 million
bucks worth of our cocaine, you

112
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,457
know way too much.

113
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,960
>> CHERLENE: Uh, I don't know
anything!

114
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,129
>> HOLLY: I believe that to be
literally true.

115
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:00,297
 <i>Oye, muchachos!</i>

116
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,999
 <i>Agarrenlos!</i>

117
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,903
(Lana grunts)
(grunting)

118
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,905
(gun cocks, Lana yells)
>> HOLLY: Okay. Whoa! Whoa!

119
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:09,906
>> SLATER: Jesus! We give up.

120
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:10,907
>> HOLLY: Whoa! Whoa! Come on.

121
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,075
>> SLATER: Don't shoot!

122
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:14,411
(Lana sighs)
>> LANA: Now then.

123
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:15,579
Let's get this baby out of me.

124
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,913
>> CHERLENE: Gross!

125
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,081
>> LANA: Will you sh...

126
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,717
(Lana groans loudly)
>> ARCHER (weakly): Time?!

127
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,052
>> SLATER: Nine minutes!

128
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,220
What? This is exciting.

129
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,354
>> KRIEGER: Right?

130
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:26,690
>> FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Minutes to launch-- 60.

131
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,192
>> RAY: Yeah, Krieger, I guess
trying to defuse a warhead

132
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,529
tipped with deadly nerve gas <i>is</i>
<i>technically exciting.</i>

133
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,697
>> KRIEGER: Yeah, right?

134
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,031
>> RAY: What is wrong with you?

135
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,199
>> KRIEGER: Nothin', Roy.

136
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,367
>> RAY: Or Ray.

137
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,703
>> KRIEGER: Eh. Doesn't matter
who.

138
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,037
>> CYRIL: Krieger!

139
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,206
(Krieger and Ray gasp)
>> CYRIL: Where are we on the

140
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,274
missile?!

141
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,509
>> KRIEGER: Uh, kind of just
like... on it.

142
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,912
Oh, do you mean where are we in
the process of disarming it?

143
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,080
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

144
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,415
(Cyril sighs)
Ow! Come on. Ow! Ow!

145
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,583
>> CYRIL: Okay.

146
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,584
>> MALORY: What happened?!

147
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,919
Did it explode?!

148
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,087
>> CYRIL: Uh, no.

149
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,056
>> MALORY: Well, it's just a
matter of time before it does,

150
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,224
with those idiots working on it!

151
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,392
We need to leave!

152
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:04,694
>> CYRIL: Well, A: I'm
president for life, so I'm not

153
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,029
going anywhere, and B...

154
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,464
>> COMANDANTE: Señor Presidente!

155
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:10,033
Our radar station has detected
incoming bombers!

156
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,369
From their heading, they
appear... American!

157
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,638
(Malory gasps)

>> COMANDANTE: And I hate to
tell you this, but the First

160
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,542
Lady and I are having an affair.

161
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:22,045
(Cyril sniffles)
>> CYRIL: Damn, dawg.

162
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,213
That was my B.

163
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:25,615
>> JULIANA: It's over, Cyril.

164
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,950
It's over!

00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,118
>> CYRIL: Nothing is over!

166
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,286
Nothing!

167
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,453
You don't just turn it off!

168
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,621
It wasn't my war!

169
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,956
You asked me.

170
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,124
I didn't ask you!

171
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,459
And I did what I had to do to
win!

172
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,962
But somebody wouldn't let us
win!

173
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,298
>> MALORY: Yes, and that
somebody is a U.S. Navy carrier

174
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,465
group, so let's go already!

175
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,968
(Cyril sniffles)
>> CYRIL: Okay, but I'm taking

176
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,136
these.

177
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,438
>> MALORY (laughing): Oh, we're
taking everything!

178
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,940
Furs, jewels, the silverware,
bullion, anything you can cram

179
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,108
in a suitcase!

180
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,444
>> PAM: Mm, mm. Wouldn't bullion
leak out of a...?

181
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,612
Ow! Ow!

182
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:57,981
Cut it... Ow, goddamn it!

183
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,149
I... Ow!

184
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,484
>> MALORY: Gold bullion, you
idiot!

185
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,020
>> PAM: I don't know what that
is!

186
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,022
>> JULIANA: And I don't know who
you think you are!

187
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:09,492
>> MALORY: Oh, yes, we are, and
if you've got any sense, you'll

188
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,661
fill your pockets, too!

189
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,298
Because your regime is
officially over.

190
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,501
And I've seen coups from Angola
to Zanzibar, and this is how it

191
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,037
ends: in the trunk of a taxi
to the airport, your belly

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,207
full of diamonds and vodka,
praying your driver doesn't

193
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:27,644
rat you out to the Reds
at the last checkpoint.

194
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:30,347
Because then, the last thing
you'll ever hear, besides a

195
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,049
pistol cocking behind your head,
is Ivan's laugh--

196

(Pam cackling)
>> MALORY: What... in the name

197
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:40,123
of God... is funny?!

198
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,459
>> PAM (laughing): You said
you've seen cooze.

199
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:46,162
(Pam clears her throat)
Appropes.

>> CHERLENE: Aww...

207
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,142
All the gardeners are running
away.

208
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:01,478
>> HOLLY: Because this entire
country's about to be up to its

209

>> SLATER: And unless you people
want to wind up classified as

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,516
enemy combatants, you...

211
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:10,387
(gunfire)
>> ARCHER: Six minutes!

212
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,189
Got to remember to breathe,
though. That's the...

213
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,025
>> LANA: Oh, get out, you lying
sack of bastard!

214
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,528
>> ARCHER: Okay, A: He and
Mother are the lying sacks of

215
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,529
bastard.

216
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,898
I didn't know it was the CIA's
cocaine.

217
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,402
And B: Seriously, buddy, let's
try and work on that breathing.

218
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,404
>> CHERLENE: What's wrong with
her?

219
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,671
>> ARCHER: Wha...?

220
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:31,207
She's having a baby!

221
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,543
>> CHERLENE: Gross.

222

(Cherlene slurping)
(Lana breathing rapidly)

223
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,585
>> ARCHER: Doing good, buddy.

224
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,053
>> LANA: Archer!

225
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:47,257
If you call me buddy again, I
will put the bullets in your

226
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,558
body by hand!

227
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,194
>> ARCHER: Shh, and we're
breathing...

228
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:54,397
(both breathe deeply)
>> LANA (exhaling): Ooh...

229
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,465
>> ARCHER: There we go.

230
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,466
Okay, Carol!

231
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:59,035
(Cherlene slurps)
>> CHERLENE: What?

232
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:01,204
Jesus! What is your problem!

233
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:04,107
>> LANA: Morphine, want, find,
give!

234
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,443
>> ARCHER: Shh. Come on, Lana,
you don't need that.

235
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,445
>> LANA (gasps): How dare you
tell me what I...

236
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,581
Okay, Carol, I need you to look
down there and give me a

237
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,582
sit-rep.

238
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:13,583
>> CHERLENE: Down where?

239
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,585
>> ARCHER: There, down there, at
her, um...

240
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,220
>> CHERLENE: Ew! No! You do it!

241
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,221
>> SLATER: I'll do it!

242
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:21,925
I can't look down there because
there's, like, a hundred percent

243
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:23,927
chance that at some point in the
future we're gonna have sex,

244
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:24,928
so...

245
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,897
>> ARCHER: Shh. So just look
down there and...

246
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,134
>> CHERLENE: I'm not looking at
her goddamn va... Joinks!

247
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,503
Well, you don't need to shave.

248
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:36,272
(laughs) That thing is smooth.

249
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,407
>> LANA: I...!

250
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,408
Thank you.

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,410
>> CHERLENE: And also kind of
mauve.

252
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:41,644
>> LANA (sighs): Okay.

253
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,481
>> SLATER: Eh, I'd say more of a
mauve-taupe?

254
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,482
Ow!

255

(Lana grunting loudly)

256
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,286
breathe, friend.

00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:51,588
Because, uh...

258
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,922

I have some thoughts on this.

>> KRIEGER: Oh. Okay.

270
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,178
So, I don't think we can disarm
this thing.

>> KRIEGER: Yes.

273
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:21,317
Oh. Okay. So, it doesn't have an
explosive payload, so it's

274
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,319
basically just a flying
trash can.

275
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,522

00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:47,470
get the jet ready for takeoff...

313
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,205
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country!

314
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,206
>> ARCHER: Let me finish!

315
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,543
>> ARCHER: <i>And</i> make sure they
don't escape.

316
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:56,379
>> CHERLENE: Oh, my God, good
thing you added that last part.

317
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,148
You heard the doula-- move it!

318
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,417
>> LANA: And get me some
frickin' morphine!

319
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,920
>> ARCHER: Lana, come on, what
kind of doula would I be if I

320
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:04,988
let you have more...

321
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,923
(rifle clicks)
>> ARCHER: Wha...?

322
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,925
(Lana grunting loudly)
>> ARCHER: Wow.

323
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,495
>> ARCHER (chuckling): You were
really gonna shoot me in the

324
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,496
face?

325
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:17,133
>> LANA (sniffles): Is that so
much to ask?

326
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,167
>> COPILOT: Uncle.

327
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,503
Uh, friend of the family.

328
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:23,072
>> PILOT: Dude. Drop it.

329
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:29,178
(classical piano music playing)
>> COMANDANTE: We should get to

330
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,680
the shelter soon.

331
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,682
>> JULIANA: You coward.

332
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,950
>> COMANDANTE: Wha...?

333
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:37,286
>> JULIANA: I've never loved
you.

334
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,923
(Comandante sighs)
>> COMANDANTE: Okay.

335
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,026
>> CYRIL: But what if the rebels
recognize me?

336
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:46,295
>> PAM: Yeah, and then drag him
out of the car and kneel him

337
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,631
down and shoot him in the back
of the head and string him up on

338
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,533
a lamppost like Mussolini!

339
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,869
>> CYRIL: Yeah. What then?

340
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,338
>> MALORY: That's a chance I'm
willing to take.

341
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,006
>> PAM: Me too.

342
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,175
(Pam munching, chewing)
>> MALORY: Cyril, look...

343
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,179
(Cyril screaming)
(Krieger and Gillette screaming)

344
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,450
(all screaming)
(screaming stops)

345
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:11,220
(song playing quietly on radio)
>> KRIEGER: Hi, guys.

346
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,189
>> MALORY: What the hell are you
idiots...

347
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,591
(rumbling)
(song continues on radio):

348
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,501
¶ It's them broken hearts...
>> KRIEGER: Oh, come on, we

349
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,669
couldn't leave it in the rocket.

350
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:29,205
(car thuds, all gasp)
And we couldn't just leave it

351
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,040
lying in the road.

352
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,509
Come on, you don't want a thing
like that falling into the wrong

353
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:37,313
The only thing necessary for
evil to triumph is that good men

354
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,581
do nothing.

355
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,517
>> MALORY: Said the clone of
Adolf Hitler.

356
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,587
>> KRIEGER: Well... Edmund
Burke, but...

357
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,055
Doesn't matter who.

358
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:50,126
(over radio): ¶ ...auto parts
This year. ¶

359
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,599
(rattling)
>> PILOT: Dude, drop it.

360
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,069
>> COPILOT: I'm not gonna judge
you.

361
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,070
>> PILOT: The ordnance, Mike.

362
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,105
Drop the ordnance.

363
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:03,906
>> COPILOT (chuckles): Oh.

364
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,842
Duh.

365
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:07,710
>> PILOT (sighs): Idiot.

366
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:11,047
(explosions thundering)
>> MALORY: Cyril, for God's

367
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,448
sake, be careful!

368
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,449
>> CYRIL: Would you shut up?

369
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,386
(all gasping, grunting)
>> MALORY: Idiot.

370
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,388
(Lana screaming)
>> OTHERS: Huh? What the...?

371
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,556
>> MALORY: Lana?

372
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,558
(Lana screaming)
>> LANA: Archer!

373
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,527
What... are you doing?

374
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,029
>> ARCHER: I'm trying to get
this stupid angle right, Lana,

375
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,065
so you can look in the mirror
and see if you're crowning.

376
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,066
>> LANA: What?!

377
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,068
>> MALORY: For the love of
Christ!

378
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,570
>> ARCHER: Mother, hey, go over
there and tell me if you can...

379
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,938
>> MALORY: Get out!

380
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,774
And, Pam, get <i>in</i> here.

381
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,775
>> LANA (panting): No, no...

382
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,776
>> MALORY: Shh...

383
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,144
Everything's all right.

384
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,446
Here.

385
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,047
All right, now, Pam, I want
you to...

386
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,150
>> PAM: You know how many times
I've helped a cow give birth

387
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,551
in the barn?

388
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,653
Plus, one time, my sister Edie?

389
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,790
Well, she couldn't have it in
the house.

390
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,658
Long story.

391
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,793
A long, racist story.

392
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,794
>> RAY: I had black guy.

393
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,797
>> CYRIL: (groans) I wasn't in
the sperm donor pool.

394
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,799
>> RAY: Phra... Wait, are we
still doing phrasing?

395
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,800
>> KRIEGER: Huh.

396
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,801
Should I be in there?

397
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:05,802
I feel like I should.

398
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,803
I mean, I am a doctor.

399
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,805
>> RAY & CYRIL: No, you're not.

400
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,806
>> KRIEGER: Well, no, but...

401
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,807
a student of life.

402
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,742
(Archer grunting, loud crashing)
>> RAY: Loud.

403
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,844
(more crashing)
I have cigarettes, if you want

404
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:16,479
them!

405
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,782
>> ARCHER: (grunts) No, Ray, I
just feel like smashing stuff.

406
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:22,485
Jesus, I feel so helpless out
here!

407
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,486
What if something goes wrong?

408
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,488
What-what if there's a-a birth
defect or...

409
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,490
>> LANA: (grunts) No. No, no,
stop.

410
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,492
No, what if there's aren't
enough hands and feet?

411
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,993
>> MALORY: Shh, it's going to...

412
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,995
>> LANA: Oh, my God, what if
there are too many hands and

413
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,996
feet?

414
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,433
>> PAM: Hey! I have the correct
number of hands, but they're

415
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,669
currently kind of full and you
need a slappin', so...

416
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,772
>> LANA: Wait... (gasps)
>> MALORY: Oh, please.

417
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,107
Like you're the only one who
ever had a baby in a war zone.

418
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:46,108
>> LANA: You know...

419
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,510
>> PAM: Okay, okay, okay.

420
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,947
Get some hay ready to dry this
little bastard off because now

421
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:52,448
you are gonna push!

422
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,018
>> LANA: (grunts) No, no, no,
no, what if we... Ow!

423
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,386
>> PAM: You old bitch!

424
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:01,624
Now move that big fat smelly
ass, you hear?

425
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,626
 <i>A Day No Pigs Would Die?</i>

426
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:04,861
Anybody?

427
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,396
Not a big Robert Newton Peck
crowd, huh?

428
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:08,531
>> MALORY: Who is...

429
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,899
>> PAM: Oh, shut up. Now push!

430
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,401
(Lana screaming)
>> ARCHER: (gasps) Lana!

431
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,471
>> CYRIL: Hey, hey, come on,
they've got this.

432
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:18,074
(baby crying)
(all gasp)

433
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:21,010
(Archer laughs)
(Cyril grunts)

434
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,011

guy, pay up.

438
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,016

439
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,017
>> PAM: Yep.

440
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,685
Got ourselves a little quadroon.

441
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,022
>> MALORY: (sighs) You did good,
kiddo.

442
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,591
>> LANA (dreamily): Mmm, yeah.

443
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,661
Oh, and, uh, I quit.

444
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,029
>> MALORY: Wha... Why?

445
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,165
>> LANA: Because you lying to me
I can handle-- I'm used to

446
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,767
that-- but...

447
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,936
(sighs) not Archer.

448
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,872
>> MALORY: Oh, for... He didn't
know that I made a deal to sell

449
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:51,774
cocaine for the CIA.

450
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:56,879
>> MALORY: Lana Kane, you have
known me for a long, long time.

451
00:15:56,881 --> 00:16:01,017
When have I ever been honest
with Sterling?

452
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,551
>> LANA: Huh.

453
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,053
>> MALORY: Exactly.

454
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:08,024
Now, if you two will excuse me,
I need to go threaten and/or

455
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,093
bribe some federal agents.

456
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,529
Well, at least put a seatbelt on
it!

457
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,597
>> ARCHER: See?

458
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,600
>> KRIEGER: I thought it was
just for takeoff and landing!

459
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,734
>> MALORY: Jesus Christ.

460
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,037
>> ARCHER: So, um, how's she
doing?

461
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,974
I told her you didn't know
anything about the CIA deal.

462
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,076
>> ARCHER: Well, thanks for
telling the truth, Mother-- sure

463
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:30,780
>> MALORY: You keep it up,
mister, and I'll walk right back

464
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,549
in there and tell her the whole
thing was your idea.

465
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,484
>> ARCHER: Did you guys hear
that?

466
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,619
>> OTHERS: No.

467
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,822
>> MALORY: All right, Holly,
this is my offer and it is

468
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,424
nonnegotiable...

469
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,426
>> PAM: (gasps) You think she's
buying more coke?

470
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:46,462
>> CHERLENE: (groans) You and
your stupid, stupid cocaine!

471
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,797
Can't you give her a brain chip?

472
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,831
>> KRIEGER: A what?

473
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:53,002
Like you gave Cherlene so she
could become a country singer.

474
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,571
>> KRIEGER: Oh, no, that wasn't
a brain chip.

475
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,573
It was just the sticker off the
backpack of a little Lego

476
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,574
spaceman.

477
00:16:58,576 --> 00:16:59,575
>> PAM: What?

478
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:00,576
>> CYRIL: A Lego sticker?

479
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:05,815
So my whole life, all I ever had
to do was believe in myself?

480
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,684
And inject a sticker into my
brain?

481
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:11,454
>> HOLLY: Are you out of your
mind?

482
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:14,457
Showing up at the mansion,
pretending to search for the

483
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,994
>> HOLLY: While planting the
seed in your idiot son's brain

484
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,497
>> MALORY: Which I could have
handled if the CIA had kept its

485
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,432
fat nose out!

486
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:25,668
>> HOLLY: And yet here we are,
with a $50 million hole in our

487
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,669
account.

488
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,837
>> MALORY: There's 40 of it.

489
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,673
An original Ivan Blitko we stole
from Calderón.

490
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,675
>> HOLLY: What am I supposed to
do with that?

491
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,512
What am I supposed to do with a
canister of nerve gas?

492
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,713
>> HOLLY: No, uh-uh.

493
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,515
That is now CIA property.

494
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,119
>> MALORY: Ooh, and won't that
be a feather in your cap.

495
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:45,488
They might even make you
director.

496
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,124
>> HOLLY: Hmm... or at least
Deputy Ops.

497
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:50,659
>> MALORY: Which-- and I'm just
spitballing here-- would mean

498
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:54,997
you could outsource a good deal
of business to a private firm.

499
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,700
(Malory slurps)
Like ISIS.

500
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,803
>> HOLLY: So you lose us $50
million <i>and</i> you want to get on

501
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,505
the CIA payroll?

502
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,740
>> MALORY: Right after you
renovate my offices.

503
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:06,842
>> HOLLY: Ha! You really are out
of your mind.

504
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:09,478
>> MALORY: Or right after I take
this deal to your partner in the

505
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,913
cockpit...

506
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,083
>> RAY: So, what's your deal?

507
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:17,186
>> SLATER: What's my deal?

508
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:20,056
>> RAY: Never mind.

509
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,924
>> MALORY: Because you suddenly
decided to take up skydiving.

510
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,125
(cocks gun)
>> HOLLY: I think we may have a

511
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,429
deal here.

512
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,431
(knocking)
>> ARCHER: Knock, knock.

513
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:29,532
>> LANA: Who's there?

514
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,867
>> ARCHER: Shit, I-I had
something for this.

515
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,437
>> LANA: (sighs) Come see the
baby, stupid.

516
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,704
>> ARCHER: Wow.

517
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:38,674
>> LANA: Yeah.

518
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:39,875
>> ARCHER: Wow.

519
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,510
>> LANA: (sighs) Yeah.

520
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,045
>> ARCHER: I-I had black guy.

521
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:46,048
>> LANA: Yeah. So, about that...

522
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,050
>> ARCHER: I don't think it's
racist, it's just that I

523
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:49,051
thought...

524
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,052
>> LANA: Archer, shut up.

525
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,387
>> ARCHER: (chuckles)
You shut up.

526
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:55,524
(clears throat) Okay, so,
remember when you had cancer?

527
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:58,094
>> ARCHER: (chuckles) Um, uh,
vaguely.

528
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,695
>> LANA: (sighs) Okay.

529
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:02,031
Well, we all thought you were
gonna die.

530
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:05,534
And one night you got really
drunk and we almost had sex and,

531
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:08,604
right before you passed out, you
told me Malory had convinced you

532
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,640
to freeze a bunch of your sperm
at Dr. Feldman's office.

533
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,777
(high-pitched ringing)
And then you didn't die, and

534
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,113
then a few years went by and I
started thinking about having a

535
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,447
baby, but I was single.

536
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,483
And all the other stuff aside,
physically, you're an amazing

537
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:21,750
human being.

538
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,720
And all the other other stuff
aside, I do actually love you.

539
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:26,922
(muffled): And so here's this
viable sample just sitting there

540
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:30,559
at Dr. Feldman's, whose security
system is a joke, by the way.

541
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,928
And so I guess it maybe wasn't
the most ethical thing I've ever

542
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:37,099
done in my entire life, but...

543
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:39,602
(echoing): Archer?

544
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:42,004
Archer.

545
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:45,441
Archer...

546
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:46,675
>> ARCHER: Wuzzat?!

547
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,178
Wait, wait, huh, huh? What?

548
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,579
>> LANA: You okay?

549
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:51,981
>> ARCHER: (exhales) Yeah.

550
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,683
Sorry. For a second, I-I thought
I was just now coming out of a

551
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:58,154
coma from when I drowned, saving
your life eight months ago.

552
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,524
(Archer sighs)
Lana, am I just now coming out

553
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,526
of a coma from when I drowned
saving your life eight months

554
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:04,527
ago?

555
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,528
>> LANA: No.

556
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,830
>> ARCHER: Hmm.

557
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,934
Lana, am I just <i>now</i> coming out
of a coma from when I drowned,

558
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:14,003
saving your life eight months
ago?

559
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,104
>> LANA: No.

560
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,539
>> ARCHER: Then what are you...

561
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,507
Baby, what is she saying?

562
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,676
Baby?

563
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,378
Baby.

564
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,646
Baby!

565
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:29,618
(baby cooing)
>> ARCHER: M-meep.

566
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,022
>> LANA: Sterling Archer, I'd
like you to meet your daughter,

567
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,890
Abbiejean.

568
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:38,794
