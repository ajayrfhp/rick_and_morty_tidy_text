1
00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:03,096
MALORY: Item six.

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,330
EVERYBODY: [ whoa, whoa ]

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,932
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, we're
not done with item five!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,435
MALORY: Well obviously we are,
because I just said "item six."

5
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:12,689
PAM: Where the hell're we supposed to
eat lunch if you close the break room?

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:13,943
MALORY: Wherever you'd like.

7
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,580
As long as it's not Le Cirque,
Lutèce, Elaine's, 21, The

8
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:19,349
Russian Tea Room, or The Palm.

9
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,577
CYRIL: Like we can afford to
eat lunch at any of those.

10
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:22,118
MALORY: All the better.

11
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,720
Saves us all the embarrassment
of my snubbing you.

12
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:25,221
LANA: Malory --

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,722
MALORY: And, shut up, it will

14
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,724
save me God knows how much on

15
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:32,161
exterminators... That
break room is disgusting.

16
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,929
A pig wouldn't be caught dead in there.

17
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:35,231
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah it would.

18
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,067
KRIEGER: Aww, Pigley Two...
MALORY: And you!

19
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:41,237
Mister "I Can Solve Your Ant Problem!"

20
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:44,207
KRIEGER: First of all, it's Doctor
"I Can Solve Your Ant Problem"...

21
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:54,417
KRIEGER: And second of
all, here's your refund.

22
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:55,951
I really thought that would work.

23
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,388
ARCHER: What were you
going for, ant-strength

24
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,756
relative to the size of a human?

25
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:01,391
KRIEGER: Shut up.

26
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:05,728
MALORY: Everyone shut
up, because item six!

27
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:09,865
Talk to Pam today, because somehow,
and seemingly impossibly soon, it is

28
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,036
once again time for... peer reviews.

29
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,470
PAM: Yaaayyyy!

30
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:15,938
LANA: Ugh, how can you not hate those?

31
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,774
PAM: I dunno, maybe I'm the only
one who cares about this being

32
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,743
an efficient and supportive
work environment...

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,644
CHERYL/CAROL: Maybe you're lame.

34
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:23,779
PAM: Maybe you can shut
your dick-holster.

35
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:26,815
So see me after, I've got
everyone paired off.

36
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:28,084
Well, except Ms. Archer.

37
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,792
ARCHER: Wait, why don't
you have to do it?

38
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:33,756
MALORY: Well I would... if I had
a peer in this entire building.

39
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:35,624
Item seven.

40
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:36,092
Oh.

41
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,495
You all remember Lucas Troy...
EVERYBODY: [ groans ]

42
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:40,714
PAM: Shitbag.

43
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:41,864
ARCHER: What're you talking
about, Luke's awesome!

44
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:47,803
He's a kickass agent, a great wingman,
he can drink Ireland under the table...

45
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:50,506
back when we were training
together we tore it up!

46
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,175
MALORY: Just like his ISIS contract!

47
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,677
I trained him for a year, and
the minute he's worth a damn he

48
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,812
goes to work for ODIN?!

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,215
ARCHER: She said, oversimplifyingly!

50
00:01:59,283 --> 00:01:59,915
MALORY: Wh-?!

51
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:04,420
And so, congratulations to all our
new agents, but especially to our

52
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,756
highest-scoring recruit, Lucas Troy!

53
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:08,791
EVERYBODY: [ cheers ]

54
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,126
ARCHER: Way to go Luke!

55
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:13,463
TROY: I'm going to work for ODIN.

56
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,863
ARCHER: He was still awesome.

57
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:15,831
And my best --

58
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,299
LANA: Only --

59
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,300
ARCHER: -- shut up, my best

60
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:20,136
friend, Mother, which is why you
hated him, because you were

61
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:23,439
jealous of our relationship.

62
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:24,841
CYRIL: So, you two were
in a relationship...

63
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:26,175
ARCHER: Wh-?

64
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:28,478
No, not the Ray kind!

65
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:28,978
GILLETTE: Meaning?

66
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,846
ARCHER: Homosexual, Ray.

67
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,848
So, so obviously.

68
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,285
What's not obvious, Mother, is why my
best friend, the awesome Luke Troy,

69
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:38,154
is on your stupid agenda!

70
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:43,910
MALORY: Oh, right, let's see here...
Doo doo doo dooo... oh.

71
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:46,025
He's dead.

72
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:47,893
ARCHER: He's... what?

73
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,031
CHERYL/CAROL: Dead!

74
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,795
Jesus, clean the secretly gay for
Lucas Troy out of your ears.

75

ARCHER: This is crazy,
how could Luke be --

77
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,606
LANA: Gay?
ARCHER: Dead! Lana.

78
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,943
And your little, whatever, gay
innuendos don't even merit a --

79
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,445
PAM: Reach-around?

80
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:38,447
Owww! Jesus!

81
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,316
CHERYL/CAROL: Ha ha!

82
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,617
It's just like my birthday
party all over again.

83
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:43,485
Remember?

84
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:44,319
PAM: Nooo!

85
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:44,853
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah.

86
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,255
Because you weren't invited.

87
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,623
ARCHER: Mother, tell me
exactly what happened!

88
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,726
MALORY: To lure a black market
arms dealer into the open,

89
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:54,796
Troy was posing as a nuclear
scientist who had stolen enough

90
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,798
uranium for a dirty bomb.

91
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,801
ARCHER: Oh, that is
classic Luke the Spook!

92
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:05,240
Hey stupid, here's your fake uranium,
click, handcuffs, drops mic on stage.

93
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,808
MALORY: Yes, that was the plan.

94
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:10,446
But somehow, thanks to what I
just assume is ODIN idiocy,

95
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:12,581
Troy acquired real uranium.

96
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:13,815
ARCHER: Even classic-er!

97
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,452
The bad guys would obviously
bring a Geiger counter!

98
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,020
MALORY: And ten million
dollars in bearer bonds.

99
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,058
And when the smoke had cleared,
four ODIN agents were dead, and

100
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:26,528
the uranium, the bad guys, and
the money had all disappeared.

101
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:27,596
And so had Troy.

102
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,930
ARCHER: Doesn't... prove anything.

103
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:30,966
LANA: Oh for -- Archer, if it
walks like a duck, and quacks

104
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:34,136
like a duck, and murders a
bunch of its fellow ducks...

105
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:37,038
ARCHER: Then maybe the duck
knew there was a mole!

106
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,474
Ever think of that?!

107
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,842
That maybe there's a
fox in the henhouse?!

108
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,844
A wolf in sheep's clothing?!

109
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,846
Or one of the other tricky animals?!

110
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,381
MALORY: Well, we'll never know.

111
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,783
The plane he escaped in
crashed, in Vermont.

112
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,886
ARCHER: What, no, I bet he faked his
own death so he can expose the mole!

113
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,456
LANA: There is no mole, and faked it how?

114
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,458
ARCHER: Paging Dr. Cooper!

115
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:57,993
Dr. D.B. Cooper!

116
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,996
Lana, he obviously bailed out and --
LANA: And then...

117
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,466
landed safely, buried his
chute, ran ten miles to the

118
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:08,303
crash site and then strapped himself
into the still-burning wreckage?

119
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,639
ARCHER: That... that could be anybody.

120
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,974
MALORY: Well, anybody
with his dental records.

121
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:13,675
ARCHER: What?!

122
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:18,180
MALORY: Yes, Sterling, I'm --
actually no, I'm not sorry.

123
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,550
He was a traitor and a thief,
and so I'm glad he's dead.

124
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,384
ARCHER: If he is!

125
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:25,887
Because you've always been
insanely jealous of my friends!

126
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:32,694
ARCHER: So if you'll excuse me,
Mother, I have to go clear

127
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:36,398
the name of an American hero.

128
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,934
MALORY: Does he seem... almost
a little too fond of Troy?

129
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:42,371
LANA: Yeah, and you
know he was gay, right?

130
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:43,772
MALORY: As a tangerine.

131
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,774
In jean shorts.

132
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,682
GILLETTE: But, I thought
Troy was already dead.

133
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,711
ARCHER: Because he wants
you to think that!

134
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:53,014
But I have a list of all his
known aliases, so see if any of

135
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,749
them used a passport!

136
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,218
Oh, or a credit card!

137
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,919
LANA: Yeah, like at roughtrade dot net.

138
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:00,755
ARCHER: Lana, I will hire Kenny
Loggins to come here and

139
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,925
play an acoustic set while I
slap some sense into you.

140
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:04,560
LANA: Pff.

141
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:05,467
Ray, back me up here.

142
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,929
Luke Troy, yes or no, gayest dude ever.

143
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:09,698
GILLETTE: Uh...

144
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,935
TROY: Dude, what, it was just the tip!

145
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:18,540
GILLETTE: Meathead fratboy asshole jock
maybe, but no, definitely not gay.

146
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:19,641
LANA: What?!

147
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,943
ARCHER: Boom!

148
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,044
Sorry.

149
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,112
What.

150
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,946
What?!

151
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:25,914
I knew it!

152
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:26,981
Where is he?!

153
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:30,252
And why don't we leave the
terrace door open, Woodhouse?!

154
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,954
Exactly, because he's a frickin lemur!

155
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,623
Ray, call me when you find a lead!

156
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:38,727
I'll be somewhere in or on top of my
building, shooting tranquilizer darts at

157
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,462
the world's shittiest pet.

158
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,063
LANA: Told him when he bought it.

159
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:44,766
PAM: And I'm telling you these
reviews are mandatory, and

160
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,954
since I outrank you...
OWEN: Hang on, lemme check this

161
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,471
imaginary list of all the
people I report to...

162
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,973
Doo doo doo doo dooooo...

163
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,608
PAM: Okay.

164
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,308
LANA: What the hell is this?

165
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:56,278
PAM: This, mustache on
a penis, is Rodney.

166
00:06:56,346 --> 00:07:00,415
OWEN: And since there's only one name
on this list, you must be Ms. Archer.

167
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,684
Cleverly disguised as a large man.

168
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:03,619
PAM: Meh-heh!

169
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,288
He's the new, whatever, gun librarian.

170
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:07,989
OWEN: Armory supervisor.

171
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,558
LANA: Hooray, what's with the cage?

172
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:13,428
OWEN: Oh, some wacky new thing the kids
are doing, called inventory control?

173
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:17,999
PAM: Ms. Archer's pissed cause a buncha
guns and stuff keep going missing...

174
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:21,336
KRIEGER: Oh, and lemme know
if you want a good deal on a

175
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:22,771
gallon of irradiated ants.

176
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:23,605
LANA: Well, whatever.

177
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:26,007
I need some range time, so just
scuttle back into the tiny

178
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,443
little domain over which you
have power, and get me a

179
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,545
thousand rounds of nine mil, wadcutter.

180
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:31,446
OWEN: Absolutely.

181
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:34,483
Just fill out these requisition
forms, in triplicate.

182
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,983
LANA: Wh-?

183
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,485
For a few lousy bullets?!

184
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,287
OWEN: Well one, they're
excellent bullets--

185
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,021
LANA: Are you gonna stand there,

186
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,891
in what I just assume are
two-inch lifts, and tell me

187
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,662
Archer filled out your stupid forms
just to get a tranquilizer gun?

188
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:47,763
OWEN: No I am not.

189
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,196
LANA: Well?!

190
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:52,301
OWEN: He filled them out to get,
doo doo dooooo, two H&K MP-five,

191
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:55,036
two thousand rounds ammunition
for same, twenty mark-two

192
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,471
fragmentation grenade...

193
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,038
LANA: Wait a minute...

194
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,308
PAM: Yeah, that lemur is hosed.

195
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,043
OWEN: Fourteen days survival
ration, two night vision goggle,

196
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:06,648
two each arctic camouflage parka
and pant, and, doo doo doo doooo,

197
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,049
two pairs snowshoe.

198
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,250
LANA: Son of a bitch!

199
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,254
That phone call was --
ARCHER: Loooooooooooooooke!

200
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:16,325
Dude, I knew you faked your
death because a mole framed you

201
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:18,092
for stealing that uranium!

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,196
TROY: Dude, that is such a relief, I was
worried they turned you against me.

203
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,130
ARCHER: Are you kidding?

204
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:26,067
Dude, bros before... apparent
threats to national security.

205
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,932
TROY: Archer, you sure
you're up for this?

206
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,690
Because this thing... it runs deep.

207
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,892
ARCHER: Dude, I love deep
TROY: Said your mom!

208
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,061
ARCHER: Haa!

209
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,062
Classic you!

210
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,697
Allright, GPS says I'll
be there in four hours.

211
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,699
Don't worry, Luke... I'm coming for you.

212
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,134
TROY: [ Ahh ]

213
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:40,835
ARCHER: What was that?

214
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,184
TROY: Phrasing.

215
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,360
ARCHER: Nice!

216
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,373
Queer!

217
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,808
Wait a -- oh my God, holy shit!

218
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:49,377
No, Vermont has liquor stores.

219
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,695
Right?

220
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:53,982
Yeah they have to, it sucks there.

221
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:57,306
LANA: Cyril, not now.

222
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,541
What's the signal strength
on Archer's cellphone?

223
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,144
CYRIL: The doohickey says he's
about thirty minutes away.

224
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,880
And my point was, we could've
easily done it by now.

225
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:07,282
LANA: And my point, is that
pursuing a dangerous rogue

226
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,353
agent, isn't the optimal
time to do peer reviews!

227
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,222
CYRIL: Coulda done it ten times by now.

228
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,357
LANA: God damn it fine frickin review me!

229
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:16,786
CYRIL: Section one, Team Dynamics.

230
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:19,662
Question one, "Does
employee cooperate with..."

231
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh. These are all "Strongly Disagree."

232
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:28,638
LANA: You --
ARCHER: Pussy!

233
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,205
TROY: Shut up, it went down wrong.

234
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,642
ARCHER: Said your... oh.

235
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,309
TROY: Yeah, doesn't work there.

236
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,879
ARCHER: Mmmmokay, say
"Thanks for coming."

237
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:37,467
TROY: Nooope!

238
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,750
ARCHER: No, seriously, if anybody finds
out I helped you I'll be disavowed.

239
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:41,383
TROY: I know.

240
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:42,584
Dude, I know.

241
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:43,252
Thank you.

242
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,053
ARCHER: For...?

243
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:44,453
TROY: Nope.

244
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,387
ARCHER: God, what a dick.

245
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,388
TROY: Said your mom!

246
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:46,956
Boom!

247
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,590
ARCHER: Dammit!

248
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,290
TROY: So easy...

249
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:49,391
ARCHER: Okay, I got an El Camino

250
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,592
full of rampage here,

251
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,327
so what's the plan?

252
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:55,397
TROY: Right, yes, okay, so, I know
it doesn't look like much now...

253
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,367
But it has tons of potential.

254
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:02,571
ARCHER: As a... base of operations while
we track down the mole who framed

255
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,408
you for murdering your colleagues and
selling uranium on the black market?

256
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:07,543
TROY: No, asshole.

257
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,344
As a bed-and-breakfast.

258
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,213
ARCHER: Uhh...
TROY: Twin Oaks.

259
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,114
You like that?

260
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:13,115
For the name?

261
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,584
Twin Oaks?

262
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:16,752
LANA: Seriously?

263
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,756
CYRIL: Yeah, according to the doohickey
it says Archer's in that direction --

264
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,091
LANA: Are you reading it wrong?

265
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,480
CYRIL: Within two hundred meters.

266
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,760
LANA: I bet you're reading it wrong.

267
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,428
CYRIL: Section two, Interpersonal.

268
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,965
"Does employee frequently
criticize oth --"

269
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,301
CYRIL: Strongly agree.

270
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:33,435
Somewhat disagree?

271
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:34,436
LANA: Somewhat shut up.

272
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,638
Come on, we're going on
foot, through the woods.

273
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,574
I've got a bad feeling about this.

274
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,443
TROY: I know, but imagine
it all fixed up!

275
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:44,413
ARCHER: No, yeah, I mean obviously it's --
TROY: It's gonna be amazing,

276
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,082
dude, look at these floors!

277
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:46,989
That's heart of pine!

278
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,285
ARCHER: Yeah, so look --
TROY: Look at this mantelpiece!

279
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:51,253
Mahogany!

280
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,454
There's another seven!

281
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:55,557
Eight fireplaces, dude,
how nuts is that?!

282
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,427
ARCHER: Pretty nuts...
TROY: Said your mom!

283
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:02,732
ARCHER: Yeahhh... so, um, about
un-framing you for treason and murder...

284
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,468
TROY: Yeah, I dunno, man, it kinda
seems like what's the point, you know?

285
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,270
ARCHER: I don't, actually.

286
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,439
TROY: C'mon, there's too much evidence!

287
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,708
I mean it's all fake, obviously, but...
ARCHER: Exactly!

288
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,777
Dude, there's a mole in your agency!

289
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:15,745
We gotta catch him!

290
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:16,979
TROY: But then what?

291
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,916
Then there's another mole, or a
double agent, on and on, it's

292
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,684
all just secrets and lies, man!

293
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,820
ARCHER: Yeah, it's espionage.

294
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:27,957
TROY: I can't go back to that
world, man, I'm too tired.

295
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:31,861
ARCHER: Hopefully that's just neurological
damage from scraping lead paint...

296
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:32,494
TROY: No, it's --

297
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,483
ARCHER: Because turning

298
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,496
the Munsters' house into a B&B

299
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:37,733
is an insane response to your situation!

300
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,203
It'd be cheaper to build a brand
new house out of actual money!

301
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,639
TROY: Yeah, I know it'll cost
a fortune to fix her up,

302
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,141
but money's not a problem.

303
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,343
ARCHER: Why, wait, why
is money not a problem?

304
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:52,648
TROY: And my situation, is anyone who
could hurt me thinks I'm already dead.

305
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:55,484
ARCHER: I -- wait, and
who was in the plane?

306
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:55,851
TROY: Hm?

307
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,523
ARCHER: I said who was in the goddamn--
TROY: No no no no, what the hell?!

308
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:02,992
LANA: How could you not see that?!

309
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,061
CYRIL: Because I only have two eyes, and
they were busy looking for hunters!

310
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,530
LANA: Why, is it pumpkin season?!

311
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:10,065
CYRIL: Is that a thing?!

312
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,613
TROY: Archer, were you followed here?

313
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,469
ARCHER: Wow, okay, a little insulting.

314
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,539
I think I know how to spot a tail, so --
TROY: Is your... phone on?!

315
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,573
ARCHER: Wh-? No!

316
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:24,546
Jesus, what kind of... wallpaper
are you thinking about?

317
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:28,517
Because how about a textile?

318
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,518
ARCHER: Lana, listen.

319
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,853
LANA: No, you listen!

320
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,155
We're -- [ Airhorn ]

321

ARCHER: Ha ha haa! Leave it!

322

VOICEMAIL LADY: The voice mailbox of...

324

Goodbye.

325
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,601
TROY: Why is Lana Kane -- and is that
the geeky little accountant dude?!

326
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,537
-- attempting to breach my perimeter?!

327
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:52,274
ARCHER: I honestly don't know, but
why are -- you doing that?

328
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:54,503
TROY: Because they are a threat.
ARCHER: No they're not!

329
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,577
TROY: To our future together.

330
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,579
ARCHER: Especially not Cyril!

331
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,382
He's -- wait, I'm sorry,
whose future together?

332
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,584
TROY: Yours and mine, dumbass.

333
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,953
ARCHER: You lost me.

334
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,588
TROY: No, Archer, I thought I had--
ARCHER: No, yeah, you did.

335
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:08,190
TROY: -- but then you came back to me.

336
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,959
ARCHER: Don't take this the wrong way?

337
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:13,595
But I'm getting an extremely gay vibe.

338
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:14,029
TROY: Wh-?

339
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,098
Jesus, dude, I'm not gay!

340
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,599
ARCHER: I --
TROY: For other men!

341
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,600
ARCHER: Lost me again.

342
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,768
TROY: I can't really explain it?

343
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,537
I mean, you know me, I've banged
more hot chicks than I've

344
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:26,876
had hot dinners, but...
There's just something about you.

345
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,543
ARCHER: That... makes you gay for me?

346
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:30,251
TROY: Well, I don't
really like that word?

347
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,214
ARCHER: Well sorry, I
didn't invent English.

348
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:35,417
TROY: It's more like... a
singular samesex attraction.

349
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:38,054
ARCHER: Can I, um, my
head's kinda spinning...

350
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:40,622
TROY: I know, this is a lot to process.

351
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,491
ARCHER: No, literally.

352
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:43,926
TROY: Well, figuratively.

353
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:47,897
If it was literally...
ARCHER: The wine... you drugged the wine?

354
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:51,233
TROY: Yeah, sorry, I thought you might
freak out when I told you all this.

355
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:56,171
ARCHER: Pfff, sunnersannable, I'd do me...
TROY: And also when I told you I

356
00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:00,075
actually did steal the uranium
and murder my fellow agents.

357
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,945
ARCHER: You dick...
TROY: To fund our life together, dude!

358
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:06,448
Which will start right after I
go murder your fellow agents.

359
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,579
ARCHER: Way way way way, hang on.

360
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,080
You had same wine, how you not get drug?

361
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,837
TROY: Coated the inside of the glass.

362
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,222
ARCHER: Heh!

363
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,821
Classic you!

364
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:23,891
PAM: Well this is a frickin disaster!

365
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,725
MALORY: I know.

366
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:28,733
When Ron said we were going on a
cruise, I almost vomited blood.

367
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:31,521
PAM: No. Nobody's doing
their peer reviews!

368
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,422
MALORY: Pam, the word "disaster"

369
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,692
implies it's something
that actually matters.

370
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,993
PAM: It matters to me!

371
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,862
MALORY: Well, but you don't.

372
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,498
PAM: Well then maybe instead of
doing my job I'll go hang out

373
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,501
in Vermont with Luke Troy
and all the other assholes!

374
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:46,102
MALORY: What?!

375
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,236
PAM: Oops.

376
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,373
MALORY: Trace Sterling's phone, and
scramble every available field agent!

377
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,142
I want them all converging
on his location!

378
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,879

CHERYL/CAROL: There's only like

two of 'em.

380
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,415
PAM: So why are these damn
peer reviews so hard?!

381
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:05,588
Only like ten people work in this
whole goddamn chickenshit outfit!

382
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,255
Sorry.

383
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,244
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't be.

384
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,358
It is a chickenshit outfit.

385
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:10,793
CYRIL: Look, for your information?

386
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:14,731
Blaze orange is the safest color to wear
to avoid being accidentally shot at.

387
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:18,701
LANA: What about intentionally shot at?!

388
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,439

LANA: Oh for -- seriously?!

C'mon, you're not thinking straight!

395
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:44,393
A, you wildly underestimated my
liver's ability to metabolize toxins!

396
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:48,798
And B, why would you possibly have these?

397
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,768
LANA: Because I'm not the idiot
who took his idiot clothes off!

Did you kill him?!

404
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,415
TROY: He's fine.

405
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:07,650
Unlike your aim.

406
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,652
Guess you never learned
how to shoot, huh?

407
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,319

CYRIL: Strongly agree.

00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,858

00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,329
CYRIL: Truckasaurus?

417
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,197
LANA: Cyril?

418
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:24,533

LANA: Dammit!

LANA: Uh, Cyril?

422

But accurate.

424
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:36,345
Again, unlike your aim.

it was weird that you only ever

468
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,547
Actually no, that was... far and away the
best thing that ever happened to me.

469
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:23,019
So as much as I'd like to, I don't
think now's an optimal time for that.

470
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,121
LANA: Aww, really?

471
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,390
CYRIL: I mean, if you
think we have time...

472
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:27,590
LANA: Cyril!

473
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:28,157
CYRIL: Ahh!

474
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,458
Yeah we don't have time!

475
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,460
LANA: Not for this, dickbrain.

476
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,161
For that.

477
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:36,065
CYRIL: What, what is... oh. Ohh, okay!

478
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,054
LANA: But do get naked.

479
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:37,934
Panties too.

480
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,468
CYRIL: Yeah, they're called briefs?

481
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,338
LANA: Yeah, you're a grown man?

482
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,473
ARCHER: Yeah, that's our Lana.

483
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,611
Let's see, so judging from the shell
ejection she was firing at...

484
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:51,647
What I really hope was not an ent.

485
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,351
Because that is like the
last thing we need.

486
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:56,485
An entmoot.

487
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,922
Oh my God what if I'm gay for Tolkien?

488
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,623
TROY: Dude.

489
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,292
Seriously, not that it's gonna
matter in thirty seconds...

490
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,627
But what is your problem?

491
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:08,097
CYRIL: Well, besides Lana ditching me...
TROY: For what, an entmoot?

492
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,266
Ya know, cause she's got
those big-ass tree-hands?

493
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,601
CYRIL: I'd have to go with hypothermia.

494
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,938
TROY: Well, I know a cure for that...
CYRIL: Oh my God, not in my face!

495
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,141
TROY: Said your mom, BOOM!

496
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,643
Sorry, that's terrible to
hear that right before you...

497
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,444
What in the... hell... is...?

498
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,013
LANA: Well, you know what they say.

499
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,515
Big hands... Big dick.

500
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,517
TROY: Noooooooooo!

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,121
LANA: Ew.
CYRIL: Gross.

502
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:32,789
ARCHER: Luke?!

503
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:33,355
LANA: Archer?!

504
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,824
ARCHER: Shut up, Luke?!

505
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:35,825
TROY: Archer?

506
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,326
Oh dude, is it bad?

507
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:40,263
ARCHER: There's a... kind of
a lot of blood down there.

508
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,530
TROY: Said your mom.

509
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,665
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

510
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:43,532
ARCHER: Seriously.

511
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,067
TROY: No, for everything.

512
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:49,672
The uranium, killing my fellow
agents, that hobo I set on fire

513
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:53,209
after I paid him to get his teeth
drilled to match my dental records?

514
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,677
Jesus, the dentist?

515
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:57,046
ARCHER: God damn, dude.

516
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:57,914
TROY: I know.

517
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:01,383
But I only did it because I wanted
us to be together, forever.

518
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:01,851
LANA: Called it.

519
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,853
TROY: I've loved you
since the day we met.

520
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:09,158
So mostly I'm sorry for... remember
that training mission in the D.R.?

521
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,895
ARCHER: Uh... yeah, tap-and-trace
on the Cuban embassy.

522
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,031
Then we got shit-housed on mamajuana.

523
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:18,234
TROY: And then you
passed out in your room.

524
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,536
ARCHER: Um... yeah...

525
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:22,238
TROY: Well, after you

526
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,572
passed out, I --

527
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,373
ARCHER: Luke?

528
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,574
If you really do love me?

529
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,575
TROY: You know I do.

530
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,845
ARCHER: Then please don't
finish that sentence.

531
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:29,445
TROY: Dude.

532
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,633
It's my deathbed confession.

533
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,723
C'mon, I'm dying.

534
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:35,156
ARCHER: Well I'm not, so please, don't --
TROY: After you passed out.

535
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:38,059
I snuck into your room with a
big bottle of suntan oil, put

536
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:44,766
on some Al Green, and...
ARCHER: Noooooooooooooooooooooo!

537
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,549
ARCHER: Can we have the radio?

538
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:08,667
