1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,130
Because this is what
was there, lana!

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,642
There where?
Outside a clown college?

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,676
They have those here? I don't know!

4
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,003
Archer, look out!

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,190
Ugh! We'll never catch
him in this thing.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,750
Maybe you should've thought
about that before you

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,058
Blew the damn drop.

8
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,540
I blew jack shit!

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,533
Name dropper.

10
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,442
And if you weren't so busy
trying to bang that waitress...

11
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,930
Oh, for --...You would've noticed
that odin had agents in play.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,076
She was the hostess!

13
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:33,325
If you weren't blinded by jealousy.

14
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,554
Okay, yes, I'm jealous.

15
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:35,395
First step's admitting it.

16
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,426
Jealous that odin's
gonna beat us again...

17
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,490
Odin!Thanks to your
epic poonhoundery.

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,486
First of all, lana --

19
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:47,908
Great. Good job. Shut up!

20
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:50,208
Odin doesn't beat sterling archer.

21
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,432
Only sterling archer beats --

22
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,872
Did you want to
finish that thought?

23
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:59,828
Did you want to finish
shutting your big, fat,

24
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,613
Negative, wordsy mouth?

25
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,276
Whose fat mouth told the stupid
waitress he was an isis agent?

26
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:05,067
Hostess!

27
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:05,926
And I had a plan.

28
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:07,650
What? To get laid in the walk-in?

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,268
Also, because I'm
not an ant, lana...

30
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:12,880
...I happen to see the big picture.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,004
Oh, really? Well, then, where's...

32
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,144
...Kasparov?

33
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,275
Okay, that was a fluke.

34
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,543
Yeah, a fluke of nature
because I happen to have

35
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:23,897
Perfect situational
awareness, lana...

36
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:25,830
Archer....Which cannot be taught,
by the way...

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,006
Archer....Like a poet's...
Mind for...

38
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,932
Archer....To make the perfect word.

39
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,288
Archer! God damn it!

40
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:33,250
I'm relishing --

41
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,260
Way to go, lana. Nice warning.

42
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,498
Nice relishing. Ow.

43
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:45,291
Think that was odin? Nah,
it's only you that beats you, buddy.

44
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,232
Ha ha ha.

45
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,126
Hey, gang.

46
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:48,176
Barry.

47
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,184
Gee, thanks for helping
us catch kasparov.

48
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:52,644
Odin appreciates the assist. Yeah.

49
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:55,059
And if you ever get tired
of playing j.V. Ball,

50
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:56,174
You know where to find us.

51
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,612
Oh, yeah? Uh, where's that?

52
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,398
Uh, dicktown?

53
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,773
Jesus, even their cards are nice.

54
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:05,027
Lana, look at this -
it's embossed.

55
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,424
Oh, okay.

56
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,414
Then, I guess just pout.

57
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,304
Oui.

58
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,279
Oui, je sais, mais --

59
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,725
Oui. Au revoir.

60
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,741
That was the mayor of paris.
Name dropper.

61
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,738
Who is just as eager as I
am to know why isis agents

62
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,072
Were terrorizing paris!

63
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:57,613
So, I crashed a few cop cars,
ran over a few mimes.

64
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,997
So, I don't play by the rules,
mother, but I get results.

65
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,226
Well, as long as you got kasparov.

66
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,078
Oh, uh, yeah, about that.

67
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,874
That's why she can't
have nice things.

68
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:10,660
either that, or I steal them. Hmm?

69
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,575
what? What's that?

70
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,715
what? What do you want, pam?

71
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:13,996
'cause I'm a little
busy for chit-chat.

72
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:15,600
Busy trying to turn that thing on?

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,491
look at this! O-n -- nothing!

74
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,685
Well, just keep at it.

75
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,236
you're not my supervisor.

76
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,362
I'm sorry -- what?!

77
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:24,524
He sort of offered
me a job at odin.

78
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:27,145
Barry dillon? Barry "We
have this whole huge

79
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,367
History together" Dillon?

80
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,667
We don't have this
whole huge history.

81
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,380
Oh, my god.

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,044
Barry. Sweet, huh?

83
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:37,288
Using a mirror to reflect the
laser beam back into the laser?

84
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:38,707
Yeah. Oh, my god.

85
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:39,801
Sorry it took so long.

86
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:42,076
And that I'm
accidentally inside you.

87
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,162
Not a problem.

88
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,377
I-I just want to keep my options

89
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,947
Open, so you can't breathe a

90
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,092
Word of this to malory.

91
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:50,706
You know how she gets.

92
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:53,494
Odin?! Well, since I'm
not appreciated here.

93
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,417
What's to appreciate? Exactly.

94
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,107
I mean, that's indicative of

95
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:58,218
Your whole attitude, mother.

96
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:01,124
Sterling malory archer, you are...

97
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,519
Of course free to
pursue your options.

98
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,576
Wait, hang on.

99
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:08,135
And if odin made you a
better offer, what kind of

100
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:11,001
Mother would I be if I stood
in the way of your happiness?

101
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,799
Uh...Wait, what just happened here?

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,632
Fine! She thinks I won't go?!

103
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,668
Well, guess what! I don't need her!

104
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,457
I, however, do need your keycard.

105
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,445
Yeah, hi. Barry dillon, ease.

106
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,643
Yes, I'll hold!

107
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,178
Oh, d just wait till I get to odin.

108
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,440
I will! Keycard?

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,571
Oh. Here! God!

110
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,875
They are the
stuff-throng-est family.

111
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,787
okay, so, after I
call your vase guy...

112
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,797
Freeze every one of his accounts!

113
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,474
And then get me woodhouse.Am

114
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,244
And we'll just see how tough

115
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:42,255
Sterling is when he
can't suckle at my teat!

116
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:46,271
Woodhouse, she froze my accounts,
and I need to get

117
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,447
In my safe, so open the
goddamn door already!

118
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,793
I'm afraid I can't,
since isis actually pays

119
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,401
The rent on the -- damn it!

120
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,069
En did we get a bulletproof door?!

121
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,203
After the popeye incident, sir.

122
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,049
Oh, right.

123
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,911
Wait, so you kick me
out of e own house?!

124
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:03,553
Yes, sir.

125
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,779
Although it pains me dearly.

126
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,069
I'm gonna pain you dearly,
woodhouse, when I peel

127
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,212
All your skin off with a

128
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:10,647
Flensing knife, sew it into

129
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,325
Woodhouse pajamas, and then

130
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,204
Set those pajamas on fire!

131
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:17,461
Hello?

132
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:19,602
It's just you and me now, reggie.

133
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:22,574
So be a lad? Put on some mingus?

134
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,632
Hi, barry dillon, please?

135
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,099
Yes, it's sterling arch--

136
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:28,111
Ohh. Yes, I'll hold!

137
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,371
Oh! Come on.

138
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,219
We've got mi6 in the semis on

139
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,696
Sunday, and I am slicing
it like a butcher.

140
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,768
Just keep at it. trexler:
I think it's this new grip.

141
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:38,867
So, listen, remember

142
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,647
How you wanted me to float that

143
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,659
Job offer to lana kane?

144
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,659
Love her! Yeah!

145
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,093
When does she start?
That's the thing.

146
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,571
See, I think sterling archer

147
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,008
Thought I was talking to him.

148
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,861
Archer?! You're kidding.

149
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,667
Yeah, I wish.

150
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,645
Mean, obviously the guy's
great in the field.

151
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:54,902
You would know.

152
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,059
Now see? Why do you do that?

153
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,923
Why do you softball
'em in like that?

154
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,775
I'm sorry. How's the leg?

155
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,175
Hurts when it rains...

156
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:06,107
And when I think about archer,
and so I blew him off.

157
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,038
No, no, no, no, barry,
you blow him on!

158
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,215
"On" As in hire him? As in here?

159
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:12,675
Yes.

160
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,165
It'll drive his mother crazy.Ob

161
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:20,293
Gotta be the grip.

162
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,927
And you froze all of
sterling's accounts?

163
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,677
Domestic and foreign?

164
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:29,503
even the one on the isle of man.

165
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,485
Oh, my god, and is that like

166
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,985
Whore island for women? Nope.

167
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,667
Then you just watch.

168
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,988
In no time, he'll be begging
me to take him back.

169
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,798
He hasn't called, has he? Nope.

170
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,401
How ya holdin' up, mama bird?

171
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,215
Well, except for your grossly
over-familiar tone, I

172
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,527
Couldn't be happier!

173
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,921
even if mr.
Archer gets a job at odin?

174
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,659
Please! Odin won't hire him.

175
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,153
After the stunt he
pulled in berlin?

176
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,618
Well, whose fault is that?

177
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,183
Yours! You bust in,
shoot two perfectly

178
00:06:58,183 --> 00:06:59,158
Good double agents --

179
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:02,044
And you think an appropriate
response is to ruin my suit?

180
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,300
Oh, and my shirt! I'm sorry.

181
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,849
So, will you please
just help me up?!

182
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:09,307
No.

183
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:12,029
...For which I am
pretty genuinely sorry.

184
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,641
Nothing two steel rods

185
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,269
And 16 titanium
screws couldn't fix.

186
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,730
Ah, come on, don't be shitty.

187
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,264
Yeah, barry. trexler:
It's water under the bridge.

188
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:23,415
Get over it. Because he
is part of the family now.

189
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,951
So go put his stuff in his office.

190
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,829
Yeah, barry.

191
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,779
Barry, hi!

192
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:32,139
So, I was wondering if your
tempting offer was still open.

193
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,785
No, you silly man!

194
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,494
About the job.

195
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,103
No, just...Keeping my options open.

196
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,309
Definitely come in.

197
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,763
I mean, we did kind of
fill the position, but...

198
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,808
I don't know if it's
gonna be a good fit.

199
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,289
I just don't see why you need this.

200
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,769
Because this is a huge

201
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,608
Opportunity for me, and I need

202
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,404
To feel confident.

203
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:57,696
In the interview.

204
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:01,111
Oh, that looks great!

205
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,305
Yeah, it feels pretty Good.

206
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,252
Come on, already. Take a cut.

207
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:05,375
What, like, out the window?

208
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,481
Don't worry about it -
I get a deal on those.

209
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,660
90 cents a ball.

210
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,045
Uh, okay.

211
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,864
God, you're a natural!

212
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,410
Bet it's all that lacrosse
at boarding school, huh?

213
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,655
Yeah, 13 years' worth.

214
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,515
13 years?!

215
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:22,277
What, did she ship you
off in kindergarten?!

216
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:23,879
Gosh, that must've been tough.

217
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,539
No, I-I-I loved it.

218
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,713
Uh...Made a lot of good friends.

219
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,005
Family, almost, is what they were.

220
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,567
Speaking of --

221
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,207
How's your mother taking all this?

222
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,825
Oh, please. I bet she
doesn't even miss me.

223
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:42,491
Because he'll be back,
crying for his mommy!

224
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,909
Just like that christmas break

225
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,420
When I moved and forgot to give

226
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,236
My new address to his
stupid boarding school.

227
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,542
I mean, he rode the train into

228
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,949
The city all by himself.

229
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,914
He couldn't pick up a phone book?

230
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,855
9 years old, and bawling in

231
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:57,242
That police station
like a little girl!

232
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,123
Ha! What's that tell you?

233
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,543
kind of a lot, actually.
Oh, shut up.

234
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:02,852
I bet you're barren.

235
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,623
My god. On christmas?

236
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:06,411
Well, christmas eve, technically.

237
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,551
Well, the lovely framboise

238
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,715
From h.R. Has some
paperwork for you to sign.

239
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:13,044
'allo! 'allo.

240
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,217
why don't you follow her on down to

241
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,568
Your big new corner office...

242
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:20,283
Okay. trexler:...Where the
sofa is soaked in scotchgard.

243
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,889
If you know what I'm -- yeah,
I think I do.

244
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,207
It's resistant to stains.

245
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,397
Right, right, i got it.

246
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:30,187
Super! 'cause we're one big family.

247
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,463
Why do you make that sound?

248
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:33,219
Gee, let's see.

249
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,550
You're off to interview with

250
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,479
Odin, ho oy f barr a"Oh, I

251
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,561
Forgot to mention the whole

252
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,921
Naked laser thing" Dillon!

253
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:40,181
Odin isn't some co-ed

254
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,662
Freshman dorm where everyone

255
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:42,963
Runs around screwing!

256
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:45,288
I'm sorry, framboise. It's not you.

257
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,813
I mean, it's not me, either.

258
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:47,838
Obviously.

259
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,983
But in the office?

260
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,043
You don't sex on the women at isis?

261
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,532
Constantly!
But it's not allowed, and

262
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:54,899
Actually, it's probably illegal.

263
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,787
But here -- framboise:
Here we are one big famille.

264
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:01,376
Yeah, and the, uh,
famille thing actually makes

265
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,309
This borderline creepy.

266
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,561
Perhaps if you tried
it from behind?

267
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,560
Yeah, let's try that.

268
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,027
Don't get any on that snappy suit.

269
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,047
Don't you have better things to

270
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,875
Do than mince around and gawk?!

271
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,191
About a million.

272
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:16,612
But cheryl was scared to come in

273
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:18,235
Here, so I took time out of my

274
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,548
Busy "Mincing schedule" To tell

275
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,178
You that you have a phone call.

276
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,562
Is it sterling?!

277
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:25,484
I am sure I don't know.

278
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,794
Do you know you're a little bitch?

279
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,083
Will you remember
this conversation?

280
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,643
Probably not, no.

281
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:31,999
Well, then... Off.

282
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
with the language!

283
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:35,410
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

284
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,943
You leave bub out of this!

285
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:39,443
And how dare you steal
my son away from me!

286
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,131
Steal him? You cut him loose.

287
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,884
You cut him loose! trexler: What?

288
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:45,042
I want you to fire
him this instant.

289
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,084
I can't do that. He's happy here.

290
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,083
He's making new friends.

291
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,917
God damn it, archer!

292
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,329
What, barry? I said,
"Don't come in here."

293
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,742
Framboise, what'd I say?

294
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,415
He said do not come in.

295
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:57,631
Yeah, barry.

296
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,223
I don't care if he's happy!

297
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,789
Well, that's obvious.
Meaning what?!

298
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:02,437
Meaning who leaves a

299
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,980
9-year-old kid in a police

300
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,058
Station on christmas?! Eve!

301
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,151
And he told you about that?

302
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:09,449
Oh, we've have such great talks.

303
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,042
Fire him! trexler: Join him!

304
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,402
Come work for me!

305
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,022
Have you lost your mind?!

306
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,685
Every time I see you.

307
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,579
Fire him. trexler: Can't do it.
Can't or won't?

308
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,819
Either? Fine.

309
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,703
Then go check your telex.

310
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,350
Oh, my god. Look at that.

311
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,266
A burn notice?

312
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,399
"Isis disavows agent sterling archer,
a.K.A. Duchess..."

313
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,817
Man, she loved that dog.

314
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,800
"...Who is to be considered
an unreliable asset

315
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,133
And security risk."

316
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,363
Oh, it must've killed
her to do this.

317
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,003
And I'm smirking.

318
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,105
No, you don't smirk

319
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,602
At a mother's suffering, barry,

320
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,264
You asshole! Ow!

321
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,786
It's just with the shattered

322
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,720
Femur and the gunshot wound

323
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,008
And -- I don't know if you knew

324
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:52,799
This -- but framboise and
I were kind of engaged.

325
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,115
I did not know that!

326
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,779
Yeah. trexler: And I served
her up like a pudding.

327
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,017
Well, engaged to be engaged.

328
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:00,555
Ow!

329
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,510
Ass! If you love it,
put a ring on it.

330
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,577
Okay, so -- okay, you go fix this.

331
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:06,095
You know, I'm not
even sure I want to.

332
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:07,833
She was obviously into him.

333
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,085
Ugh! Come on!

334
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,888
Ass! Not framboise! Archer!

335
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:11,756
The burn notice?

336
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,232
His mother obviously
just sent that to --

337
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,665
To every agency on the planet.

338
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,438
Look at this -- c.I.
A., mi6, interpol.

339
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,772
We can't keep him now, barry!

340
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,301
Oh, so...

341
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:21,588
So you take him to the basement.

342
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,096
You put one in his ear.

343
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,475
Can you do that?

344
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,499
Oh, my god!

345
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,973
That framboise is a freak,
huh? Yeah.

346
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,689
No, as a matter of fact,
I don't have barry on speed dial.

347
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,621
Well, gee,
that's rather surprising.

348
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,806
You know what's surprising?

349
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:42,709
Kissing you goodbye at the

350
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,267
Airport, dozing off in first

351
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,718
Class, and then seeing you on my

352
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,394
Flight when I get up to pee!

353
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:49,378
That, to me, is rather surprising.

354
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,719
And really expensive, turns out.

355
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,468
Just --

356
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,306
Seriously.

357
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:56,238
I mean, I don't want to sound

358
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:58,397
Like a jerk, but that framboise

359
00:12:58,397 --> 00:12:59,731
Chick must've been a prostitute

360
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,358
Before she got this gig.

361
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,639
In, like, bangkok.

362
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,520
I was almost embarrassed for her.

363
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,722
Where we going, anyway?

364
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:08,212
We're headed down to
sub-basement 3 for a minute.

365
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:09,031
Is there a shower down there?

366
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,901
'cause I bet I just reek of her.

367
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,268
One second. Dillon.

368
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:14,423
Barry, you getting that?

369
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:16,031
Really? Yeah.

370
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:17,779
I'm brushing it your way, pal.

371
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,132
No, I'm actually at
the lobby right now.

372
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,379
O s.Secondba wait,
where are we on that shower?

373
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,047
Maybe head on back
up to your office.

374
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,083
'cause there's actually, like, a

375
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,287
Private bathroom in there.

376
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,234
Oh, good, 'cause like

377
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:29,459
I said, I bet I just reek.

378
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:31,806
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

379
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:32,492
But I -- no!

380
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:33,619
Baby, I am putting you in the

381
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,973
Corner, where you will sit quietly.

382
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,796
Hey, you! Hey, you!

383
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:39,273
And who are you?

384
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:42,062
Cyril figgis,
isis comptroller and...

385
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:44,466
...Very eager to sit here
quietly in the corner

386
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,439
Because he is so tired. Um, so...

387
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,321
I'll just be here, then.

388
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,983
Yep? Yep!

389
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,530
No! No! No!

390
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,109
Who put out a burn
notice on sterling?!

391
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:58,197
That would be you. What?!

392
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,801
Holy shit, the look on your face.

393
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:01,912
But I would never!

394
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,593
Not in a million -- get a mirror.

395
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,891
Oh, dear god.

396
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,139
Did I drink absinthe?

397
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,107
That bottle and most of this one.

398
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,979
Until we wrestled it away from you.

399
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,704
'cause you don't know
how to share, biotch!

400
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,432
Easy, tough guy.

401
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:16,404
I don't remember any of that.

402
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,819
Absinthe makes me black out.

403
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,248
All right, ya yellow sons
of bitches, let's dance!

404
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,384
It also makes you incredibly mean.

405
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,678
and ugly!

406
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:32,138
Seriously. biotch.

407
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:32,798
Danger zone.

408
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,183
Well, don't just sit there!
Undo this!

409
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,790
Ooh. "Ooh" What?!

410
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,357
We can't, ms. Archer.

411
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:40,161
It's too late.

412
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,121
I'm sorry, so --

413
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:42,941
What are you saying?

414
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:44,964
Uh -- can you not
give me a minute?!

415
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,669
No! You fire me, I take my things!

416
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:48,731
Take all the things!

417
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,320
Here, take this!

418
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,296
Go staple my heart back together!

419
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,880
Ton coeur?! Tu n'as pas un coeur!

420
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,855
How am I the bad guy in this?!

421
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,122
So, barry...

422
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,184
That was framboise,
our head of h.R.

423
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,110
With whom I guess I
won't be meeting?

424
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,014
No, she's gone.

425
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:06,519
And so, remember how I said
we'd just hired someone?

426
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,033
Yes. And so,
remember sterling archer?

427
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,966
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

428
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,081
Barry, if you touch me,

429
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,219
I swear to god I will
put you in the ground.

430
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,536
That was before his

431
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,202
Mother put out a
burn notice on him.

432
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,196
Wha--?! Malory burned archer?

433
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:21,794
Worldwide. Holy shit.

434
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,875
Yeah, so he's gone. Already?!

435
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,325
Like literally gone?!

436
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,307
Oh, my god.

437
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,773
I liked her better mean. He's gone!

438
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:36,521
I killed my baby boy,
and now my baby is gone!

439
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,014
Oh, now.

440
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,933
You can always... Always what?!

441
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,461
Well, I was gonna say you
can have another baby,

442
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,419
But...You're all dried up in there.

443
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,683
No, no, no.
Like, figuratively gone.

444
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:54,324
Unlike framboise, whose car
should be blowing up any minute.

445
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,936
Uh, excusez-moi, mademoelle.

446
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,429
'allo! May I help you...

447
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,823
Avec your box?

448
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,317
So archer's still here?

449
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,767
Yeah, he's in that corner office.

450
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,861
And once facilities cleans his

451
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:10,129
Brains out of it,
it can be your office.

452
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,210
Really? Yeah, I don't think

453
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,020
The regular cleaning
staff does brains.

454
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,085
No, I mean, you shoot

455
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,398
Him, and I get an office

456
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,976
And the bank where

457
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,245
You'll drive your new company

458
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,326
Car to deposit your insane

459
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:22,670
Paychecks, and maybe, if you

460
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,251
Stand on those tiptoes,
your huge apartment.

461
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,510
"Huge" As in...?

462
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,593
As in you won't see

463
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:30,425
Your live-in servants
unless you really want to.

464
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,011
All right, let me
go shoot this prick.

465
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:33,480
Wait. Let me do it.

466
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,746
Really? 'cause I would
kind of love to.

467
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,478
Not as much as I would.

468
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:38,859
You guys kind of
have a history, huh?

469
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,851
Yeah. You could say that.

470
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:41,871
Knock yourself out.

471
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,091
So, hey, these servants -
if I did see them,

472
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,362
Would they curtsy meekly?

473
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,370
Well, otherwise, I mean,
what's the point?

474
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,079
Archer! Oh, come on.

475
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,305
Lana, why the hell are --

476
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lana, no!

477
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:00,534
Barry, does this make
up for framboise?

478
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:01,994
It does, other barry.

479
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:03,326
It sure does.

480
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,197
Barry?

481
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:06,612
I guess go ahead and call
facilities or whatever.

482
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,847
Because there is lamp everywhere.Co

483
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:11,935
God, lana!

484
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,713
Get on with your life already!

485
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:16,015
Argh! Telex! You got one in here?!

486
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,639
Why, so you can smash that, too?

487
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:18,461
No. 'cause I'm pretty

488
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,191
Sure I'm financially responsible

489
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:21,173
For the furnishings!

490
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,357
So I can send a telex

491
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:23,825
From odin to make the burn

492
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,393
Notice from your mother look

493
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:26,779
Like an odin black flag!

494
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,683
Mother burned me? lana: Apparently.

495
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,591
Oh, my god, that's Classic her.

496
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,947
You're both classic her.

497
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:33,043
Now shut up, get dressed, and

498
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:34,965
Grab the keys to that company car.

499
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,045
We've got about two minutes

500
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:37,666
Before some odin dick sees this

501
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,769
And seals the exits.

502
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,811
Any way we can bump that to five?

503
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,399
I seriously need a shower.

504
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,103
Archer! archer: Okay, god!

505
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,222
Climb down off that rag.

506
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,317
Oh, my god.

507
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,283
Looks like jonestown in here.

508
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:50,672
Yes, pam, get me some

509
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:54,033
Poison, because I am
already dead inside.

510
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,123
Too dead inside to read good news?

511
00:17:56,123 --> 00:17:57,477
Is it my obituary?

512
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,843
Well, it's not that good.

513
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:00,751
Give me that, you oaf!

514
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,941
"All agencies, disregard isis

515
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:07,731
Burn notice on agent archer, a.
K.A. Duchess --"

516
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,585
An odin black flag operation!

517
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,201
Pam, he's alive!

518
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,052
My sterling is alive!

519
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,902
Aw, and look at happy
little mama bird!

520
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,701
Well, the blowback on odin
for this will be huge,

521
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,851
And I saw it coming. Uh-huh.

522
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,715
I knew it.

523
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,153
Just like I knew sterling would

524
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,667
Come crying back to mommy,

525
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,501
Wiping his snotty nose on his

526
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,261
Sleeve like a scared
little boy on christmas.

527
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,062
Uh-huh. malory: Eve.

528
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,569
It was only christmas eve. I know.

529
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,197
Good to have you back.
malory: And? And?

530
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,450
And do you just plan

531
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,617
To loom over me all day,
like some sort of...Henge?

532
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,741
Okay.

533
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:47,134
You see? This is why.

534
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,539
This is why we can't have nice

535
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,728
Things, barry, you asshole!

536
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,951
How am I the bad guy in this?

537
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:57,044
Because I wanted this, archer.

538
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,132
I'm sick of you getting the best

539
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:00,416
Assignments st because
your mother's the boss.

540
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,887
Do you know what that's like?!

541
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:04,915
Besides awesome? lana: Rrr!

542
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,133
Hang on. I think my car's on p-2.

543
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,222
Well, I have to get cyril,
who's on...

544
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,341
Framboise. framboise: 'allo!

545
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,723
Hello? cyril: Hello.

546
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:13,836
Oh, man.

547
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:15,624
That's bad.

548
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:19,941
Yes, now! Let's talk this out.

549
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,118
Talk what out?!

550
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,523
How you ruined my
chance to work for odin?

551
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:24,942
Or -- ooh! -- Maybe how I just

552
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,842
Caught my boyfriend balls
deep in some french chick!

553
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:30,017
Ex-boyfriend, I bet.
lana: Ya think?!

554
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:31,930
Yeah, he's not coming back.

555
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,152
Archer.

556
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,598
Sorry, I know this is tough.

557
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,506
I mean cyril, whatever, but your

558
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,871
Feelings for me are
obviously conflicted.

559
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:41,940
You're right, archer.

560
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,423
I am conflicted. archer: Yeah.

561
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:44,175
Because if I had shot

562
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,654
You in the face, I'd be living

563
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,468
Here, getting curtsied
at by servants!

564
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:50,271
Yeah, but you couldn't do it.

565
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:53,261
maybe -- maybe we
both belong at isis,

566
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:55,328
You know? Maybe
that's our real home.

567
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,292
That's what mother said
about boarding school.

568
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,081
I'm really sorry about cyril.

569
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,109
Yeah, me too.

570
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:01,394
Even if you broug it on yourself.

571
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:02,869
Excuse me? archer: Oh, come on.

572
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,833
I don't recall ever seeing a

573
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,567
Welcome mat at your back door.

574
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,680
Archer. archer: But -- wait,
would that cheer you up?

575
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,931
Me and you, a little revenge anal?

576
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,470
Archer. archer: Yes?

577
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,523
You wearing a seat belt?

578
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:13,761
Uh, no, wh--

579
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,661
Lana-a-a-a!

580
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,486
So, uh, is that a yes?

581
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,985
Or a maybe or...?

582
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:24,607
What?

583
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,953
Oh, okay.

584
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,802
Then, I guess just pout.

585
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:38,803
