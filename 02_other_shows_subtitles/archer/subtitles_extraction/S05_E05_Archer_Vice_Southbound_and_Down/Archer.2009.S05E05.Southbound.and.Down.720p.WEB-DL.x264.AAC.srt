>> KRIEGER: Okay, specs

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,493
are all in the green.

3
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:05,095
So, let me just reboot the

4
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:07,564
CPU, and...

5
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,232
Beep boop, you are no longer

6
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,267
a cripple.

7
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,268
>> RAY: One, two, three,

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,302
Go Herd.

9
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,303
>> KRIEGER: Well?

10
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,271
>> RAY: Well?

11
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,272
Well, you could've done this

12
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,306
weeks ago!

13
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,607
So it's about goddamn time!

14
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,609
>> KRIEGER: Ooh, hang on a sec?

15
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:20,744
(Ray yells)

16
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:22,579
Yeah, touchy thing, bionics.

17
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,947
You were saying?

18
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:24,982
>> RAY: Thank you.

19
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,083
>> KRIEGER: No, what were you

20
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,117
saying like you meant it?

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,318
>> RAY: Thank you, Krieger,

22
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,586
for once again giving me the

23
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,355
precious gift of legs.

24
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,456
>> KRIEGER: You're welcome.

25
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,257
>> RAY: Now, if you will excuse

26
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,258
me, I need to remove my

27
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,094
underwear with a blowtorch.

28
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:38,195
>> MALORY: Ha!

29
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:39,596
Perfect, this is absolutely

30
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,365
perfect.

31
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,466
Cherlene!

32
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:43,467
>> CYRIL: Ow! God!

33
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,468
Come on!

34
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,469
>> LANA: Seriously, thanks for

35
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,503
the deaf baby.

36
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,138
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up. Cher...

37
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,272
>> CHERLENE: What?!

38
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,675
Goddamn, woman, inside voice!

39
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,642
>> MALORY: How...

40
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,644
would you, my little country

41
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,279
songbird, like to be on

42
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,614
Travis County Limits?

43
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:58,615
>> CYRIL: Ooh, is that like

44
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,783
Austin City Limits?

45
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,351
>> MALORY: It's comparable,

46
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,486
hush. Cherlene?

47
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:03,453
>> CHERLENE: I don't know.

48
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:04,488
I guess.

49
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,455
>> MALORY: You...

50
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:07,290
would be wonderful, and it would

51
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,658
be wonderful publicity, and...

52
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,659
wonderful.

53
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,694
(groans)

54
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,695
>> CHERLENE: All right.

55
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,662
When is it?

56
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,663
>> MALORY: Tapes tomorrow night,

57
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:14,664
but we should leave today.

58
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,665
I don't want you flying the same

59
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:16,666
day you're performing.

60
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:17,701
>> CHERLENE: Oh, don't worry

61
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,702
about that.

62
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,703
>> MALORY: Well, but...

63
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,670
>> CHERLENE: Because Cherlene

64
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:21,705
don't fly.

65
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,706
>> MALORY: Airplane air is so

66
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,041
dry, plus you're breathing in

67
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,075
God knows what those

68
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:26,410
tuberculars in coach are...

69
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:27,644
Excuse me?!

70
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,579
>> CHERLENE: I don't fly.

71
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,314
>> MALORY: I... but-but I've

72
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:32,249
seen you fly.

73
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,316
>> CHERLENE: Well, maybe you saw

74
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,551
Cheryl fly.

75
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,652
>> LANA: In a helicopter, the

76
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:36,686
space shuttle...

77
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:37,721
>> PAM: Cyril choke-banged you

78
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,022
on a blimp?

79
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,323
Oh, come on, we were all

80
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:41,358
thinking it.

81
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,359
>> ARCHER: What, how are you all

82
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,593
so goddamn loud?

83
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:44,594
>> LANA: Could you not find

84
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,529
a punch bowl?

85
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,997
>> ARCHER: It was too heavy.

86
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,998
(loud crashing nearby)

87
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,434
(Woodhouse grunting)

88
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:53,670
(grunting and crashing

89
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,306
continues)

90
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,945
(groans)

91
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,514
>> ARCHER: And also too spilly.

92
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:05,949
Now, what's with all

93
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,017
the yelling?

94
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,085
>> MALORY: I booked Cherlene on

95
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,286
Travis County Limits, and...

96
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,287
>> ARCHER: Is that like...?

97
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,521
>> MALORY: It's comparable!

98
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,023
But it's tomorrow night and she

99
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,257
refuses to fly.

100
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,392
>> ARCHER: Wait, really?

101
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:16,526
So you've only got 24 hours

102
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,562
to drive to Texas?

103
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:19,763
>> MALORY: Well, 36 but...

104
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,964
>> ARCHER: But after we get a

105
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,365
bus and a blocker car it'll be

106
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,567
24, right?

107
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,701
>> MALORY: What?

108
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:25,735
>> LANA: Oh. Oh, God, no.

109
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:26,703
>> ARCHER: Yes!

110
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:27,637
>> LANA: Archer?

111
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,638
>> ARCHER: Lana!

112
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,706
>> MALORY: Sterling!

113
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,740
What are you talking about?

114
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,741
>> LANA: Smokey and the goddamn

115
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:32,909
Bandit.

116
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,910
>> MALORY: What?

117
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:34,911
>> ARCHER: We're going

118
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:36,413
¶ Eastbound and down!

119
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,414
>> MALORY: I will never

120
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,082
understand his idiotic

121
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,450
fascination with all this Burt

122
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,718
Reynolds Smokey trucker

123
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,986
nonsense.

124
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:43,987
>> LANA: I think part of it is

125
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,055
because you didn't get him

126
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:45,989
that CB McHaul toy truck he

127
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,491
wanted for his birthday.

128
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:48,225
>> MALORY: Wha...?

129
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:50,327
He was 30!

130
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,469
>> LANA: And words fail me.

131
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,171
I have no words.

132
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,172
>> ARCHER: How about

133
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,506
ten-goddamn-four?!

134
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,474
>> MALORY: How about how much

135
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:38,475
did this cost?

136
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:39,843
>> CHERLENE: How about a

137
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,044
Jacuzzi, bitches? Woooooo!

138
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,012
>> ARCHER: You know what they

139
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,513
say-- can't put a price on

140
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,481
free advertising.

141
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,649
>> MALORY: No, they don't, and

142
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:46,883
free this isn't.

143
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:47,884
>> ARCHER: Exactly.

144
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:48,852
How much are they

145
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,853
paying Cherlene?

146
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,820
>> MALORY: It's public

147
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:51,855
television, they don't pay

148
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,856
anything.

149
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,391
All they do is suck money in.

150
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,525
They take our taxes...

151
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,160
>> LANA: Or donations, whatever.

152
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,728
>> MALORY: Of pre-tax dollars

153

from pot-taking Bolshevik

154

lesbian couples!

155
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,033
Then PBS mixes it all in with

156
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,702
their huge N.E.A. grants,

157
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,070
launders it in inner-city

158
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,471
methadone clinics, and pumps it

159
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,540
right back out to pro-abortion,

160
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,875
super-PACs!

And, wow, maybe I

164
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,547
have aphasia.

165
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,548

166
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,516
you're going?

167
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:20,517
>> ARCHER: She's driving the

168
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,551
bus.

169
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,519
Mother, get on the bus.

170
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:23,553
Lana, you're riding with me.

171

00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:28,892
>> ARCHER: In the blocker car,

174
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,493
duh, if Cyril didn't just break

175
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,528
the stupid axle.

176
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,495
>> MALORY: The what?

177
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:33,496
>> LANA: Okay, first of all...

178
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:34,531
>> MALORY: How much did that

179
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,498
cost?

180
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,499
>> ARCHER: Well, again, it's

181
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,500
advertising, so...

182
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:38,602
>> MALORY: For what?

183
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,703
>> ARCHER: Hmm, I guess Pontiac?

184
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:40,670
>> MALORY: God.

185
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:41,671
>> ARCHER: And where are you

186
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:42,706
going?

187
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,707
>> LANA: Well, speaking

188
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,075
for the tiny, delicate life

189
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,943
blossoming inside me, nowhere in

190
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:47,911
a car with T-tops and a

191
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,912
four-barrel.

192
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,913
>> ARCHER: Wha... Who's gonna do

193
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,114
snappy dialogue with me,

194
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,415
underscored by sexual

195
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,185
attraction?

196
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,554
I'm so angry right now I can't

197
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:58,054
even...

198
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:59,089
(sniffs)

199
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,090
Oh, goddamn it!

200
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,124
Did you fart in that?

201
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,793
(Pam laughing)

202
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,533
>> LANA: Damn it, Cyril,

203
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,534
slow down!

204
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:12,535
>> MALORY: Cyril, do nothing

205
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:13,603
of the sort!

206
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,438
Because if we miss that taping,

207
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,740
I won't be responsible

208
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:17,707
for my actions.

209
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,742
>> LANA: Are you ever?

210
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:19,809
>> MALORY: She said, single and

211
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,544
pregnant.

212
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:22,579
Oh, wait.

213
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,780
>> CYRIL: Can you two please

214
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,415
go... anywhere else?

215
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,983
It's bad enough I have to drive

216
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,451
24 hours straight.

217
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,452
>> LANA: Well, Krieger said he

218
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,954
needed Ray's help on some sort

219
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,455
of project.

220
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,623
>> RAY: This quit being funny

221
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,492
two hours ago!

222
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:36,593
>> KRIEGER: It's not supposed to

223
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:37,827
be funny.

224
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,828
>> MALORY: So shut up and drive

225
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,563
the damn bus!

226
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,565
Sorry, I'm a bit stressed out

227
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,733
about Cherlene getting

228
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:44,768
a record deal.

229
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,769
>> LANA: Right, and your ten

230
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,103
percent of it.

231
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,171
>> MALORY: Or 50 or whatever.

232
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,239
>> LANA: What?

233
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,607
>> CYRIL: 50, really?

234
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:51,641
>> LANA: Who are you, Colonel

235
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,576
Mom Parker?

236
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:54,611
Nothing?

237
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:55,578
>> CYRIL: Meh.

238
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,680
>> MALORY: And not that I care

239
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:57,814
what any of you think, about

240
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,015
anything, but I lost everything

241
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,984
when the Feds took ISIS, and Ron

242
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,752
took what little I had left, so

243
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:03,853
now I need to make it back

244
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:04,954
somehow.

245
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,690
And I'm not doing that selling

246
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,825
cocaine, thanks to Sterling,

247
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,593
who, unbelievably, is even

248
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,796
worse at this than at spying.

249
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,431
>> ARCHER: Hey, so...

250
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,166
Yeah, hi, uh, I think maybe

251
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,634
somebody's holding down

252
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,035
the talk-button thingy?

253
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,503
>> CYRIL: Uh... oh!

254
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,671
Uh, sorry, Archer.

255
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,706
>> LANA: Exactly the opposite of

256
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,707
how it works.

257
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,708
>> CYRIL: What?

258
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,675
Oh.

259
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,510
Uh, sorry, Archer.

260
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,712
(Archer sighs)

261
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:29,679
>> ARCHER: Ten-ten-four, good

262
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,680
buddy.

263
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,782
>> MALORY: Sterling?

264
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:33,817
>> CYRIL: Well, he can't hear

265
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,051
you now, I... ow!

266
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,686
Ow!

267
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,155
Whose ring is that, the pope's?!

268
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,857
>> PAM (laughing): Ouch!

269
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,858
>> ARCHER: Shut up.

270
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,892
>> PAM: Seriously though, I'm

271
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,861
sorry you heard her say that.

272
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:45,895
That's got to be a real knee to

273
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,031
the old emotional nut sack.

274
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,165
>> ARCHER: Well, I guess it

275
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,167
would be, if A-- I weren't the

276
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,168
world's greatest spy.

277
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,136
>> PAM: Eh.

278
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,571
>> ARCHER: Shut up, and B-- if

279
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:55,739
they weren't sitting on a

280
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,640
hundred pounds of coke.

281
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:58,408
>> PAM: What?!

282
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,042
>> ARCHER: Affirmatory,

283
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,009
good buddy!

284
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:00,910
>> PAM: Holy dickburn!

285
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,645
So you got a buyer lined up

286
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:03,713
in Texas and everything?!

287
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,848
>> ARCHER: Well, not exactly,

288
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,050
or at all, but, Pam, come on.

289
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,818
We're talking about Texas.

290
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,220
Somebody, somewhere, wants

291
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,721
enough cocaine to forget they

292
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,555
live there.

293
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,556
>> PAM: Yeah, but not

294
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,191
>> ARCHER: Maybe we'll get

295
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,659
lucky, find an entire town

296
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,862
that wants to commit suicide.

297
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,196
>> PAM: Wonder if there's a

298
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,831
statewide database of towns

299
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,999
with sucky high school

300
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:23,833
football teams cross-indexed

301
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,101
with towns a black person just

302
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:26,002
moved to.

303
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,504
>> ARCHER: Jesus, Pam,

304
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:28,671
I was kidding.

305
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:29,839
>> PAM: (laughs) Duh, me too,

306
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,874
lickbag.

307
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,008
>> ARCHER: Well, but see if

308
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,376
there is one, just

309
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:34,611
for shits and giggles.

310
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:35,678
>> PAM: Um, so, hey,

311
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,713
speaking of...

312
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:37,747
>> ARCHER: The hat fart was

313
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,548
technically a shart?

314
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,917
(laughs)

315
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,553
How are you still single?

316
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,888
>> PAM: Right?

317
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,122
(chomps)

318
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,792
(belches)

319
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,232
>> LANA: Cyril!

320
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:56,866
(Cyril screams)

321
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,268
>> LANA: Goddamn it!

322
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,235
>> CYRIL: I'm-I'm sorry!

323
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:00,303
>> MALORY: What the hell is

324
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:01,438
going on up here?!

325
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,572
>> CYRIL: I must've dozed off!

326
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,473
>> LANA: Really?

327
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:04,774
You don't just hate signs?

328
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,109
>> CYRIL: No, Lana, I don't

329
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,076
ha... Ow!

330
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,311
>> LANA: In addition to sushi,

331
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,447
booze, and soft cheeses,

332
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,781
I'm also supposed to abstain

333
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,249
from bus crashes!

334
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,751
So stay awake!

335
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,152
>> CYRIL: I'm trying,

336
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,454
but 18 hours?

337
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,322
I don't know how Pam's doing it.

338
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,090
>> LANA: Seriously?

339
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,225
>> PAM: Woooooo!!

340
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,661
(laughs)

341
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:25,662
(Archer yells)

342
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:26,729
>> ARCHER: What the...?!

343
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:27,730
>> PAM: Hey, sleepyhead!

344
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,098
Welcome to Texas!

345
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
>> ARCHER: Already?

346
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,235
What the shit, Pam?!

347
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,470
>> PAM: That's how we do

348
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,237
backseat drivers.

349
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,505
>> ARCHER: I was driving!

350
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:36,806
>> PAM: Yeah, and sucking at it.

351
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,841
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it!

352
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,409
How long was I out?

353
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,677
>> PAM: Like, 12 hours?

354
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,645
Five states, dozen cupcakes,

355
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,080
a bunch of truck stops.

356
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,148
>> TRUCKER (over CB): Uh,

357
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,282
breaker breaker, you got your

358
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:47,517
ears on, Snowball? Come back.

359
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,418
>> PAM: Hang on.

360
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,285
>> ARCHER: Your handle is

361
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,154
Like Jerry Reed's character

362
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,255
in the <i>Smokey-verse?!</i>

363
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,523
>> PAM: Who?

364
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,791
>> ARCHER: Oh. Is it from

365
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:55,525
from the cupcake?

366
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:56,659
>> PAM: Cupcakes? Oh! (laughs)

367
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,095
Oh, no.

368
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,129
>> ARCHER: Then what's it...?

369
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:01,331
>> PAM: Truck stops...

370
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,298
are crazy awesome!

371
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,433
This is Snowball, good buddy.

372
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,434
>> TRUCKER: You might wanna

373
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:05,335
check your six, Snowball.

374
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,503
>> ARCHER: Ew, is that about

375
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,337
the shart?!

376
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,771
>> PAM: Wha...? No, lickbag!

377
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:10,139
>> ARCHER: It was a reasonable

378
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,174
assumption.

379
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,342
>> PAM: What the...?

380
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,443
>> TRUCKER: Looks like you got

381
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:14,477
a chain gang knocking

382
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,445
on your back door.

383
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,179
>> ARCHER: Bikers?

384
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,514
What the hell do they want?

385
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,715
>> CYRIL: I think they want us

386
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:19,782
to pull over.

387
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:20,717
>> MALORY: Obviously, you idiot!

388
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,684
Why?!

389
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,552
>> CHERLENE: Kidnapping!

390
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:23,653
It's a kidnapping, it's

391
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:25,188
a kidnapping to kidnap me,

392
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,556
Cherlene!

393
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:28,124
>> LANA: Why would bikers want

394
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:29,025
to kidnap you?

395
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,059
>> MALORY: Why would anyone?

396
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,160
>> CYRIL: Yeah, you're not

397
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,795
>> CHERLENE: Yet! Duh!

398
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,531
Neither was Frank Sinatra Jr.

399
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,398
Now pull over!

400
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,733
>> LANA: We are not...

401
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,167
>> CHERLENE: Hey, treebeard!

402
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,203
Take me with you!

403
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,038
You can do unspeakable things

404
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,374
to and/or on me!

405
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,074
I... (shrieks)

406
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,376
>> LANA: You are not getting

407
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,343
kidnapped just to boost

408
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:48,177
your singing career!

409
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:49,379
>> MALORY: Well, now wait a

410
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,380
a minute.

411
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,347
>> ARCHER: Wait a minute!

412
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:52,348
Did you tell anybody

413
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,683
we were hauling a shitload

414
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:54,384
of coke?!

415
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,184
>> PAM: Uh...

416
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:58,821
(phone rings)

417
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:01,491
 mm... maybe.

418
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,092
>> ARCHER: Maybe?!

419
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,227
>> PAM: Or definitely.

420
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,195
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it, Pam!

421
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:07,230
>> PAM: I wanted people

422
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,331
to like me.

423
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,499
>> ARCHER: People who like you

424
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,667
because you have cocaine aren't

425
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,535
people you want as friends, Pam.

426
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,770
And not to sound elitist,

427
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,171
but neither are people who need

428
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,439
a roll of quarters

429
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,574
to take a shower!

430
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,175
>> PAM: It's not just a shower,

431
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,610
it's more communal, like

432
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:21,711
a Japanese onsen, or...

433
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,680
>> ARCHER: Wow! I didn't think

434
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:25,248
it was possible, but I somehow

435
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,716
just got even angrier!

436
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,184
>> PAM: What the heck are you

437
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,185
looking for?

438
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:30,887
Gun-gun-gun-gun! Cyril look out!

439
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,522
>> CYRIL: No!

440
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,390
(all yelling)

441
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,525
>> CYRIL: Oh, God!

442
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:38,127
(bikers scream)

443
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,429
>> PAM: They're shooting at

444
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,530
them!

445
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,731
>> ARCHER: And I'd love nothing

446
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,232
more than to shoot back, Pam,

447
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:44,400
but somehow, I can't find

448
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,301
my gun!

449
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,370
>> MALORY: For the love of God,

450
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:48,204
just pull over!

451
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,106
>> LANA: Cyril, do not stop

452
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:50,740
this bus!

453
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:52,442
>> MALORY: Let's just give them

454
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,142
Cherlene.

455
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,277
That is the very definition

456
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,144
of a win-win!

457
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:55,612
>> CHERLENE: Yes!

458
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,579
>> LANA: No!

459
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:57,647
>> CHERLENE: Why do you always

460
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:58,615
ruin everything for me?!

461
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,816
>> LANA: Why do you always never

462
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:00,717
shut up?!

463
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,085
>> ARCHER: Because where the

464
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:03,319
hell is my gun?!

465
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,321
>> PAM: Are you, like, sure you

466
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:08,057
brought it?

467
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,559
(gunfire, both scream)

468
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,593
>> LANA: Ugh! Move!

469
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:11,394
(Cyril gasps)

470
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:12,762
>> MALORY: Oh, shut up.

471
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:13,663
>> LANA: Seriously.

472
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:16,132
(tires squeal, horns blare)

473
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:20,670
(bikers scream)

474
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,674
>> ARCHER: Where's my gun, Pam?!

475
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,342
What, did you spit it in some

476
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,744
trucker's mouth, too?!

477
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,278
>> PAM: Okay, so, apparently a

478
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,014
big thing at truck stops is a

479
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,582
game called craps.

480
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,816
And apparently I'm not good

481
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,486
at it.

482
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,354
(Pam screams)

483
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:39,756
>> CYRIL: Lana, Lana, Lana!

484
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,090
>> LANA: Thank you, Cyril,

485
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,526
I have eyeballs!

486
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:48,598
(biker screams)

487
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,333
(Lana chuckles)

488
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,201
>> LANA: Yeah, bitch, that's how

489
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:53,536
I roll! Shit!

490
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:54,771
(all scream, tires screech)

491
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:56,205
>> ARCHER: Because even a

492
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,840
goddamn baby knows, in craps,

493
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,642
you never bet on the hard ways!

494
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:00,810
Ow!

495
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,111
Oh shi...

496
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,714
>> ALL: ...it!

497
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:07,350
(both screaming)

498
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,390
>> PAM: You mad?

499
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,558
>> ARCHER: Give ya three

500
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,626
guesses, Pam.

501
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,227
>> PAM: No?

502
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,697
No?

503
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,664
No?

504
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,565
>> ARCHER: Wrong, Pam.

505
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,733
Although I bet I'm not

506
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,168
as mad as Mother's gonna be

507
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,569
when I tell her this was all

508
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,236
your fault!

509
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:28,404
>> PAM: Aw, come on, Archer,

510
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:29,205
don't do that!

511
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,040
That's not what good buddies do!

512
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,475
>> ARCHER: Okay, first of all,

513
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:34,343

00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:27,944
that's got anything to do with

685
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,478
your cocaine-only diet!

686
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,913
>> PAM: Well, it's a small

687
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,581
price to pay for beauty!

688
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,916
(gun clicking)

689
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:34,984
(gunshot)

690
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:36,085
>> ARCHER: Damn it!

691
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,253
>> PAM: Man, and here you are

692
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:38,220
without your gun.

693
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,221
That's pretty ironic, huh?

694
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,623
>> ARCHER: No, Pam, once again

695
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,791
you're confusing the word ironic

696
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,926
with "you are an idiot".

697
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,561
What's ironic is that every

698
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:46,896
other store we drive by

699
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:48,764
is a gun shop!

700
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,232
>> PAM: Oh.

701
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:51,734
Okay, so then what's satire?

702
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,135
>> ARCHER: Nobody really knows!

703
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,270
Hang on!

704
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:55,738
(tires squealing)

705
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,573
And then back up a sec.

706
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,507
You're endangering your

707
00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:59,742
life for beauty?

708
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:00,910
>> PAM: Yes, duh.

709
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,511
Look, how hot am I now?

710
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:03,980
Let me answer that for you.

711
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,081
As balls.

712
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,115
That's why everybody likes

713
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,083
me now.

714
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,117
>> ARCHER: Who, your trucker

715
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,085
buddies?!

716
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,119
They only like you because

717
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,087
you have coke, Pam.

718
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,154
>> PAM:, Well, and the

719
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,122
snowballs, but...

720
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,156
>> ARCHER: And for what it's

721
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,191
worth, we all kind of liked

722
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,492
you the way you were.

723
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,593
(gunshot)

724
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,627
>> PAM: Really?

725
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:19,628
>> ARCHER: Well, we hated you

726
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,097
less. You kind of turned

727
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,598
into a ginormous asshole.

728
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,699
>> PAM: Yeah, with ginormous big

729
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:24,800
tittays.

730
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:25,868
>> ARCHER: Oh, for...

731
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,936
Pam, who cares?

732
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,104
That's just subcutaneous

733
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,538
adipose tissue.

734
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,774
Albeit a shitload of it.

735
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:32,975
But I can't bang you if you

736
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:34,710
die from an overdose.

737
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,312
>> PAM: Aw, you want to bang me?

738
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:37,313
(gunshot)

739
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,147
>> ARCHER: Obviously!

740
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,215
I mean look at those big

741
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,216
bastards!

742
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,217
Sucks we're gonna go to prison,

743
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,218
though.

744
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,119
>> PAM: Prison?

745
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,220
But it's my first offense.

746
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,221
>> ARCHER: Well, except for

747
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:47,056
treason, but explain all that

748
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:48,057
to the Brazos County judge,

749
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,225
and maybe he'll...

750
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,493
>> PAM: Wait a minute, we're in

751
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:51,727
Travis county.

752
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:52,728
Why does their car

753
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,796
say Brazos county?

754
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:54,730
>> ARCHER: Give you

755
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:55,698
three guesses!

756
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,565
>> PAM: Crooked cops?

757
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,533
>> ARCHER: Yes!

758
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,534
>> PAM: Hang on,

759
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,568
I still got two...

760
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,803
>> ARCHER: Pam, get the coke!

761
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:01,904
>> PAM: Yeah!

762
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,239
Holy coke snacks.

763
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,573
Enable the shit out of me!

764
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:05,574
>> ARCHER: What?

765
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:06,642
Not to snort, you idiot!

766
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:07,643
>> PAM: Well, I don't want to

767
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:08,310
shoot it.

768
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:09,078
That seems like a

769
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,079
pretty slippery slope!

770
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,213
>> ARCHER: Pam, any cocaine is a

771
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,214
slippery slope!

772
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,582
It's the world's most addictive

773
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,650
drug.

774
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:15,651
>> PAM: Hang on, I heard it was

775
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:16,652
nicotine.

776
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,020
>> ARCHER: It may very well be,

777
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:18,988
Pam, but in our current

778
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,489
situation I would argue that

779
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:22,058
cocaine is more dangerous,

780
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,893
because we're about to get

781
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,194
murdered for it!

782
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:26,595
(gunshots)

783
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:27,897
(tires squealing)

784
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:28,931
>> PAM: Yeah, but not overall,

785
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:29,999
is what I'm...

786
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,167
>> ARCHER: Pam, they don't want

787
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,501
us, they just want the coke,

788
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:34,737
so throw it out!

789
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,905
>> PAM: Of the car?

790
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,006
>> ARCHER: Pam!

791
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,074
>> PAM: Jeez, okay!

792
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,575
But you're gonna owe me!

793
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,010
>> ARCHER: What could I

794
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,745
possibly owe you?!

795
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,613
>> PAM: I believe there was some

796
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:45,915
mention of bone-throwing?

797
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,249
>> ARCHER: Okay, yeah, that

798
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,718
seems like a win-win.

799
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,120
>> CHARLENE: ¶ I'm eastbound

Thank you!

805
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:02,565
Good night, Travis County!

806
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,733
There will be no encore!

807
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:05,734
Woooooo!

808
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,735

00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,106
>> MALORY: No, no, no, you don't

812
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,607
walk off after one song; you get

back out there this instant.

00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:13,976
What are you doing?

815
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,144
>> CHERLENE: Uh, it's called

816
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,145
cultivating mystique?

817
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,146

my tour bus hot tub because I

821

personify outlaw country?

Stringer Records, and I want to

827
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,925
make that little gal famous.

828
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,594
Are you her manager, Mrs...?

>> MALORY: Will you put...

833
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,832
>> TONY: It genuinely does not

834
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,833
matter.

835
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:38,934
Give me a call when y'all are

836
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,236
ready to make some gold records.

837

Yee-haw! (slaps)

838
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:42,671

839
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:43,839
Well, that went better than

840
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:44,773
expected.

841
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:45,741
>> LANA: Yeah, maybe you can use

842
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:46,675
the gold records to pay Archer

843
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,510
and Pam's bail.

844
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,577

845

you can.

847
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:50,980
need.

848

00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:52,781
>> MALORY: Sterling!

850
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:53,649
>> ARCHER: Yeah, no, everything

851
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,683
is, uh, totally fine now, and we

852
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:55,651
totally got away.

00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,652
So, all set.

00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,686
>> MALORY: Yes, but how?

855
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:58,621
The police were right

856
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:00,156
>> ARCHER: Which is right where

857
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,190
I wanted them, so I could go

858
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:02,458
old school Bandit.

859
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,792
With an inverted

860
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:04,760
triple Needham.

861
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:05,828
>> MALORY: Well, it was your own

862
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,862
fault for bringing cocaine

863
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:07,930
without asking, but I suppose

864
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,865
all's well that ends well.

865
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,800
>> PAM: Well, except for...

866
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:12,801
>> ARCHER: Pam?

867
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,770
All's well that ends well?

868
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:17,139
>> PAM: Oh, right.

869
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,641
But what about the hundred

870
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:19,642
pounds of coke you dumped

871
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:20,609
on the highway?

872
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,644
>> MALORY: What?

873
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:22,711
>> ARCHER: Pam!

874
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:23,812
>> BALLADEER: Looks like old

875
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:26,515
Snowball done it again!
