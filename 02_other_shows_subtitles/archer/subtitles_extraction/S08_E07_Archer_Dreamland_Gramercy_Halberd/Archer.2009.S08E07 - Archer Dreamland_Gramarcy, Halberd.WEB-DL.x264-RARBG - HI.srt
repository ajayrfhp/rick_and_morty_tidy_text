Well, your shock.

From the shock!

157

158
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,657
- Sickle-cell anemia?
- No.

159
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,431

I was bitten

160

by a Brazilian wandering spider.

161
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:21,684
- Ew!
- Ow!

162
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:23,712
I bet they fell out
in the house.

163
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,561
Oh, dammit!
Can you hotwire it?

164
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,633
Why're you asking me?

165
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,087
Because you know all that shit

166
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,025
about putting breakfast
in the radiator!

167
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,782
- What? Potatoes, an egg...
- For a leak.

168
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,108
That's pretty common knowledge.

169
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:35,806
No, it's not.
Also pepper.

170
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,490
- Can you hotwire it?
- No.

171
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:38,611
(Cyril:)
Nobody can.

172
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,212
Because it's English
and it's stupid,

173
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,564
with a bunch of
stupid English wires.

174
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:43,853
(Annoyed sigh)

175
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:45,790
(Annoyed sigh)

176
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,321
I don't have time for this shit!

177
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:52,876
Not if that crazy kraut was on the
level about that factor-k shit.

178
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,556
And also...
I've lost track of time!

179
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:58,618
(Crash)

180
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:01,392
What was that?
(Crash)

181
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,079
Sounds like somebody's
smashing up all your shit.

182
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,281
With a halberd.

183
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,400
(Barry:)
Woooooooo!

184
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,728
Yeah. Can't have anything nice.

185
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,111
That halberd was pretty nice.
(Crash)

186
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,743
Yeah, was.
And why are we going up?

187
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:16,712
(Grunts)

188
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:24,556
Something's not right.
(Cheryl:) I'll say.

189
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:27,486
I didn't think it was possible,
but somehow being kidnapped

190
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:29,759
is even more boring
than my mother's funeral.

191
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:32,071
I meant with Archer
and the ransom!

192
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,331
- Still, though.
- Mr. zerk.

193
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:35,564
Rgh?

194
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,564
If the wheels
end up coming off this thing,

195
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:42,214
obviously
I'll need you to... tie up

196
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,811
all the remaining loose ends.

197
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,439
(Sighs)

198
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,800
(Blows raspberry)

199
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,964
I wonder what could've
gone wrong.

200
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,917
(Grunts)

201
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,941
Son of a bitch.

202
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,839
Is the parking brake off?

203
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:10,394
Oh.
Goddammit.

204
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:12,607
- Sorry.
- Will you hurry up?

205
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,938
He's not lookin' too good!
You're lookin' real good.

206
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,691
(Groans)

207
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,361
But try that hard-on shit
with me,

208
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,089
I'll kick
your dick off your body.

209
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:22,683
Ahem. Fair enough.

210
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:24,902
(Grunting)

211
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,169
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

212
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,019
Oh, shut up,
you were gonna ditch me!

213
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,034
Yeah, and it woulda
served you right!

214
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:31,917
How?

215
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,308
Oh, don't play dumb with me!

216
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,902
That crazy robot was just
about to finger you

217
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,683
for stealing Trexler's whores!

218
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,511
- Wait, what?
- Finger who? Ow!

219
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,339
That was Archer! What the hell would
I want with a buncha Chinese broads?

220
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:48,480
(Long inhale)

221
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,096
(Long exhale)

222
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:58,002
(Sniffles)
Okay, okay.

223
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:00,968
Jeez. Knock it off!

224
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:05,414
Maybe they got us
some new diapers.

225
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,492
(Gurgles)

226
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:10,666
(Inhales, sighs)

227
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,235
Ya know?

228
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:16,166
I wasn't implying you kept them.

229
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,252
Wait, hang on, did you...

230
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,440
Are we gonna stand here
all night yanking our Goddamn...

231
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,585
- Genitals?
- Yes, where did we land on that?

232
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:27,242
- Ugh!
- Hey, my keys!

233
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:28,713
I mean...

234
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,213
Right? What are the odds?

235
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,698
Because, asshole,
if we hadn't gone upstairs

236
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,187
we wouldn't be... whatever!

237
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,669
- Shinnying.
- Exactly!

238
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,694
Exactly.
And this is the last place

239
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:43,229
- he'd ever think to look for us, so...
- (Barry:) Hey, guys!

240
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,143
Wha...?
(Gasps)

241
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:45,366
(Cackles)

242
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,916
Oh, wow!

243
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,940
(Both:) Oh, shit!

244
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,102
(Both grunt)

245
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,274
And you're sure
you can drive a stick?

246
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,711
(Imitates Groucho Marx): As
long as I can find the manual!

247
00:10:58,735 --> 00:10:59,948
(Weak laugh)

248
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:02,969
- Hospital!
- Okay, jeez, I'm going!

249
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:04,445
(Imitates Marx):
Guess I better not stall.

250
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,696
(Weak laugh)

251
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:07,013
Uh, this is a cigar.

252
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,524
Go!

253
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,407
And since Archer was kind enough

254
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,993
to leave his keys
in the ignition... get in!

255
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,516
Umm...
We'll just take my car.

256
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,575
No, actually,
you'll come with me!

257
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,704
- To where?
- What? My headquarters!

258
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,477
What, like some drag club?

259
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,141
For the...
I'm not a transvestite!

260
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,006
I'm a treasury agent!

261
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,282
(Both:) What?

262
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,148
And you two are under arrest.

263
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:32,508
(Both:) What?

264
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,039
Kidnapping,
conspiracy to commit kidnapping,

265
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,696
grand larceny... oh,
and while we're on the subject,

266
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,508
I'll go ahead
and take the ransom money.

267
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,110
Well, you say that...

268
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:44,289
Hey, whoa, whoa!

269
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,595
Well. Looks like we've got
ourselves a Mexican standoff.

270
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,047
Oh, does it now?

271
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,225
Yes.
Poovey!

272
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, right.

273
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,639
Wh...? Not at me, you idiot!
At her!

274
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:56,983
Yeah, she doesn't have
the money.

275
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,365
Oh, you have got to be kidding!

276
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,608
- Poovey, put the gun down.
- Right?

277
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:02,832
Both: Shut up.

278
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,994
Listen to me,
you testify against him,

279
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,756
the judge'll go easy on you, and
you're out in like... 20 years!

280
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,514
- What?
- I meant months!

281
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,467
Nice try, Elliot mess!

282
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,248
Now hand over the dough, Figgis.

283
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,553
(Archer and Trexler yelling)

284
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,858
- What the...?
- Whatever this is

285
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,362
we don't have time for it!

286
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,132
Excuse me!
I am effecting an arrest!

287
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:26,045
Great, while you're at it
arrest him!

288
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,326
Who?

289
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,779
(Grunts)

290
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,006
(Engine starts)

291
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:36,522
(Chuckling) If for nothing
else, that outfit.

292
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,149
(Giggling)

293
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:47,408
Now where do you think
you're going?

294
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,533
Nowhere, apparently!

295
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,288
Will you get the hell off me?
I should drive!

296
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,158
- Why should you possibly drive?
- Why should you drive?

297
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,111
Because a, it's my car,
and b, you're a woman!

298
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:00,806
Hopefully. Now move!

299
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,580
(Grunts)

300
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:05,941
Whoa!
Nice!

301
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,691
Holy shit!
Right? Actually...

302
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,386
(All exclaiming)

303
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:11,646
Um...

304
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,223
(Grunts)

305
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:14,544
(All exclaim)

306
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:18,247
(Chuckles)
Eat a dick, gort.

307
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,176
(Thud)
What the... oh, come on.

308
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,168
Oh, damn it!

309
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,996
Hey, we should go to a drive-in!

310
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,086
Whoa!

311
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,567
What?
Whoa!

312
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,179
(Laughing)

313
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:40,449
For the love of God, man,
do something!

314
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,883
(Barry laughing)
Yeah.

315
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,594
Oh, damn it!

316
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,597
Whoa!

317
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:48,986
Hang on...
(Barry:) I am!

318
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,658
Not you! Idiot.

319
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,976
Whoa! (Grunts)

320
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,207
Woooooo!!

321
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:59,207
(Barry:) Archer!

- Yeah.

00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,658
Yes, hurray,
