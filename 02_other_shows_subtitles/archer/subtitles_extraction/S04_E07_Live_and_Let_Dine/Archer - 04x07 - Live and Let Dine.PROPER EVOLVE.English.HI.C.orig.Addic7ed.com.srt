1
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:04,191
CASTEAU: Why do I seem annoyed?

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,761
Let's see... Instead of savoring
this espresso, this cigarette,

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,130
and the exactly four minutes
of free time I have today,

4
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,299
I'm talking to you cockwits.

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,300
What else?

6
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:16,248
Oh, tonight I'm doing a special seating
for a bunch of diplomats from the

7
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:18,071
State Department and Albania.

8
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:21,141
So not only do I have to create a
meal out of yogurt and a goddamn

9
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:23,510
sheep's head, apparently there's
been some vague security

10
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:27,247
threat, so my highly-trained staff...
has been infiltrated!

11
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:29,383
LANA: Sorry...
CASTEAU: By Shithead Squadron.

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,186
LANA: Just need to grab some menus, for--
the camera, why is there a camera?

13
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:35,989
CASTEAU: I assume because this restaurant
can't hold three million viewers?

14
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:36,924
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): Two-point-eight.

15
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:38,725
CASTEAU: Because it's
not promoted properly!

16
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,227
LANA: This is gonna be televised?!

17
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:41,995
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): Yeah, the
show's called Bastard Chef?

18
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,064
LANA: Mm. Scuse me.

19
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,632
CASTEAU: Thank you, giraffe-lady!

20
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,436
Anyway, those ISIS idiots are doing
security, and for some inexplicable reason

21
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:52,839
they have to do that undercover, so-
[METAL BOWL HITS FLOOR]

24
00:00:55,676 --> 00:01:05,052
WONGWONGWONG...

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:05,852
ARCHER (O.S.): Whoops.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,655
CASTEAU: That's probably
why I seem annoyed.

27
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:10,590
ARCHER: Let's go Chet, c'mon, chop chop.

28
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,093
CYRIL: You're the one who dropped
it, why do I have to clean it up?

29
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:16,796
ARCHER: Because you're the garon de
cuisine, which means kitchen boy, whereas

30
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:20,700
I am the sous chef, which means shut
your face and mop up the damn yogurt.

31
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,169
CYRIL: And why do you
get to be sous chef?

32
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:24,938
ARCHER: Because I have
fine dining experience!

33
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,239
I used to own a restaurant.

34
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,607
CYRIL: It was a burger joint!

35
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:28,241
ARCHER: Cyril?

36
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:29,609
I mean Chet?

37
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:30,610
LANA (O.S.): Archer?

38
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:31,378
ARCHER: She means Randy.

39
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:32,479
LANA: Can I borrow you?

40
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,681
ARCHER: Sure, Mitzi.

41
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:36,483
LANA: My name is not Mitzi.

42
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,050
Walk-in.

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:37,851
Now.

44
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:39,586
ARCHER: Yeah, I got time for a quickie.

45
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:40,620
CYRIL: Wait, a what?

46
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:41,888
Arch -- Randy!

47
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,391
Whoaaa, whoaaa... ungh!

48
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,192
(sighs)

49
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,926
You guys can edit that out, right?

50
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:47,760
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): Yes.

51
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,729
But we won't.

52
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:53,766
LANA: So, quick question, do you think
it's a good idea to be talking to a

53
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:54,468
TV crew when we're undercover?

54
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,938
ARCHER: Fake names, duh, follow-up question,
do you know how TV actually works?

55
00:01:59,007 --> 00:01:59,725
LANA: I --

56
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,845
ARCHER: They're not gonna broadcast
this episode in this restaurant tonight!

57
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:03,643
Wait, are you guys?

58
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,279
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): No, we --
ARCHER: Like a closed-circuit deal, or...?

59
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,047
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): No.

60
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:10,283
ARCHER: Because come to think of it, I
don't know how TV actually works either.

61
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,472
LANA: How about geopolitics?

62
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,021
ARCHER: Eh...
LANA: Because if anything goes wrong tonight,

63
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,690
US-Albanian relations could
become even more unstable, so --

64
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:18,691
CASTEAU (O.S.): What the shit?!

65
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,428
ARCHER: Speaking of unstable --
that guy is a powder keg.

66
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:26,033
CASTEAU: Why is there yogurt frickin'
soup all over my spotless frickin' kitchen?!

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,566
CYRIL: Randy did it.

68
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:31,104
ARCHER: Whoa whoa, first of all, no I didn't,
and second, these bowls are the worst!

69
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,083
ARCHER: Look, they're
like, totally slipper--

Seize, please hold.

CASTEAU: What're you doing?

77
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:30,337
LANA: Well I'll tell you what I'm not doing --
CASTEAU: Besides your job?

78
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:33,307
LANA: My job, is --
CASTEAU: Answering the damn phone.

79
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:37,043
A task so simple that if the health department
should let me, I'd have a monkey do it.

80
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:37,611
LANA: Why?

81
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,012
CASTEAU: No, I was
obviously being facetious.

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,714
I would never allow a
monkey in my restaurant.

83
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:43,517
Except maybe in the form of an
exquisitely prepared entre.

84
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,554
LANA: No, I mean you're booked solid for...
Holy shit, the next ten months?

85
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:49,390
So why even bother answering the phone?

86
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:50,991
CASTEAU: To tell people
they can't eat here.

87
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,859
LANA: So, to drive
people away, basically.

88
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:53,960
CASTEAU: Those people.

89
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,062
That's not even the real phone
number for reservations.

90
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,830
LANA: I'm sorry?

91
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,098
CASTEAU: The real number's a secret.

92
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,334
Closely guarded by people
I deem acceptable.

93
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:03,937
LANA: So, just so I'm clear, instead
of assessing the security needs for

94
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,740
tonight, I'm answering phone calls
from people who aren't good enough

95
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,275
to eat here in the first place.

96
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:12,979
CASTEAU: Yeah, so try to sound
apologetic, but not, ya know, overly so.

97
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:13,647
LANA: Seize.

98
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,550
I'm sorry, we have nothing
available for the next ten months.

99
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:18,852
Mmmkaybye.

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,053
CASTEAU: Keep trying.

101
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,488
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Ugh, why?

102
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:22,956
MALORY: Besides I said so?

103
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:24,057
CHERYL/CAROL: They're booked.

104
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,926
MALORY: If I'd known I couldn't
get a table I'd have never

105
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,828
agreed to do security!

106
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,496
PAM: Why do they need security anyway?

107
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:33,600
MALORY: There was a... threat, of
some sort, it's all rather vague,

108
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:36,437
but when those State
Department dweebs see just

109
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:42,242
how good ISIS really is, mark my words...
one day soon we'll be a major player.

110
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,776
CHERYL/CAROL & PAM:

[suppressed chuckling]

112
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:44,745
MALORY: What.

113
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:47,548
CHERYL/CAROL: No, you know, just...
PAM (still chuckling): You say

114
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,616
that like you believe it.

115
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:50,551
Wh-? Hey!

116
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:51,652
MALORY: Get me a table.

117
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,492
Or the fish gets it.

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,793
PAM: [huge, explosive sob]

119
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,894
CHERYL/CAROL: Jesus, what's the big deal?

120
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:06,667
PAM: That's my fish,
his name's Jermaaaine!

121
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:07,634
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.

122
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,169
I thought he was just your food.

123
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:10,303
CASTEAU (O.S.): Food?!

124
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:12,439
We're not making food, people!

125
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:13,841
We are creating cuisine!

126
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:15,709
Food is what a dog eats!

127
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,710
Or a tourist!

128
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,512
ARCHER: Wait, a dog ate a tourist?

129
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,112
What!

130
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,081
That was ambiguously worded!

131
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:22,048
CYRIL: Gnfgh!

132
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,417
CASTEAU: Was that ambiguous?!

133
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:24,284
CYRIL: Why?

134
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,986
Are you antagonizing him?

135
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:29,556
ARCHER: Cyril, c'mon,
it's my nature. See?

136
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:30,891
Yeah, kinda!

137
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,992
CASTEAU (O.S.): Well how about this?!

138
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:32,726
CYRIL: Gnfgh!

139
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:35,195
ARCHER: Plus he can't aim for shit,
he's pulling everything to the right.

140
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,831
CASTEAU: And if you can't turn that
into promo gold, you should honestly

141
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,165
consider suicide.

142
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,567
Hang on, there's a bumper.

143
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:42,235
Now prep, you [BEEEEEP] maggots!

144
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,971
And then bleep out [BEEEEEP], since
Darlene won't let me say that.

145
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,908
But seriously guys, we do have
a lot of food to prep, so...

146
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:51,612
ARCHER: Uh, the food's spalttered
all over the wall and floor and...

147
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,381
Chet here, so --
CASTEAU: So scoop it into a bowl.

148
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,951
Nobody'll know, it's Albanian glop,
the entre's a frickin sheep face.

149
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,021
I value all cultures equally highly.

150
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,989
GILLETTE: Should you be smoking in here?

151
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,758
CASTEAU: Should you be flaming in here?

152
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:07,428
GILLETTE: Ya know...
CASTEAU: Boom! Bumper!

153
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:10,063
GILLETTE (about to cry):
He's just such a... bastard!

154
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,031
Wh-?

155
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,599
And that's not my name!

156
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:13,734
ARCHER: Yeah, "Child-Murderer"

157
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:18,338
shouldn't be hyphenated, that makes it
seem like he's a murderer who's also a child.

158
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:21,107
INTERVIEWER (O.S.): Actually no, it doesn't --
ARCHER: Actually yes, it does.

159
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:25,178
"Publicity whore" isn't hyphenated, so why--
CASTEAU: Why the shit?!

160
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:25,813
Are you maggots!

161
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
Not prepping?!

162
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:29,483
ARCHER: I -- wait, are
you doing a bumper?

163
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,720
SEXY ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Coming up, on Bastard Chef!

164
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:35,055
CYRIL: Aaaaaagh!

165
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:37,223
GILLETTE: Aaaaaaagh!

166
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,259
ARCHER: I have seriously
never been happier.

167
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,462
Aaaaaagh!

168
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,229
ARCHER (O.S.): Boom, bumper.

169
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,688
LANA (O.S.): Wait, so
what'd Malory say exactly?

170
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:55,257
ARCHER: I -- she said "credible threat."

171
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,193
LANA: I know, but what kind of credible --
ARCHER: Cyr -- Chet!

172
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,261
I need those onions!

173
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,696
CYRIL (O.S.): Yes, chef!

174
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:01,096
ARCHER: Ha!

175
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,264
He has to call me chef.

176
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,767
LANA: How and why are you enjoying this?

177
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:08,303
ARCHER: Well for one
thing I'm pretty drunk.

178
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,440
And besides bartending in Polynesia,
I've never had a real job, so --

179
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,608
LANA: Wait, never?

180
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:16,712
ARCHER: Uh... oh, when I was ten I
asked if I could sell "Grit" door to

181
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,181
door, so I could win some
of those x-ray specs?

182
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,716
But Mother said they were fake.

183
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,485
And also that I'd get raped and murdered.

184
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,787
LANA: It is like peeling
an onion with you.

185
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:25,721
ARCHER: Right?

186
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:26,289
Oh wait.

187
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:26,856
Chet!

188
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,858
Onions!

189
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:29,759
CYRIL: Here.

190
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,195
What dish are they going in?

191
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:34,463
CYRIL: Oh eat a dick!

192
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:36,365
ARCHER: That's eat a dick, chef!

193
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,402
And for a third thing, I think I
actually might be good at this.

194
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:41,069
CASTEAU: Okay, yeah,
nice technique, Randy.

195
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,170
ARCHER: Thank you, chef.

196
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,606
Want me to prep the 'shrooms?

197
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,307
CASTEAU: No I got these,
you do the aubergines.

198
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,041
ARCHER: Right away, chef.

199
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:50,979
If Chet gets his incompetent thumb
out of his equally incompetent ass!

200
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,883
CASTEAU: Nice, yes, that
is excellent A.B.B.A.B.

201
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,150
ARCHER: Always Be
Berating And Belittling.

202
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:55,818
CASTEAU: And you.

203
00:07:55,886 --> 00:08:02,024
Time to lean, time to get your
distracting tits off my line.

204
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,325
ARCHER: Hey, is something burning?

205
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:06,061
Oh wait, it's you, because
you just got burned.

206
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,731
LANA: I -- oh my God,
you admire that dick.

207
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,120
ARCHER: He's a master chef, Lana.

208
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,569
Which turns out is not nearly as
gay a job as I thought it was.

209
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:16,204
I mean it's no secret agent,
but it's way above architect.

210
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:19,608
LANA: Speaking, of secret agent, at some
point before the restaurant is full

211
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:22,945
of diplomats, I'd love to go over the--
ARCHER: Menu, I know, let's --

212
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,079
LANA: Plan!

213
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,481
ARCHER: On going over the menu, yes.

214
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:29,017
Get child murderer Gilles de Rais in
here and I'll walk you through it.

215
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:31,219
CASTEAU (O.S.): Answer the
goddamn phone, woman!

216
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:32,988
ARCHER: Seriously,
Mitzi, how hard is that?

217
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,590
CHERYL/CAROL: Rrgh!

Now nobody's picking up!

219
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:38,226
A monkey could do this stupid job!

220

MALORY (O.S.): And yet
I pay you to do it.

221

CHERYL/CAROL: Oh, so now I'm a monkey?!

224

LANA: What is this, Spain?

225
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:53,825
CHERYL/CAROL: I mean, it is
just constant A.B.B.A.B.

226
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:56,912
Is that supposed to funny?

227
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,613
PAM: Yes.

228
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:00,816
And also I think you might
have low blood sugar.

229
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:04,119
PAM: And I need you to focus, so we
can get Cruella de Vil's mom in there

230
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,489

CHERYL/CAROL: It's immpoossiibllle.

232
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,826
And what's so important
about a stupid goldfish?

233
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:14,630
PAM: Okay A, he's not a goldfish, and B--
CHERYL/CAROL: Please don't berate me.

Tell 'em Thuy!

Tonight has to go perfectly, because
it is wall to wall VIP's out there.

342
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,998
We've got the Albanian ambassador and
all his little diplomat buddies...

343
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,668
CASTEAU (O.S.): And also Little Vernie Kennedy,
JFK's crazy niece or cousin or something.

344
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,503
CHERYL/CAROL: (posh accent, laughing)

345
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:27,543
And then Teddy walks into the library
wearing nothing but a whiskey sour!

Oh, Teddy.

00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,412
Such a scamp.

CASTEAU: So no screw ups!

00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,214
Now get to work!

351
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:34,683
Talking to you, Gayvid Niven!

00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,518
GILLETTE: Oh, eat a di --
CASTEAU: What was that?

353
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:37,452
GILLETTE: Yes, chef!

354
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,820
CASTEAU: Randy, ready the soup.

355
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:41,823
I'll be out front, favoring the
guest of honor with an aperitif

356
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,258
and my presence.

357
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:46,294
GILLETTE: And here you are, Mr. Ambassador...
ALBANIAN AMBASSADOR: I prefer to

358
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:48,096
be called Your Excellency.

359
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,531
GILLETTE: Well, people
in hell want ice water.

360
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,866
LANA: (whisper) Ray!

361
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:52,400
LANA: What is your problem?!

362
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,571
GILLETTE: Besides not knowing if I
should add an eighteen percent gratuity?

363
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:58,907
Because I can, it's a party of six
or more, but if they were gonna tip

364
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:01,276
twenty percent, I just hosed myself.

365
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:03,411
LANA: Not to mention
US-Albanian relations.

366
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,682
So instead of insulting the ambassador,
whom we're here to protect --

367
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:07,950
GILLETTE: Protect him from what?

368
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:11,723
The only threat around here is --
MALORY: Dying of thirst, apparently.

369
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:15,045
I've been trying to get a table at
Seize for months and when I finally

370
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:20,417
do, instead of Casteau's world-famous
risotto, I have to eat sheep face --

371
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,365
LANA: Wait a minute...

372
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,793
MALORY: -- so for God's sake,
the least you can do

373
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:24,554
is keep my wine glass full!

374
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,223
LANA: Oh my God, it's you!

375
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,691
You're the threat!

376
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:30,318
You couldn't get a table so made
an anonymous threat and then got

377
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,595
ISIS hired to do security!

378
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,232
MALORY: Well that's still
no excuse for poor service.

379
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,433
GILLETTE: Wow.

380
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,467
LANA: Okay, you know what?

381
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:38,768
Excuse me!

382
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,404
MALORY: Yes, tell them all about it.
That'll do wonders

383
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:44,100
for US-Albanian relations.

384
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,144
LANA: <i>Bon appetit!</i>
