00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,884
[Groans] [Raspy voice] Oh, good.
You're making tea.

162
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,053
'Cause I could use some
with honey and lemon.

163
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:51,155
[Coughs]
And bourbon.

164
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:54,125
But actually,
without the honey and lemon

165
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,259
and the tea.

166
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,961
So just bourbon.

167
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,997
Yeah, I doubt if--
[Coughs] [Groans]

168
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,833
[Normal voice] Oh, shut up. Don't ruin it.
I had something for--

169
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,801
Puke Skywalker? Mm.

170
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,069
God damn it!

171
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,805
Anyway, I doubt the robot
has any bourbon,

172
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:12,143
and I'm not really in the mood
for a WD-40 and coke.

173
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,348
Unless that is, literally,
the only thing to drink.

174
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,849
I think I might be concussed.

175
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,837
Hell hath no fury, huh?
Meaning?

176
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,087
As a woman scorned.
Lana, remember?

177
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,156
I kinda scorned you
last time we met?

178
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:28,025
[Chuckling] Yeah, you are
definitely concussed.

179
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,894
Not to mention a decepticon!

180
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:31,862
Where the hell
did you get a bionic hand?

181
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,897
Uh...

182
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:34,832
[Whirring]
So...

183
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,324
what's new?
How you been?

184
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,382
Sharper image?
Uh-huh.

185
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,867
Sounds more like Krieger.

Will he not rest

187
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:44,581
until we've all been
enslaved by Skynet?

188
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,683
Hey, we are leaving
in five, so--

189
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,553
Right after I enjoy this
<i>mate </i> and <i> caña </i> smoothie

190
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,556
with a WD-40 float.

191
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:53,824
[Coughs]

192
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,526
Although "enjoy" is maybe
a bit strong.

193
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,628
Ugh. Conway,
grab whatever you need,

194
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,497
presumably
some fresh nine-volts,

195
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,832
and let's get
this extraction going.

196
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,733
I can't.
I don't have the intel yet.

197
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,802
What intel?
Slater said, "extraction."

198
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,538
When he asked us
to come rescue you.

199
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,507
From what?
Your mom's antique vagina?

200
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:11,608
You son of a--
[Growls]

201
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,478
Hey! Enough, you two!

202
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,480
[Both] Tell him that!
Pretty sure I just did.

203
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,882
Now, what and where
is this "intel"?

204
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,551
It's a computer file
with the real identity

205
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,487
of every single CIA agent

206
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,455
operating in central
and South America.

207
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:26,845
Argentina's using it
for leverage,

208
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,692
threatening to trade it
to the Soviets.

209
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,827
Wait.
Isn't Argentina our ally?

210
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:33,463
You'd think, right? After we
threw them that lovely coup?

211
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,765
So, the file is on
the mainframe computer

212
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,734
of the Argentine
secret intelligence service.

213
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:40,737
Okay. Here's what we do--
How about maybe let him finish?

214
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:43,607
Hmm. Okay. But then
we go with my plan.

215
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:46,510
The mainframe is a standalone
in a secure vault.

216
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:48,745
Hardened, keycard,
and retinal scan entry.

217
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:51,448
On the top floor of the
intelligence building itself,

218
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:52,782
which is heavily guarded
at all times,

219
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,418
by Argentine special ops
on standing orders

220
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:59,723
to shoot to kill any and all
unauthorized personnel.

221
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,658
You mentioned something
about a plan?

222
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:05,829
[Sighs] I mean, he obviously
thinks he has a plan, so whatever.

223
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:07,497
Let's hear it.

224
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,499

Where is it?
Where's what?

228
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,840
What are you--
I flushed it!

229
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,876
[Gasps] I will kill you!
[Choking]

230
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,578
Where you stand!

231
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:22,913
[Choked scream]
[Woman] Hey!

232
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,815
Is it too much to ask,
during the goddamn work day,

233
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:29,486
for two separate sessions
of 80 uninterrupted minutes each

234
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:30,887
of quality dump time?

235
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:33,490
[Gasping] I mean, I'm
not a labor attorney.

236
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,492
Yes, it is entirely
too much to ask!

237
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,826
I thought so, yeah.

238
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,629
So I'll pass that on
to who or whomever asked.

239
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,765
And if you harmed
one single hair

240
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,767
on her little brown head,
I will--

241
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:44,835
Whose head?
Wait, do what?

242
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,469
Baby A.J.!

243
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,604
She's missing!
[Both gasp]

244
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:48,872
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God!

245
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,574
And since you are

who hates babies--

247
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,644

Just baby people.

248
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:55,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! [Gasping]

249
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,648
I'm sure-- wait.
Did you murder the baby?

250
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:01,851
Uh-uh.
No, but like "swearsie-realsies"?

251
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
[Strained voice]
Swearsie-realsies.

252
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:06,690
And that's pretty sacred
to us, so...

253
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,558
[Gasping, coughing]

254
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,560
we'll go help you
look for baby A.J.

255
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,930
[High-pitched fart] In, like,
five-teen, 40 minutes.

256
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,566
And so Conway's plan

257
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,902
doesn't strike you
as unnecessarily complicated?

258
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,737
[Archer]
No, Lana, it doesn't.

259
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,505
And it doesn't strike you

260

as "Brazilian minstrel show
meets <i> Trading Places"?</i>

No, Lana, it doesn't.

262
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,645
And that's not just because

263

No, Lana, it-- look.

we're all gonna
be murdered, so...

267
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,920

Or you!

Agh! Well,
you could have said that!

I did.
I thought you were being sarcastic!

But--
and the implied threat here

is that I will shoot you

over there

00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,695
could pass for a Latino
to get us in.

Yeah, vaguely,
but if it's revenge you want,

why don't you shoot me?

00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:22,917
That is my real name!

479
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:26,087
[Southern accent] Maw, they
got ol' Lando this time.

480
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:29,057
[Coughs] I'm done for.

481
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,659
Archer, shut up.
You're gonna be okay.

482
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,027
You really think so?
[Vehicle approaching]

483
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,630
I mean, maybe.

484
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,831
[Tires screeching]

485
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,966
Although that can't bode well.

486
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,801
You get the disk?

487
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,970
Slater?
Did you get the disk?

488
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,072
Yes, idiot.
[Coughs]

489
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,074
And, also,
several bullets, so--

490
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,842
Then come on, get in the back.

491
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,677
I got a plane waiting
at an airstrip.

492
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:55,950
So, hey,
about this blowjob--

493
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,052
Shut up!
Conway was a traitor.

494
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,622
He was gonna sell the disk
to the Soviets.

495
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,890
Yeah, yeah.
We kinda suspected that.

496
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,609
"Kinda"?
So you sent us into a--

497
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,928
Wait. So you followed us
down here?

498
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:09,831
Come on. We're not gonna put
a couple of untested rookies

499
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,965
in the starting line-up
of game seven...

500
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,700
[Muffled]
...of the world--

501
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,736
Seriously,
okay, as I was saying--

502
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:17,038
God damn it, Archer!
I am not giving you a blowjob!

503
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,842
Not that. A.J.
If something happens to us.

504
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,812
I really don't think that this
is the time to talk about that.

505
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,680
When then?
[Coughs]

506
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,682
Why don't you want
to talk about it, Lana?

507
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,917
[Sighs]

508
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,886
Because I'm afraid
it'll hurt your feelings.

509
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:33,896
Because, if anything
happens to me, and--

510
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,991
just me, Archer--

511
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:38,793
then A.J. would live
with my parents.

512
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,061
Oh.

513
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,897
Yeah. Uh, I-I-I guess
that makes sense.

514
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,768
[Coughs]

515
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:47,425
They're probably
pretty old, though, right?

516
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,144
And if anything
happened to them,

517
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,674
then A.J. would live
with my sister.

518
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:55,553
You have a sister?
[Groans]

519
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,646
Yes, Archer, I have a sister.

520
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,884
She younger?

521
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,720
[Screams]

522
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:16,693
