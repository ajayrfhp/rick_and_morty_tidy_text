1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:02,901
Before we begin,

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,704
I want to make one thing
perfectly clear to all of you.

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,207
The information you're about
to hear is top secret.

4
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,143
Unauthorized publication
or "leaking"
of this information

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,711
Would be an act
of high treason,

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,279
For which you would be
tried and convicted

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,216
By a secret military tribunal
and summarily executed.

8
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,884
So no,
miss poovey,

9
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,953
I don't think a selfie
would be appropriate.

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:23,188
Okay I'm not. Jesus.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,557
Why is she even
in this briefing?

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,192
She's not allowed
to go on missions.

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,228
Because she always
stows away somehow,

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,230
As do figgis
and dr. Krieger,

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,799
And julia gluey-dreyfus
over there.

16
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,667
So this time
they're going on the mission,

17
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,902
So we can contain them.

18
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,904
Well, unless the mission
is a softball game

19
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,707
Against
gary's olde town tavern--
no, it's--

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,242
In which case
I nominate ray pitcher.

21
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,577
You know what?
Not because it's black.

22
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,214
You know what?
Lana, he's the one ashamed
of his hand's heritage, not me.

23
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,251
I'm not ashamed.
[crying]

24
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,086
[cheryl/carol]
psst, hey.

25
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,155
C-c-call me.

26
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,223
Ooh, a little
"handingo" action.

27
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,591
[holly]
ahem.

28
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,593
Time is a bit
of a factor here,

29
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,896
So as much as I'd like to spend
the day murdering all of you,

30
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,097
I'm afraid
we need to press on.

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,033
To wit,
this is dr. Zoltan kovacs.

32
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,768
Last night
in paris, someone--

33
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,237
We suspect the russians--
attempted to abduct him.

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,673
A high-speed chase
ended in a crash,

35
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,108
Which left him
in a coma

36
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,743
With a blood clot
in his brain.

37
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,578
Which matters because?

38
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,747
Because since defecting
to the west 20 years ago,

39
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,750
Dr. Kovacs has been
developing a top-secret process

40
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,351
For molecular miniaturization.

41
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,087
[chuckles]
aren't they already
pretty small?

42
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,722
It doesn't
miniaturize molecules.

43
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,591
The process can
miniaturize anything

44
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,059
Down to sub-microscopic size--

45
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,929
Robotics, computers,
video cameras, vehicles,

46
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,197
Even human beings.

47
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,099
But--
[krieger]
you maniacs!

48
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,102
You stole it!
You stole my idea!

49
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,703
[overlapping responses]

50
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,072
I've been working
on miniaturization for years,

51
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,273
Damn you, years!

52
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,576
Krieger,
those were shrinky dinks.

53
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,245
[sobbing]
it's the same principle!
[sighs]

54
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,948
It is absolutely not
the same principle.

55
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,750
Well [sniffs]
then I've wasted my life.

56
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,586
And all
of my good markers.

57
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,623
But how does it work,
this... Process?

58
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,258
You'll be given
a cursory explanation

59
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,094
At the cia laboratory
in new mexico.
Why?

60
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,996
Well, I assume they needed
a large building

61
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,232
In a remote location
with plenty of parking,

62
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,601
And real estate is a lot
cheaper out in the desert.

63
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,836
No, not why is the lab
in new mexico.

64
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,104
Why are you
going to tell us

65
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,607
How this super
top-secret shrink ray works?

66
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,343
Because
in less than 14 hours,

67
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,145
You're all going
to be miniaturized

68
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:30,682
Down to the size of bacteria
and injected into dr. Kovacs.

69
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,751
[overlapping response]

70
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,320
What if we don't consent
to be dr. Shrinkered?

71
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,189
Well there's a carrot
and a stick here,

72
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,591
The carrot being
an one-time payment

73
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,959
Of $1,000,000 each.

74
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,628
[overlapping agreements]

75
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,929
And the stick?

76
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,266
The stick is this
is your last chance.

77
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,967
You people have
bungled every assignment

78
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,271
The cia has given you, so if you
refuse or fail this mission,

79
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,806
I will personally ensure
that none of you

80
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,176
Ever works
in espionage again.

81
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,610
[overlapping disagreement]
I'm just an assistant.

No likey.

83
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,647
Well it's normally
the other way around,

84
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,615
But this time,
I think I definitely

85
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,150
Prefer the carrot.

86
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,719
Not dick,
pam, stick.

87
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,555
Carrot and stick.

88
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,956

okay people, listen up.

92
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,106
We've got an enormous amount
of information to cover

93
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,541
In a very short time
in which to do it,

So your undivided attention
is of the utmost--

Mr. Figgis,
may I help you?

Yeah, is there any reason
why you can't

00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:12,217
Just do regular brain surgery
without a shrink ray?

Yes, there is.

And, mr. Archer,
may I help you?

100

107
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,638

Let's get

132
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,524
First we need
to cover some basics.

133
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,426
Now as you may
or may not know,

00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,594
Dr. Kovacs and I
are lovers.

If that is shocking to you,
so be it.

[overlapping support]
that's not

Home to the greatest mind

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,673
This is the blood clot
that threatens

141
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,342
To destroy that brain.

142
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,511
But we will destroy the clot
with the nereus.

143
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,513
Dibs on captain.
Dibs on driving.

When this is over,

151
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,561
I really think you and I
should have a nice, long talk.

152
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,329
I'm sorry.
Am I forgetting my place?

00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,997
Little bit.

154
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,467

[scoffs]
yes, mr. Archer?

00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,671
Yeah, I think I should
at least be co-captain.

So what? So did I.
So did most of us.

159
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,510
Yeah,
but you sucked at it.

160
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,645
You kept puking
your guts out on the--
[retches]

161
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,013
The--
don't say it.

162
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,149
[chuckling]
the vomit comet.

163
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,752
But I kicked total ass
in zero gravity,

164
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,353
So I think
I should be in charge.

165
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,721
What the hell
are you talking about?

166
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,023
I know how to do it--
be weightless.

167
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,026
So?
So when we're floating around
in this kovacs guy,

168
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,328
In the submarine--

169
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,196
Have you ever seen
a submarine movie?

170
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,099
[chuckles] oh my god,
<i>operation petticoat,</i>

171
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,001
<i>Das boot,</i>
<i>the enemy below,</i>

<i>gray lady down--</i>

173
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,373
Ooh,  <i>yellow sub--</i>
<i>yellow submarine, </i> yes!

174
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,709
Wow, there's so many
submarine movies.

175
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,612
And in any of them
was anyone on board

176
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,281
Any submarine weightless?

177
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,417
[overlapping dawning]
...Fat joke?

178
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,719
Yeah, plus that time
we were all on a submarine

179
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,587
And were not weightless?

180
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,191
Oh, right. Uh, but this time
we're gonna be tiny.

181
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,359
[dr. Sklodowska]
ahem.

182
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,561
After being miniaturized,
the nereus,

183
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,062
With the mission team
on board,

184
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,565
Will be injected
into dr. Kovacs here,

185
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,700
As close to the blood clot
as possible.

186
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,970
This is because we only
have exactly 60 minutes

187
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,040
Before the process wears off
and we revert to normal size.

188
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,608
Sixty minutes exactly?

189
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,610
Yes, I feel like
I was very clear on that.

190
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,712
Our progress will be
tracked in real time

191
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,648
On a 3-d map
of the human body--
ta-da!

[overlapping disgust]

00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,717
Oh my god,
slim goodbody.

194
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,253
No!
No, this is absolutely not

195
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,655
That trademark character.

196
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,458
This is--
michael?
[scoffs] oh my god.

197
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,595
Just a unitard with the systems
of the human body on it.

198
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,431
On a guy.
On a guy named
tv's michael gray.

199
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,999
What?
[clamoring]

200
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,501
Earballs! Jesus!

201
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,770
I see I have some
fans in the audience.

202
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,072
[chuckles]
are you kidding?
Are you?

203
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,107
Lana,
it's tv's michael gray.

204
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,610
Billy batson,
from  <i>the shazam/isis hour?</i>

205
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,412
Well,
and  <i>the brian keith show.</i>

206
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,981
Obviously
in     <i>the brian keith show.</i>

207
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,017
Who is brian keith?
Now you're just
trying to piss me off.

208
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,153
So what's up?
W-what have you been doing?

209
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,322
As you see,
my good sir.

210
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,491
Cia puppet shows?

211
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,160
Act-ting,
you philistine.

212
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,029
Michael, what
are you doing here?
I--

213
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,098
How did he
even get on the base?

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,166
He said he knew you.

215
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,001
You let
an unauthorized civilian

216
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,004
Onto a cia black site
just because he said he knew me?

217
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,440
Well plus,
he is tv's michael gray.

218
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,775
[chuckles]
and as you may or may not know,

219
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,644
Tv's michael gray
and I were lovers.

220
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,513
If that is shocking to you,
so be it.

221
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,147
[overlapping disagreement]
I get it.

222
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,983
I think maybe
you're confusing

223
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,151
The word,
"shocking" with the word--
this!

224
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,021
This is shocking!
No, that's just gross.

225
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,123
Which is also the word
I think you're looking for

226
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,191
With your old man fetish.

227
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,159
Aw come on,
they're not so--

228
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,328
That one
doesn't even have skin!
[dr. Sklodowska sighs]

229
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,498
Okay if everyone will follow me
to the miniaturization chamber,

230
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,166
We will now begin
boarding the nereus.

231
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,002
Whoa. Wait. Already?

232
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,737
Yeah. Shouldn't we learn
a little more about

233
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,038
The mission parameters?

234
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,573
Oh you
absolutely should!

235
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,341
But we're behind schedule,
thanks to--

236
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,511
Tv's michael gray.
[archer]
whoo!

237
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:11,016
And...
Scene!
Yes. We get it, michael.

238
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:15,253
Scene!
No, you ruined it.

[slater]
okay people, you heard the lady.

241
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,866
We've got no time to lose,
so here are
your mission assignments.

242
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,434
Archer--
[archer]
captain!

243
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,336
No you're not.
Gillette is the pilot,

244
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,771
And cyril is the co-pilot.

245
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,372
Well we'll see about that.

246
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,674
Go see about that.

247
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,442
Okay. Pam and crazy glue,

248
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,444
Your job is to stay out
of everybody's way,

249
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,413
So maybe go do that
in the rear.

250
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,914
[scoffs]
what, like, butt-sex?

251
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,051
Of the ship.
Well let's keep
an open mind.

252
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,686
And a closed mouth.
How about that?

253
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,788
Mmm.
Just go.

254
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,557
Okay. Lana, you think
you can help dr. Sklodowska

255
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,627
With the navigation?
Well I did get an a
in college biology.

256
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,430
Oh wow, great.
So when we're traversing

257
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,732
The occipital lobe,
you'll know what to do

258
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,400
If the ship
is in imminent danger

259
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,738
Of phagocytosis
by polymorphonuclear leukocytes?

260
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,607
It actually
might've been an a-minus.

261
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,442
[groans]

262
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,477
[slater]
okay maybe just help
archer with the laser

263
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,446
If he ever gets-- out here.
[archer]
ow!

264
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,947
You two head up
to the laser turret

265
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,449
And get acquainted with
that bad boy.

[krieger]
speaking of h,

269
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,787
Do you see me
in a sort of

270
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,624
Leonard h.
"bones" mccoy type role, or--

271
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,059
[slater] meaning?
Irascible
on-board medical officer.

272
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,762
Mm yeah,
I wouldn't say on-board.

273
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,464
Oh man!

274
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,733
So not only am I not
going to tiny town,

275
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,635
Now I have
to execute a guy?

276
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,769
What are you
talking about?

277
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,304
This big, meaty bastard
right here.

278
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,839
What are we doing,
lethal injection?

279
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,308
Are you--
this is dr. Kovacs.

280
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,343
This is?
Are you sure?

281
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,279
Yes.
Because even
a first-year phrenology student

282
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,748
Could see that
this man...

283
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,518
Is a cold-blooded murderer.

284
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,354
Phrenology?
Who are you, george combe?

285
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,023
[scoffs]
man, I wish.

286
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,692
[archer]
because now I probably
have nerve damage.

287
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,629
I've decided
to let ray drive.

288
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,766
With his racist
robot monster hand!

289
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,536
Hand, legs, feet.
I am a monster.

290
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,806
Oh now, come on.
You're not a monster,

291
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,007
You're just different.

292
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,609
Come on.
It could be a lot worse.

293
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,511
How?
Well I guess the hand,

294
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,480
Or the tissue
covering the bionic part,
it would be, I guess.

295
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,482
You know, could've come
from a serial killer.

296
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,285
And then one day soon,
maybe you're shaving,

297
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,854
And you find out
it has a mind of its own.

298
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:34,793
It's a force of pure evil,
and it starts dragging you out
into the city at night.

299
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,862
Just cats at first.
But once the hand
gets a taste for killing,

300
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,964
It's only a matter of time
before you're out there

301
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,801
Strangling male prostitutes,
and then posing them

302
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,304
In grotesque and horrific
parodies of mentos ads.

303
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,807
You know,
the freshmaker.

304
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,644
In which case,
I guess try to remember

305
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,479
I was always kind to you.

306
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,916
Not always.
[nervous chuckle]

307

<i>Miniaturization will begin</i>
<i>in 30 minutes.</i>

308
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,421
And besides,
I don't think ray's hand

309
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,723

Lana,
what's more important

316
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,768
Than blasting
imaginary womp rats

317
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,869
In my imaginary

318
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,004

319
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,406
Your infant daughter.

320
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh right.
Sorry. What's up?

321
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:27,345
Well a, this mission
feels fairly dangerous
and totally half-cocked.

322
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,514
[chuckles]
that's normally cock aplenty.

323
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,750

And what if kovacs dies,

324
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,284
And the cia disavows us,

325
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,953
And we're blacklisted
from intelligence work?

326
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,588
I'd have a lot more
free time?

327
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,258

your entire personal identity

328
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,294

Maybe I finally learn
to fly-fish.

00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,855
The sooner she learns
about cigarettes, the better.

356
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,292
This little pudge-pop's going
to need all the help she can get

357
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,828
In the battle of the bulge.
[babbles]

something happens to you,

00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,866

360

there's a malfunction

361
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,803

and the ship,

362
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,805
And everything in it
gets vaporized?

363
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,607
I'd just jump out

is being destroyed?

366

466
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,389
And then hopefully
a lifetime to be with him.

467
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,192
Once he leaves hilda.

468
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,793
<i>[slater]</i>
<i>control, I think</i>
<i>we're ready to start</i>

469
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,361
<i>Transport and injection, over.</i>

470
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,763
<i>[holly]</i>
<i>roger that, nereus.</i>

471
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,235
So, should we
be steering, or--
shh!

472
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,738
Okay. Now the submarine
is in a saline solution

473
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,109
In the syringe, which the robot
will now gently transport

474
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,743
Into the surgical theater,

475
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,246
Where it will prepare
to inject the solution

476
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,048
Into the cerebrospinal fluid

477
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,016
At the base
of dr. Kovacs' skull.

478
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,788
We're not weightless!
Why not?

479
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,990
And since
we only have...

480
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:50,161
59 minutes-ish until the nereus
reverts to normal size,

481
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,430
It is crucial that
the injection be as close

482
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,665
To the blood clot
as humanly--

483
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,834
Well, robotically possible,
I guess.

484
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,669
We're looking good
down here, control.

485
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,138
All lined up
on the injection site.

486
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,306
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>Nereus, are you ready?</i>

487
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,410
<i>[clanking]</i>
<i>[lana] ugh! Yes!</i>
<i>Let's get this over with!</i>

488
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,412
<i>You are a go</i>
<i>for injection, doctor.</i>

489
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,254
<i>[drone doctor]</i>
<i>preparing to inject.</i>
<i>[crashing, screaming]</i>

490
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:19,023
So should there
be screaming?

491
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,193
Shh! Control,
we're hearing some screaming.

492
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,363
<i>Which--</i>
<i>what's the story on that?</i>

493
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,366
What in the name
of sweet jiminy christ

494
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,101
Do you think
you're doing?

495
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,003
Standing up
for myself!

496
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,838
Because maybe
I didn't go to some

497
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,674
Fancy-pantsy
ivy league med school,

498
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,310
And maybe I didn't go
to some other med school,

499
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,845
Even the one
down in grenada,

500
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,114
Which was my fallback,
but whatever.

501
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,816
That doesn't give you
the right to bully me.

502
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,852
I have had it!

503
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,221
Oh, and by the way,

504
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:53,691
If I was a clone
of adolf goddamn hitler,

505
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,195
Wouldn't I look like
adolf goddamn hitler?

506
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,363
Huh. I never
thought about that.
Doctor?

507
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,332
What?
<i>Not you.</i>

508
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,067
Doctor, please tell me
that nereus

509
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,735
Was injected into kovacs?

510
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,337
It was.
<i>Whew, okay.</i>

511
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,039
<i>So we're still okay.</i>

512
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,974
I'm sorry. I should've
finished that thought.

513
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,878
It was injected into dr. Kovacs,
but not at the injection site.

514
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,347
What?
Well then, where is it?

515
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,682
His foot.

516
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,685
Wow. Now I feel
like dr. Dickwads.

517
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,354
Krieger, shut up!
And you, get them out of there.

518
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,090
[sighs] we can't.
They're way too small.

519
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,425
They'll just have
to make it to his tear duct

520
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,893
<i>Like we planned.</i>

521
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,695
Is there enough time
to make it to the clot,

522
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,029
Laser it,
and still escape?

523
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,365
I mean, it will
be close, but maybe.

524
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:39,203
Damn it!
[sighs] so do we tell them?

525
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,372
Well they'll find out
soon enough.

526
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,907
And in the meantime,

527
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,943
I'm sure sterling
has everything well in hand.
