1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:03,174
Torvald utne.

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,204
The olympic shot-putter?

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,278
The chairman of the

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:06,991
U.N. Intelligence committee.

5
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:08,559
Do you not even skim the

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,808
Briefings in your inbox?

7
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,126
I have an inbox?

8
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:12,502
Utne decides which

9
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:14,635
Spy agency gets the insanely

10
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,640
Lucrative u.N. Contract.

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,221
And as you may or...

12
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,719
...Probably don't know, for six

13
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,410
Years running, the contract has gone to odin.

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,627
The organization of douche bags

15
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,193
In -- in...

16
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:29,287
Wait, I had something for this.

17
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:30,755
Douche-baggery notwithstanding...

18
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,474
Nowheresville. ...Their ground floor

19
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:33,658
Isn't a laundromat.

20
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,840
Wash-and-fold, technically. Isis needs that u.N. Contract.

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,596
So I am going to woo mr. Torvald utne...

22
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:41,804
Gross.

23
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,799
...With a dinner party tonight.

24
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,825
And you're uninviting

25
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:45,364
Me in advance?

26
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:46,457
Normally, yes.

27
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:48,668
But this party is different and

28
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:51,259
Very important, so absolutely

29
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,714
Nothing can go wrong.

30
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:55,017
Well, then we better keep dr. Bellows away from jeannie.

31
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:55,938
No! No dates!

32
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:57,010
From "I dream of jeannie."

33
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,600
No one is bringing a date, so don't you bring a date.

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,159
Okay, but I don't want to get there and be the

35
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,486
Only one without a date.

36
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,622
And I don't want another one of your sullen

37
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,474
Whores using my medicine cabinet

38
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,922
Like a...

39
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,573
A pez dispenser!

40
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:12,645
Peggy, you will probably kill me for this.

41
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,651
But, senator, we now have a

42
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,356
Subway museum.

43
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:20,612
If -- are you still big into trains?

44
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:21,909
That wasn't her fault!

45
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,406
Who puts oxycontin in a xanax bottle?

46
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,030
People with servants, idiot!

47
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,642
But if they're stealing pills, how does it help

48
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:28,562
To switch the labels?

49
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:31,580
Because they can't read english!

50
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,230
okay.

51
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,380
×Ö
I'm gonna leave you to think about 

52
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,425
Ä»
that whole line of reasoning...

53
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:36,591
You think about it! ...And whatever

54
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,427
Scheme you're hatching for this dinner party.

55
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:40,668
There's no... Scheme-hatchery.

56
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,898
hello? Ja, guten tag.

57
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,009
Ist das -- do you mind?

58
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,447
It's the caterer. right.

59
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:47,466
Okay. Sure.

60
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,903
Your instructions are clear?

61
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,590
ja, ja. No problem.

62
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,609
Oh, I have other call.

63
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,640
Ja, okay!

64
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:54,947
Hello? hello.

65
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,430
oh, da, da.

66
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,609
so, your instructions are clear?

67
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:01,146
da. excellent.

68
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,148
uta, get dressed. We work tonight.

69
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:04,616
but, mani, what about

70
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,800
The fantasticks?

71
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,275
tomorrow, liebchen, I promise.

72
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,179
But -- oh.

73
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,034
You bought this ridiculous thing.

74
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,942
is it so ridiculous to ready

75
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:14,538
My body for the baby?!

76
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:17,403
uta, please do not start this.

77
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,858
Just ready your body for work, hmm?

78
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:22,501
fine. What is the job? two jobs.

79
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,621
The first, we make a big phony

80
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,164
Attempt to kill torvald utne.

81
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:28,231
okay.

82
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,821
And the second?

83
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:32,469
we kill torvald utne.

84
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,782
So, your instructions are clear?

85
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,468
drinks und fish balls.

86
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,573
You ring first bell for dinner.

87
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,009
Und on second bell, I come out

88
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,133
All john wooey, screaming crazy

89
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,433
Und shooting blanks.

90
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:16,353
Then I throw myself

91
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:18,124
In front of utne, shielding him

92
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:19,988
With my supple body as you're

93
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:22,157
Gunned down by isis agents.

94
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,282
who are also shooting blanks.

95
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,271
und loud ones.

96
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:29,113
Because for utne to buy it,

97
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,471
Everyone must act surprised.

98
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,214
Oh, I'm sure they will.

99
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,221
ja, me too.

100
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:36,144
mani, I have a bad feeling

101
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,544
For this. why?

102
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:39,887
Only I will have real bullets.

103
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,560
This is taking chocolate from a

104
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,135
Baby. oh, no.

105
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,683
We won't give our baby chocolate.

106
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,316
he can have carob.

107
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:48,769
thanks for inviting us to

108
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,340
Your swanky dinner party, ms. Archer.

109
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,482
Yeah, I could get used to this. Don't.

110
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,998
You're only here because I may

111
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,033
Need you to take one for the

112
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,133
Team.

113
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,569
Torvald is an incorrigible poon

114
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,689
Hound.

115
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,503
Those are enormous in size.

116
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,855
Oh, well, uh, thank you.

117
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:08,557
may I please cup one in my hand?

118
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,220
Ooh, see, here's the thing --

119
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,419
We're actually together.

120
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,506
Cyril, go get some

121
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:13,617
Gravlax.

122
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:14,801
Torvald, feel free to cup

123
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,067
Anything in the room.

124
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,897
Oh, you were talking about my guns.

125
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:20,948
it's strange that you'd wear

126
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,045
Them to a party.

127
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:22,738
You know, normally I

128
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:23,797
Wouldn't, but malory --

129
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,222
But that's isis for you -- always primed and ready

130
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,128
For action.

131
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,399
This is good to know.

132
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,099
Yeah. How about that?

133
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,041
Which is why you

134
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,599
Should consider isis for the

135
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,313
U.N. Contract.

136
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,480
Our agents are highly trained in

137
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,798
Many disciplines.

138
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,227
Like krav maga, for instance.

139
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,985
oh, my arm! You're breaking my arm!

140
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,613
Lana! Oh, I'm sorry.

141
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,223
Did that hurt? yes, it hurt!

142
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,441
What is wrong with you?!

143
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:52,023
Nothing but too much enthusiasm for the opportunity

144
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,494
To serve the u.N.

145
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,468
and hands like the truckasaurus.

146
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,474
Hey! Gravlax, anyone?

147
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:58,391
no! No gravlax!

148
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,473
I need painkillers!

149
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,519
Cyril, in my medicine

150
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,327
Cabinet -- wait, no!

151
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,145
I'll have to get it myself, just...

152
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:05,616
...Right after I get that.

153
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,185
Hello.

154
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,095
You're late.

155
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:10,973
What is that smell?

156
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:12,731
Gravlax and failure!

157
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:13,875
I think lana just broke

158
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,931
Torvald's hand!

159
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:15,895
Truckasaurus.

160
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:16,901
And we won't win that

161
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,393
Contract if -- who on god's

162
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,111
Green earth dressed you?!

163
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,832
Nobody -- that's why I'm late!

164
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,563
Woodhouse just disappeared.

165
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,200
only temporarily, sir.

166
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,972
Why are you here?

167
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:28,713
actually, sir, I'm with

168
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:29,813
Carina. Who?

169
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,113
carina!

170
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,859
I changed it again.

171
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:33,983
I feel that carina better

172
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,829
Captures my sensual womanhood.

173
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,322
Yeah, she so totally

174
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:37,984
Does.

175
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,201
And you said no dates!

176
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,242
I said no such thing.

177
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,174
Well, your mouth did.

178
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:41,970
Well, your mouth

179
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,178
Better get over there and make

180
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,094
Torvald happy!

181
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,131
Um, phrasing?

182
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,972
Regale him with

183
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,740
Exciting tales of isis exploits.

184
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,042
Take his mind off lana's huge,

185
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,752
Johnny benchian fingers.

186
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,792
Can we get off my fingers?

187
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,980
Yeah, they are pretty big.

188
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,660
First time I've heard

189
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,349
You complain.

190
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,241
heyo!

191
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:58,794
Seriously, who wants gravlax?

192
00:05:58,794 --> 00:05:59,842
Sterling, go!

193
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:00,664
Regale him!

194
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,560
I think he's already

195
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,502
Being regaled.

196
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:03,518
Meatballs!

197
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, for -- torvald!

198
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,896
Bet you get that a lot,

199
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:06,631
Huh, torvie?

200
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,567
Pam! Swedish meatballs.

201
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,120
get away from me, you

202
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,456
Disgusting woman.

203
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,125
Wow.

204
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,490
So even pam got a date.

205
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,386
A man, even.

206
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:15,769
But suave master spy

207
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,845
Sterling archer stands alone.

208
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,125
just like the cheese.

209
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,119
I have a -- and a very handsome cheese at

210
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:22,963
That, sir!

211
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,119
I don't even know how you got out, woodhouse.

212
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,409
And I do have a date.

213
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,798
You do? Where is she?

214
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:29,193
She is parking.

215
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,024
Oh, yeah?

216
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:30,799
What's she driving -- a

217
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:31,533
Snuffleupagus?

218
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,675
Ha, ha, ha.

219
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,710
Uh, oh, wait.

220
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,947
Uh, with all that sexy european

221
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,321
Lingerie modeling to pay for her

222
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,924
European med school that she's

223
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:41,716
Going to, she probably never had

224
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:42,948
Time to learn to drive.

225
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,549
She sounds fabulous.

226
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:46,418
gravlax?

227
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,252
Thanks, no.

228
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,967
I'm allergic to cat piss.

229
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,762
Go away.

230
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,192
so, your instructions are

231
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:53,709
Clear?

232
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,608
why must you micromanage

233
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:56,456
Everything?

234
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,745
Ja, ja, okay.

235
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,836
mani, was ist los?!

236
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,886
You know what secondhand smoke

237
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,166
Does to a fetus!

238
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,665
uta, after we kill utne, we

239
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,623
Need to have a very long und

240
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,237
Serious talk.

241
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,593
no!

242
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,697
I need a painkiller, not a...

243
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,241
Torvald.

244
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:12,966
what is that -- a calcium

245
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,639
Supplement?

246
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,556
Trust me, dear --

247
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:16,048
These work wonders.

248
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,380
okay.

249
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,761
But what I have seen

250
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,525
Isis is a distant second to

251
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,569
Odin -- very distant.

252
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,239
malory: Well, what about the

253
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,915
Groundbreaking work dr. Krieger

254
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:26,693
Is doing for isis in our applied

255
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,716
Research division?

256
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:28,810
Yeah, tell him about the

257
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,735
Sex robot!

258
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:30,420
the what?!

259
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,390
malory: Yes, the what?!

260
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,262
I call him fister roboto.

261
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,020
But it doesn't just

262
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,598
Fist.

263
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:35,826
malory: Pam... Tell him.

264
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:37,438
he's a fully integrated,

265
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,718
Multi-fetish artificial being.

266
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,912
that is the most

267
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:41,614
Disgusting --

268
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:42,924
shut up! Shh! Shh!

269
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,989
And the best part is that he's

270
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:45,909
Learning.

271
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,243
isis clearly is not the

272
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,859
Agency for us!

273
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,550
Rotten gravlax, sex-bots, and...

274
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,289
Except for the negress, the

275
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,040
Women are --

276
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,020
malory: Willing to do

277
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,178
Whatever it takes.

278
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:58,170
Still gross.

279
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,903
and such rudeness!

280
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:01,171
Fister roboto wouldn't

281
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:01,700
Take that.

282
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,614
he's just too damn sensitive!

283
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:05,440
as also am I.

284
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,314
So if you will excuse m--

285
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:08,011
There, there.

286
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,250
Let that calcium citrate seep

287
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,829
Into your bones.

288
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:12,723
What about trinette?

289
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:13,933
She said that?

290
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,399
How about jade?

291
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,917
Ew, no, never mind.

292
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,027
Destiny?!

293
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,614
No, she's not passable!

294
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:20,808
With that adam's apple, she

295
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,543
Looks like she swallowed a rubik's cube.

296
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,831
excuse me, sir?

297
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,163
I...

298
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,085
you are looking for a date?

299
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,204
Are you working?

300
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,932
you could say that, yes.

301
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:34,568
Then we need to lock

302
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,082
Down your cover story.

303
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,154
And...

304
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,302
I need to hit an atm.

305
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:43,349
Torvald, please.

306
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:44,277
Don't go yet.

307
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:45,781
You haven't even tried the fish

308
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:46,441
Balls.

309
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,375
no need!

310
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,760
There's plenty of fishiness

311
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,876
Going on at isis without your

312
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:51,718
Balls!

313
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:52,418
Maybe I should go say

314
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:52,927
Something.

315
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:53,354
Yeah.

316
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:55,101
Where's the damn fish balls already?

317
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,249
I could kill for some food.

318
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,139
Sure it wouldn't be the

319
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:57,761
First time.

320
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:58,259
Lana.

321
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,783
No, I just meant, like,

322
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,017
She literally killed somebody --

323
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,098
and then ate their corpse.

324
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:02,948
Yeah, I saw where you were going

325
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:03,460
With that.

326
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,324
You know...

327
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,915
when I served in the king's

328
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,856
African rifles, the local

329
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:10,083
Zambezi tribesmen called human

330
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,195
Flesh "Long pig."

331
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,283
Never much cared for it.

332
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:17,113
Torvald, at least

333
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,259
Stay for dinner!

334
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,203
I think you'll be very surprised by --

335
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:22,055
I detest surprises, which is

336
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:24,916
Why the contract will remain with odin.

337
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,796
mani, do something!

338
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:28,162
Utne is leaving!

339
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,009
okay, okay.

340
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,545
We go ahead of schedule.

341
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,928
Find some tooperware.

342
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:33,051
We take food to go.

343
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,090
but you promised me

344
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,121
Ruby foo's.

345
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,867
ja, I also promised you a baby.

346
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,757
How's that working out for you?

347
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,621
lana: Hey, does that cook seem weird?

348
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,921
cyril: Normal weird or german

349
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:42,632
Weird?

350
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,857
now, good night. And good...

351
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:49,287
...Evening, you beautiful girl.

352
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,798
hello. archer: You're not, um, leaving, are you?

353
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,106
no.

354
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,907
Not if you are staying, miss...

355
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,977
archer: Oh, um... hubsch.

356
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,369
archer: Yeah. elke hubsch.

357
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,982
a pleasure, my dear.

358
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,675
I am torvald --

359
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,611
utne. I know.

360
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,241
I am a great admirer.

361
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,147
both: Really? archer: You know he's not the shot-putter, right?

362
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:11,025
of course he is not the shot-putter.

363
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:14,030
But I am sure he is very strong.

364
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:15,715
Unlike these drinks.

365
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,197
Come, my dear.

366
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,637
Let us find something potable.

367
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,241
archer: Whoa, wait a minute.

368
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,615
Hey, utne! Utne!

369
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,790
malory: Would you shut up?!

370
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,003
We just need to keep torvald ppy until dinner.

371
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:29,643
archer: And what about my happiness, mother? Well?!

372
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,335
malory: Oh, was that not rhetorical?

373
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,452
scheisse! Das ist "Die nadel!"

374
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:37,603
the needle?!

375
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,631
Why is she here?!

376
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,283
oh, that russian prick!

377
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:42,339
He sent two teams again.

378
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:44,817
And if the needle kills utne, we

379
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,283
Won't even get our per diem!

380
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,741
but what if you kill them

381
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:48,947
Both?

382
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:50,753
Ja, I could do this.

383
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,193
archer: Hey, help! Help!

384
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,341
help with what, sir?

385
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:54,457
archer: No, I was addressing

386
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,650
You as "Help."

387
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,110
What's the story on those fish balls?

388
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,908
coming right out.

389
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,991
archer: Well, hurry it up, all right?

390
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,507
All I've had today is like six

391
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,643
Gummi bears and some scotch.

392
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:03,587
gott im himmel!

393
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:04,750
this is why I don't get you

394
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,372
Nice things.

395
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:06,318
not that -- him!

396
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,853
Uta, that was duchess!

397
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,734
that was duchess?! ja!

398
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,790
The deadliest agent there is!

399
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,582
archer: Oh, my god.

400
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,971
I can't believe they fell for that.

401
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,217
but if he's on the plan of

402
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,402
Frau archer, then --

403
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:21,041
what if her plan is a big fat setup?!

404
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,211
What if they mean to kill us?!

405
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:24,947
Mani, the baby!

406
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,585
Okay, so, now we go to

407
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,720
Plan manfred.

408
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
and then ruby foo's.

409
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,977
well, we will see.

410
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:33,367
really?

411
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,913
A european lingerie model?

412
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:38,567
only to pay for european med school.

413
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,195
like to get a physical from her.

414
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,291
or with her.

415
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,547
I wonder if dr. Panty model knows how many

416
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:46,667
Pounds of pressure it takes to

417
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,885
Snap a human collarbone.

418
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:48,813
She probably uses the

419
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:49,783
Metric system.

420
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,658
Yeah, what do they use -- kilowatts?

421
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:52,475
no.

422
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,497
In this case, it would be pascals.

423
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,231
ugh. Hey, europe -- be gayer.

424
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,671
Lana, release him!

425
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,223
As you wish.

426
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,227
I find your lack of

427
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,342
Faith disturbing.

428
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:02,390
I find your mannish

429
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,470
Hands disturbing.

430
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,054
I think they're kind of sexy.

431
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:05,708
Excuse me?

432
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,225
they're fingers, pam, not kielbasas.

433
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:09,559
But keep them limbered up.

434
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,484
I have a big surprise planned

435
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:13,144
For dinner, and I need you

436
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:15,115
Ready, locked, and loaded!

437
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,380
Yeah, so, do you maybe

438
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,761
Want to let us in on your little

439
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,183
Scheme-hatchery?

440
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:21,673
No.

441
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,480
oh, if I were 20 years

442
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,293
Yo unger!

443
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,799
I can make you feel like you

444
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,500
Are.

445
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,740
I would like, I tnk, that

446
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,828
Very much.

447
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:30,570
Well, then go find an

448
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,424
Atm.

449
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,354
I'm sorry?

450
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,433
oh, me too.

451
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,769
I must leave for a moment.

452
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:36,648
Excuse me.

453
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,248
Yeah, sorry.

454
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,334
Don't mind me!

455
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,251
Hey, are you having a good time?

456
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,047
oh, I am!

457
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:42,909
Good to hear.

458
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,678
Please excuse us.

459
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,226
Keep her out of the medicine

460
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,061
Cabinet!

461
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,801
One more dead body in here, and

462
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,299
That bitch trudy beekman will

463
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,851
Have me right back in front of

464
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:53,725
The co-op board!

465
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,266
Wow, you don't get

466
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,092
Along with your neighbors

467
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:55,748
Anywhere.

468
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:56,509
Who could get along

469
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,034
With a woman who wallpapered her

470
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,607
Guest bathroom with vintage

471
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,310
New yorker covers?

472
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:02,506
yes, major.

473
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,518
I am in position and ready to

474
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,002
Eliminate the target.

475
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,145
excellent.

476
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:09,062
Odin will find it much harder to

477
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:11,005
Bribe a dead man for the u.N.

478
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:11,857
Contract.

479
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,952
And I will find it much more

480
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:16,257
Enjoyable to work with the woman

481
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:17,449
Who runs isis.

482
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:18,637
what do you mean "With"?

483
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:21,263
"Against," Obviously.

484
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:22,123
Duh.

485
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,172
obviously.

486
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,497
Und so I still think you should

487
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,063
Let me kill everybody here.

488
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:26,756
nyet!

489
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,633
Under no circumstances are you

490
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,881
To harm the hostess, who, um,

491
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,891
Whose name I have no way of knowing.

492
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:34,562
Hey, what the hell

493
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:35,540
Are you doing?!

494
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:37,323
Botox?

495
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,863
Not from the medicine cabinet!

496
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,074
No, don't use this!

497
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,545
She switches all the labels on

498
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:42,890
Her medicine. why?

499
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,536
I don't know.

500
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,536
I think there's, like, a racial component.

501
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,727
But for all we know, this could be insulin.

502
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,609
oh, your mother is a diabetic?

503
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:51,638
How should I know?

504
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,762
why don't you just pour it on everybody's?

505
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,877
because our employer was very

506
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,548
Clear -- we are not to harm the hostess.

507
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:00,457
but her I want to poison most of all.

508
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,627
Are you lazy huns

509
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:02,531
Ready or what?!

510
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,443
oh hello. Yep! Good.

511
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,770
So, on the second bell...

512
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,969
I come out shooting blanks. See?

513
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,671
Uta is just, um, polishing the gun.

514
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:11,493
Give me that!

515
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:13,027
Some idiot dropped a fish ball

516
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,014
On my azerbaijani rug!

517
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,139
I am that idiot!

518
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,579
ugh. Why are you so immature?

519
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,749
I'm 19.

520
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,903
elke, is everything all right?

521
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,738
wunderbar, torvald.

522
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,640
How are you?

523
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,497
I am fantastic, my dear.

524
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,751
Those calcium supplements are

525
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:33,966
Amazing.

526
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,572
You're gonna need some calcium after I do

527
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:38,885
Something bad to your bones.

528
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,302
hello? Hello?

529
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,649
can you hear me?

530
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:42,604
Come in!

531
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,497
Wait, what the hell?

532
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:45,682
what is the frequency? Kenneth?

533
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,701
turn off! Turn off!

534
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,288
Turn off! What?

535
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,604
I-I can't hear you, tiny man.

536
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:51,875
Wh-- oh, great!

537
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,088
Thanks, mother, for replacing

538
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,335
The baby aspirin with lsd!

539
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:56,847
God, that is just...

540
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,886
Mmm, classic her.

541
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,474
Places, everyone!

542
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,300
Is everyone comfy?

543
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,935
Sterling and lana?

544
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:07,750
You both have a clear line of...

545
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,558
Sight to the kitchen? Yes.

546
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,366
Sure. I think so. Well, then let's eat.

547
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,026
First bell!

548
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,192
Forgot how much I hated that.

549
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:17,567
Oh, that's right.

550
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,986
I kept it on the nightstand to

551
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,306
Wake nanny whenever sterling wet the bed.

552
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,262
Mother!

553
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:28,057
wait, whose bed? it was always

554
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,751
"Don't ask, don't tell."

555
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,415
Woodhouse! What are you doing?!

556
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:32,704
uh, sitting down, sir.

557
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,190
What, at the table?! Sterling.

558
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,518
Like people?! Sterling!

559
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,353
What?! Look, he thinks he's people!

560
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,921
this archer is a gigantic

561
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,523
Douche bag. oh, torvald.

562
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,819
Who cares about him?

563
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,887
Woodhouse, dear, please have a seat.

564
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:49,595
very kind of you, ma'am.

565
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:51,317
Shut up. Torvald, a toast?

566
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,407
sure. Go crazy. Oh!

567
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,659
Then, um... Hooray.

568
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,650
Wow. Dig in.

569
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,691
And what is this we're eating?

570
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,375
It smells vaguely poisonous.

571
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,967
It does smell vaguely

572
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,097
Poisonous.

573
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,490
are you sure she has the

574
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,545
Right plate?

575
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,927
pretty sure.

576
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,270
uta! what?!

577
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,693
I am pretty sure.

578
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:13,154
don't worry -- this is a

579
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:14,194
Normal smell!

580
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:16,728
This is called janssons frestelse.

581
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:18,910
frestel-- yes, frestelse.

582
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,620
It means "Temptation."

583
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,456
oh, torvald!

584
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:25,555
I am very tempted.

585
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,486
yes, and I am tempted to give

586
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,980
Isis the u.N. Contract, malory.

587
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,726
I mean, you are?!

588
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,162
well, that depends on your

589
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,850
Frestelse.

590
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,056
tell me, my dear, is it

591
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:39,208
Tempting?

592
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,910
elke, what is the matter?!

593
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,259
A-a-are you...

594
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,382
What? that's the wrong plate!

595
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,553
Uta!

596
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,933
"Uta!" That's how you talk.

597
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,340
perfidy! No!

598
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,726
Torvald, there's no perfidy!

599
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,636
you poisoned my food over a contract?!

600
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,528
Torvald, I swear I didn't!

601
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:58,594
well, when I am finished with

602
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:00,144
Isis, you won't be able to get a

603
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,128
Contract for a prepaid mobile phone!

604
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,194
I will tear you down, brick by

605
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:07,681
Perfidious brick!

606
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,600
It's okay! It's okay!

607
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,979
They're just blanks!

608
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,000
oh. Well, see, you say that...

609
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,107
But they were blanks, weren't they?

610
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,204
Only if the back of his skull picked that exact

611
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,634
Moment to explode outwards.

612
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,623
What?! Oh, my god!

613
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:25,681
Damn it! What?

614
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,672
Where are those germans?!

615
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,257
I should not do this in my condition.

616
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,003
what condition?!

617
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,449
Your only condition is that you

618
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:34,036
Are a stupid, crazy girl!

619
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,467
do not speak to me like a

620
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:36,512
Child, manfred!

621
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:37,738
I hate when you do that!

622
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,127
I think you like it, ja!

623
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,541
Because I think you have some

624
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,179
Serious und unresolved issues with your father!

625
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:44,075
ja?! ja.

626
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:45,769
und maybe that is why I date

627
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,209
A wrinkled old man like you!

628
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,240
I didn't mean that. no, no -- is okay. oh, mani.

629
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,851
I think we both knew it.

630
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,441
Just strange to hear it out loud.

631
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,841
Oh, for shit's sake.

632
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,315
And they didn't do one dish.

633
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,934
This is funny to you?!

634
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:05,721
I ate a bunch of that

635
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,465
Lsd you had labeled as baby aspirin.

636
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,362
That was baby aspirin.

637
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:10,841
Hey, guys? Wait, what?!

638
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,851
What, uh...

639
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,162
What's the plan here?

640
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:14,458
I shall fetch a rug!

641
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,655
No, you will not!

642
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:16,835
That rug was a gift from the

643
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,996
Azeri khan himself!

644
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:21,855
And besides, we're not going

645
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:22,986
Far.

646
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,699
is that hard to do with those big ol' ballpark

647
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:27,775
Franken-fingers?

648
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,638
Shut up. Hurry up -- the

649
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:32,091
Beekmans will be back anytime.

650
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,779
And nobody touch anything!

651
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,302
God, cyril, would you go?

652
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,154
I should be carrying her.

653
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:38,439
archer: Cyril, I paid her, I

654
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,709
Get to carry her corpse. malory: See?

655
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,228
Just look at this bathroom!

656
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,364
I kind of like it.

657
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:45,794
malory: Exactly. All right, drop them there, next

658
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:48,330
To that awful louis quinze repro.

659
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,382
malory: Now, then. We want this to look like a

660
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,565
Classic hooker/murder/suicide.

661
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,441
So...

662
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,271
Cyril, take sterling's gun, and

663
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:58,816
Pump a round into his prostitute. cyril: Wait, what?!

664
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:00,232
malory: Everyone shoots the chippy!

665
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:01,849
That way, we're all in it together.

666
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,859
Think of it as a team-building exercise.

667
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:06,729
cyril: But odin gets to go on outward bound!

668
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,075
malory: Well, odin can suck it! Now shoot!

669
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,892
cyril: Oh, jesus. malory: You're next!

670
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,414
archer: God, cyril, that was pathetic. malory: Come on!

671
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,692
Everybody shoots!

672
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,499
Now, sterling, drop your gun between the bodies, and --

673
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:22,070
archer: No! Have you ever seen "Csi"?

674
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,764
This is already like clue town.

675
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:24,897
malory: Not for long.

676
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,091
Dr. Krieger, dear?

677
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:27,302
wha-- oh.

678
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:28,712
malory: Cyril, call 911 from

679
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:29,726
Their phone, and leave it off

680
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,932
The hook, and -- sterling!

681
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:33,908
archer: But this gun -- it was a gift! malory: Oh, please!

682
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,888
Nobody gives you gifts!

683
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,222
archer: You don't know.

684
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:39,249
malory: Whatever you say, dear.

685
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,672
Dr. Krieger?

686
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,786
oh! Hot potato!

687
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,726
Now, then. We still didn't get the u.N. Contract.

688
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,012
malory: Oh, but I will.

689
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:48,495
And I'll get to see

690
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:50,373
Trudy beekman try to explain

691
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,003
This little barbecue to the

692
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:53,193
Co-op board!

693
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,957
that smell takes me back --

694
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:56,740
Just like a zambezi feast.

695
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,688
Yeah, I'm kind of hungry. Is that weird?

696
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,862
malory: It would be weirder if you weren't.

697
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,647
cyril: Well, this torte's a winner, malory.

698
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:05,883
What was the name again?

699
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,385
malory: Kladdkaka.

700
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,893
malory: Stop it!

701
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,394
archer: I'm sorry. That's -- that's a funny word.

702
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:21,477
I thought we were laughing at

703
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,989
The dead people we set on fire.

704
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:28,537
Sorry.

705
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:29,537
