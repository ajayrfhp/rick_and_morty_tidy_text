1
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:10,603
MAN: Okay kids, who
wants Manning Coleslaw?

2
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:14,919
And/or an explanation of why that's...

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,351
funny.

4
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,647
Sorry, guys, we're, um...

5
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,670
closed, yeah.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,287
Thanks for getting aside from me because

7
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:25,519
we are closed.

8
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,284
Especially now that the door is locked.

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,356
And you're not really supposed
to be back here.

10
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,381
Even if you have a, a...

11
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,564
- I was gonna say a hairnet.
- Bob?

12
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,664
- Is everything...
- Everything's fine, we're...

13
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,049
- Closed, Bob...
- Linda!

14
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,740
Take the kids in the back.
Kids, go in the back with your mom.

15
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:44,294
Not really want.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,899
*** goes Linda, now would you please
go in the goddamn back?

17
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,214
Well, excuse me, "Ike Turner".

18
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,917
Look, the hamburger wasn't a big seller,
so there's not much.

19
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:55,240
- But um...
- We don't want money.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,595
We want you.

21
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,347
- I'm sorry?
- We are not robbers.

22
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:02,747
Oh, my god. Okay, yes,
you can rob them, but...

23
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,354
just please don't hurt my family.

24
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:06,709
- We're not robbers.
- Oh.

25
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:09,437
- Well, then, what do you want?
- You.

26
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:12,059
- ***.
- Da.

27
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:13,912
ARCHER: Wh-? No!

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,029
GOON 1: Ty sukin syn, ISIS shpion!

29
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:34,601
Even if you kill us,
more will come, Archer!

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,602
ARCHER: Khorosho!

31
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,237
Ya ih toje zamochu togda!

32
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,508
LINDA: Bob!

33
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,610
ARCHER: Oh my God, are you guys okay?!

34
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,813
LINDA: We -- yeah, we're -- but... Bob!

35
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,482
Where'd you learn how to do that?!

36
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:52,619
ARCHER: I -- I dunno,
it was like, instinct.

37
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,054
LINDA: And were you speaking Russian?!

38
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:54,888
ARCHER: Was I?

39
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,125
But I don't even know any -- Russian!

40
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:00,128
Look, the label in his coat has
those idiot Russian letters!

41
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,997
LINDA: Why the hell are
Russians trying to kill you?!

42
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,065
ARCHER: I don't know!

43
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,567
He called me "Archer," maybe
they think I'm somebody else...

44
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:07,570
LINDA: (gasps) Somebody who gambles?!

45
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:08,971
ARCHER: When would I gamble, Linda?!

46
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,706
The six hours a night I get to sleep?!

47
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:14,610
Because the other eighteen hours, I'm
slaving over this hot-ass grill!

48
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,514
LINDA: I didn't know it was
such a burden...

49
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,349
ARCHER: Wh-? Of course it's a burden!

50
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,020
Don't get me wrong, I love you guys,
but come on... I've been here two months,

51
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,723
it feels like two... trillion eons.

52
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,027
LINDA: Well if that's the way you -- what
are you doing, you're not leaving?!

53
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,095
ARCHER: Linda, you heard him!

54
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,031
Whoever they are, he
said they'd keep coming!

55
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,566
You guys aren't safe if I'm around!

56
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,902
LINDA: But Bobby...
ARCHER: No buts.

57
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,503
I'm not gonna let you guys get hurt.

58
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,239
What I am gonna do, is find out
who this Archer jerk is, and

59
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,909
why Russian people want him dead.

60
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,044
I'm also probably gonna do a spa weekend.

61
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:51,182
Between work and being a stepdad
to Gene and Louise and, um...

62
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,051
anyway, I am just burned out.

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,322
So take care, and I'll call after I
solve this mystery, or whatever.

64
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,758
Oh, and I forgot to tell you the health
inspector's coming at eight A.M.,

65
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:04,096
so you better break out the purple stuff.

66
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:33,514

67
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:41,525
MALORY: I'm sorry, I'm
sure I misheard you...

68
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,577
Sterling has been

69
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:47,448
missing for two months, we've spent God
knows how many thousands of dollars and

70
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:51,318
manhours searching for him,
and this whole time he's just

71
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,853
down at the shore flipping hamburgers?

72
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,605
You know another kind of burger?

73
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,407
Ostrich. Shut up, they're good.

74
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,136
- Shut up!
- Yes, shut up!

75
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:02,195
Then explain to me
if you know where Sterling is.

76
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:03,150
Was.

77
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,706
Oh, according to our intel,

78
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:07,632
he was tracked down by a KGB hit squad.

79
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,118
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

80
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:13,060
I should have started that with
"Archer is fine".

81
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,612
The KGB hit squad...

82
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,785
Oh my God!

83
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,945
- Not so much.
- My God!

84
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,123
- But, so, where is he now?
- At a spa.

85
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:25,123
According to his... um, wife.

86
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:27,367
His what?

87
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:30,046
Linda. She said he's name was Bob.

88
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,482
He wandered in there in full morning dress
2 months ago, they got married,

89
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,778
Married? The minute they met?

90
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,855
- Who does that?
- Ostriches.

91
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:38,855
Son of a...

92
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:41,750
He's obviously doing this
just to get even with me.

93
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,688
Normally, I would agree, but after
talking to the wife,

94
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,427
I honestly think Archer

95
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,150
doesn't know he's Archer.

96
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,273
How could he not know who he is?

97
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,529
Psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

98
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,459
Also known as a fluke statement,

99
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,721
sometimes triggered by extreme
emotional or psychological stress.

100
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:02,881
- And we all know what caused that!
- Yes, his hatred of seeing me happy.

101
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,849
Now take me to that spa!

102
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:07,666
And we'll just see how
this amnesia holds up

103
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:11,999
against a sudden and quite possibly
violent confrontation with his mother.

104
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,480
Ba-ba-ba-ba...

105
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,509
Bad idea!

106
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,536
According to my clinical research
on drug induced amnesia...

107
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:19,926
Said the fake scientist...

108
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,937
- Hmm, and what are your parents' names?
- What?

109
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,320
Their names are...

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,456
um, uh...

111
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,954
Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me?

112
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:30,312
You don't remember?

113
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,495
Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.

114
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:36,859
And if Archer's real identity
is exposed to him too suddenly,

115
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,383
his mind may reject it permanently.

116
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,293
We have to ease him back into it,

117
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,089
like a latex gimp suit.

118
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,905
And how do you suggest we do that?

119
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,086
Well, some people use baby powder.

120
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,606
I'm a firm believer in corn starch.

121
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,133
Not the gimp suit!

122
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,263
- Sterling's amnesia!
- Oh.

123
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:54,287
Yes, I have a plant.

124
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,051
Plant?

125
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,051
Plan.

126
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm serious.

127
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:01,506
I want it on record that I think
this is a terrible plan.

128
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,681
Duly noted and disregarded.

129
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,287
And I expect you to be totally convincing.

130
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,867
As the damsel in distress?

131
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,905
Have you ever met a woman less damsel-y?

132
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,253
Pam. And it's not you I'm worried about.

133
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,184
It's our pathetic villains.

134
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:17,295
Guys! Fake mustache, yay or nay?

135
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,301
- Yay!
- Yeah, it works, right?

136
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,498
My face isn't a naturally
villainous like yours, so...

137
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,675
Here's an idea, why don't you just
saw your goddamn head off?

138
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:27,335
Geez, what's up your butt?

139
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,150
Nothing is up my butt, Cyril.

140
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,191
Oh, or maybe there is.
I wouldn't know.

141
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,034
Because I'm paralyzed from waist down
and it's Archer's fault!

142
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:37,812
So, getting some mileage on to that, huh?

143
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,705
Ugh, now damsel up and get over there.

144
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:43,855
And remember, you have to pretend
you don't have a history together.

145
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,275
For the... Sour mix?

146
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,514
In a margarita?

147
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,761
What is this? Auschwitz?

148
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,969
I always do.

149
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:56,129
Like a big brown giraffe.

150
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,055
Uh, or an ostrich.

151
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,833
Remind me why I let you idiots come.

152
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,006
For the free rooms?

153
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,276
Cause the only thing you are
more than mean is cheap.

154
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:06,041
Shut up.

155
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,152
And just because you own this place...

156
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,793
I think I just own the conglomerate

157
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,448
that owns the holding company
that owns the hotel chain that owns it.

158
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:16,770
Don't even think about screwing up
our plan to cure Sterling's amnesia.

159
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,619
His what?

160
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,977
Five ingredients: tequila,

161
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:23,876
cointreau, lime juice, ice, koja salt.

162
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:28,170
Oh, and sorry about the Auschwitz crack.
That's not like me.

163
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,564
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

164
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,725
- I'm not Jewish.
- Did I ask for your life story?

165
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,964
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

166
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,371
Yes. No.

167
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,495
I mean, um, please,

168
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,135
feel free... to... always... do... that.

169
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:42,071
- Hi, I'm Bob.
- Lana Kane.

170
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:45,244
And thanks. I just need to rest a minute.
I've been on the run, I mean,

171
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,766
- on the go, and..
- Wait...

172
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:50,145
- You're on the run too?
- No, I...

173
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,558
Forget I said that.

174
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,510
It's dangerous, and you're married.

175
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,325
- And...
- What, this? No, this...

176
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,508
This is fake, I just wear it
to fend off the cougars.

177
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,866
Like her. She's totally checking me out.

178
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,619
- Eww.
- Ew.

179
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,730
Right? So why are you on the run?

180
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,598
Bob,

181
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:09,080
have you ever heard of ISIS?

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,097
From the Shazam/Isis Hour TV show?

183
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,228
- No, the...
- Remember Shazam?

184
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,432
Wait, who's the actor that
played Billy Batson? Remember, he'd go...

185
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,338
- Shazaaaaam!
- Arch... Bob!

186
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,828
- What?
- ISIS!

187
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:24,060
Is the International Secret
Intelligence Service

188
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,627
and I'm one of, oh, frankly,

189
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:27,749
I'm their best agent.

190
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,020
And KGB agents are trying to kill me.

191
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,265
Huh. Me too!

192
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,635
Wait, I wonder if it's related
to your thing.

193
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,251
Wait, why are you at the same spa as me?

194
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:38,103
I, uh...

195
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:41,225
Not even the best agent of this pool.

196
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,205
Seriously, how are we both at...

197
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:45,744
I think I see a KGB agent! Kiss me!

198
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:53,461
LANA: Okay, he's gone.

199
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:58,959
ARCHER: Glad I could help...
LANA: I could use more help.

200
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,528
But I have to warn you,
it could be dangerous.

201
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:04,631
ARCHER: For you, Lana, I will
take the highway right into the

202
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,500
danger zo - oh my God!

203
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:07,100
LANA: What?!

204
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,568
ARCHER: Michael Gray!

205
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:09,736
Was Billy Batson.

206
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,904
On Shazam.

207
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:18,054
MALORY: Krieger, I'm really having second
thoughts about your so-called plan.

208
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,222
KRIEGER: Give it time!

209
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,825
This isn't "The Flintstones",
we can't just whang him in the

210
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,159
head with a frying pan!

211
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:23,960
GILLETTE: How bout a bullet?

212
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:24,661
CYRIL: Burn.

213
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,462
MALORY: Oh give it a rest, Ironsides.

214
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:27,263
CYRIL: Burn.

215
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:29,131
LANA: And please! Focus!

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,470
ARCHER: Sorry, I'm trying, it's just...
TEC-9's are awesome!

217
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,508
[ Brrrrrrrrrrrrrt! ]

218
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,511
Wait, how'd I know these
are called TEC-9's?

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,881
LANA: Uh, well --
KRIEGER: Remember, ease him into it!

220
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,249
Like a --
MALORY: Enough!

221
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:44,950
With the gimp suits!

222
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,485
LANA: Will you shut up?!

223
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,353
KRIEGER: Sorry.

224
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:50,056
ARCHER: Sorry, it's just I don't know
what's happening, this is all crazy.

225
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,491
I'm a fry-cook, but I
know all about guns?

226
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,695
Russian spies who think my name
is Archer are trying to kill me?

227
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,030
I speak Russian?

228
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,500
Oh, and plus I'm a total
badass at hand-to-hand combat?

229
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:01,267
LANA: Pff.

230
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,071
ARCHER: No, seriously, I'm
like Chuck Norris-esque.

231
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,739
LANA: Okay, hit me.

232
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:06,406
ARCHER: What?

233
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,208
Right here, take your best shot.

234
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:09,176
ARCHER: I'm not gonna hit you.

235
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,579
LANA: Why, is your vagina bothering you?

236
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:12,280
ARCHER: Okay.

237
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,448
I see what you're doing.

238
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,316
But I warned you.

239
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:20,721
Hiiiiii --
ARCHER: Ya.

240
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,456
I think you literally broke my heart.

241
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,492
KRIEGER: Aww...
LANA: Shut up.

242
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,093
ARCHER: Sorry.

243
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:28,899
So yeah, wow, maybe I'm not as
good as I thought...

244
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,866
LANA: Duh. Okay, the first thing we need
to do is search the entire spa for --

245
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,301
ARCHER: An ice machine, totally, yes.

246
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,702
LANA: KGB agents.

247
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:38,071
Specifically these two.

248
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,240
ARCHER: Did you say gay-GB?

249
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,408
KRIEGER: Aww...
CYRIL: Think it's the mustache?

250
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:43,309
GILLETTE: It's not helping.

251
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:45,745
CYRIL: Well neither are you, so --
GILLETTE: To reiterate!

252
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,545
I am paralyzed!

253
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:47,179
CYRIL: Well?!

254
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:48,547
Join a support group!

255
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,216
MALORY: For who, crippled
gay hillbilly spies?

256
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,618
GILLETTE: [huge, weary sigh]

257
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,819
MALORY: There's a niche.

258
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,220
Alright you two, you're on.

259
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,857
So try, against all odds,
not to cock it up.

260
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,259
PAM: Speaking of, you see the
bulge on that towel boy?

261
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,129
Man, if I was you I'd be at
this spa twenty-five-eight.

262
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,365
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but then I wouldn't
get to hang out with everybody at work.

263
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,267
PAM: You hate everybody at work.

264
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,301
CHERYL/CAROL: I know.

265
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,570
It's the only thing that gets
me out of bed every morning.

266
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,804
PAM: The hatred.

267
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,539
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes, Pam.

268
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,907
The hatred.

269
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,943
[ contented sigh ]

270
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,914
ARCHER: Man, this spy stuff is awesome,
and I bet I'd be totally awesome at it,

271
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,616
so is ISIS hiring, or...?

272
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,617
LANA: No.

273
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,852
ARCHER: What, is it weird
because we kissed?

274
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:32,022
LANA: That was weird, and also not a real
kiss, and also never happening again.

275
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,323
ARCHER: Oh, I get it.

276
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,758
You're not into guys.

277
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,629
LANA: O.K. so -- Just because I don't
wanna bang you, automatically I'm a

278
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,463
lesbian?

279
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,399
ARCHER: Yes, well, that
and your Hulk hands.

280
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,903
LANA: I do not, have -- ARCHER:
She-Hulk, then, whatever, they're --

281
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:46,904
LANA: Arch -- Bob!

282
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,805
ARCHER: What, Jennifer Walters.

283
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,208
Alter-ego of She-Hulk, what.

284
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,042
LANA: KGB agents, twelve o'clock.

285
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:53,611
ARCHER: Wh-?

286
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,612
CYRIL: Dunt move a
mussels, Amerikyetskis!

287
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,248
ARCHER: And, wait, how
are they a superpower?

288
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:02,384
CYRIL: Oh no, kepitalist
spy get drup on us!

289
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,587
LANA: Okay, KGB agents, I want
you to reach into your jackets

290
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,090
very slowly and --
KGB AGENT: Drup your weapons!

291
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,792
LANA: Oh, shit.

292
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,828
KGB AGENT: And prepare
to die, Sterling Archer!

293
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,964
ARCHER: Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!

294
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:24,033
For the last time, assholes,
my name is -- Shazaaaaaaaaaam!

295
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:27,610
ARCHER: How do you not
remember that show?

296
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,702
ARCHER: So, uh, what's the plan here?

297
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,337
LANA: I don't have a plan!

298
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,472
Because those guys are the real KGB!

299
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,774
ARCHER: What, as opposed
to the fake KGB?!

300
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,009
LANA: Actually yes, and also --

301
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,012
LANA: Fake bullets!

302
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,515
ARCHER: What?!

303
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,150
Why do we have fake bullets?!

304
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:49,851
LANA: Yeah, Krieger!

305
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,752
Why do we?!

306
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:53,388
KRIEGER: No no no, you don't know my--
ARCHER: Why do you know the KGB

307
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,422
guy's name?!

308
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,391
LANA: Ugh, because --
KRIEGER: Bup bup bup bup bup!

309
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,292
Gimp suit!

310
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,563
ARCHER: Unless... oh my God, you're KGB!

311
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:04,901
LANA: Oh for -- if I'm KGB why
is the KGB shooting at me?!

312
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,671
ARCHER: Internal power struggle?

313
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,272
LANA: Dammit! Ray!

314
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,040
LANA: Ray, we are Code Zulu!

315
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,341
MALORY: Code Zulu?

316
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,810
She knows better than that.

317
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,212
Code Zulu is only for real emergencies.

318
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,179
LANA: Raaaaay!

319
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,714
GILLETTE: Yeah, she's
laying it on pretty thick.

320
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,416
MALORY: Well, you're in charge here.

321
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,285
I'm off to get a seaweed wrap.

322
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,086
GILLETTE: Didn't know they
made sushi with dried clams.

323
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:24,887
MALORY: What was that?!

324
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,390
LANA: The real KG --
GILLETTE: What was that?

325
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,993
I can't hear you over the
sound of mlah blah blah.

326
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:31,927
LANA: Ray?!

327
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:32,895
Ray!

328
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:34,630
What the hell is that sound?

329
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,566
ARCHER: Hamilton Beach 727 DrinkMaster.

330
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,569
And speaking of drinks...
LANA: These aren't to drink, dumbass!

331
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:42,271
I'm gonna make Molotov cocktails!

332
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,672
ARCHER: Not with Irish cream you're not.

333
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,442
LANA: Will you -- Bob!

334
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,776
Oh my God.

335
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,246
ARCHER: Yeah, it's pretty thick.

336
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:50,946
LANA: Krieger!

337
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:52,015
We need suppressing fire!

338
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:52,569
KRIEGER: Wh-?

339
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,416
We're shooting blanks, duh!

340
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,317
LANA: They don't know that!

341
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,151
Duh!

342
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,091
CYRIL: Burn... Inappropriate,
suppressing fiiiiiire!

343
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,725
LANA: Great!

344
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:07,763
Just buy us some time, so--
So, I have a question...

345
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:11,067
Why did you rip off my shirt...
ARCHER: To make the fuses, duh.

346
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,103
LANA: When there's a huge stack of
bar towels right freaking there!

347
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,771
ARCHER: Oh. Duh.

348
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,776
LANA: And, follow-up, why did you
also rip off my bikini top?!

349
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,177
ARCHER: For the slingshot.

350
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:21,845
LANA: Wh-?!

351
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:25,683
ARCHER: See, we put the bottle in
the, whatever, the boob cups, and --

352
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,518
LANA: Just throw the damn thing!

353
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,786
ARCHER: Oh my God, double-duh!

354
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,155
Right? Huh?

355
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:32,923
KGB AGENT: Zahodi s boku!

356
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:34,557
LANA: Dammit, they're gonna flank us!

357
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,560
So you wanna throw that today, or...?

358
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:39,295
ARCHER: No, now I feel bad for
setting your bikini on fire.

359
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:40,096
Here, hold this.

360
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:40,730
LANA: Wh-?

361
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,866
I don't wanna hold the damn --
ARCHER: Yeah, I think that works--

362
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,153
whoa, I am getting some
major déjà vu here...

363
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:48,370
LANA: It's not déjà vu,

364
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,638
you idiot!

365
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,073
ARCHER: Well however you pronounce it!

366
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,341
LANA: Rrrgh!

367
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,711
KGB AGENT: Koktyiel Molotova!

368
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,878
ARCHER: Whoooo!

369
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:57,380
Did you see that?!

370
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,550
LANA: Yes! Here, keep throwing them!

371
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,885
ARCHER: Whoooo!

372
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,620
Another one!

373
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:09,192
Wait, wait a minute...
MALORY: What in the... is that smoke?

374
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,859
PAM: Duh.

375
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:10,460
MALORY: Wh-?

376
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,894
Are you out of your mind?!

377
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:12,895
PAM: Damn near.

378
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:16,199
This shit is el crónico.

379
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,701
Gracias, Julio, you are the man.

380
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,670
CHERYL/CAROL: And you are also fired.

381
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:21,779
PAM: What?!
JULIO: Que?!

382
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,473
CHERYL/CAROL: I'm sorry, but
all of my companies have a

383
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,842
zero-tolerance drug policy.

384
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,611
PAM: You hypocrite cooze, I just
watched you eat a whole bag of

385
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,246
LSD gummi bears!

386
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,048
CHERYL/CAROL: Right?

387
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,551
And I am tripping bear balls!

388
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm kidding, Julio, you're not fired.

389
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,256
In fact, I'm making you the new GM.

390
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,958
PAM: Aww...
JULIO: General manager?!

391
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:41,792
Of the spa?!

392
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:44,461
CHERYL/CAROL: No, dipshit,
of the entire hotel chain.

393
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,430
JULIO: Multinational
Hotels Incorporated?!

394
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:47,264
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.

395
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,572
I guess I don't own this place.

396
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,699
MALORY: Damn it!

397
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,567
I have to pay for these rooms.

398
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:52,301
CHERYL/CAROL: Well?!

399
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,503
LANA: Well what?!

400
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,540
ARCHER: Why do I feel like -- no, why
do I know that we've done this before!

401
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:01,010
LANA: I, uh, we haven't, um--
ARCHER: Yes we have, Lana!

402
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,874
Throwing bottle bombs, your tits
flopping around...

403
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,850
LANA: Flopping?! Okay, first of all --
ARCHER: Oh my God, what's happening?!

404
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,015
It feels like my brain is exploding!

405
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,237
LANA: Krieger, what's happening?!

406
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:15,736
KRIEGER: His mind-brain is permanently
rejecting his real identity!

407
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:16,792
CYRIL: Mind-brain?

408
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,064
KRIEGER: That's a thing, shut up.

409
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,299
Uh, Lana?!

410
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:19,990
ARCHER: Linda!

411
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,854
LANA: Linda?

412
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:22,472
ARCHER: You're my wife!
Linda!

413
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,113
And I am Bob!

414
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,422
I am Bob and I make burgers!

415
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,678
KGB AGENT: On liubit burgery...
KGB AGENT 2: Eto yego problema.

416
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:33,339
ARCHER: Burger Bob, Bob
Bob burger burger...

417
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,715
KGB AGENT: Dosvidaniya, Archer...

418
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,932
LANA: Bob, honey, I need you to get down!

419
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:42,742
ARCHER: Yes, down to
the store for cheese!

420
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,856
For the Émile Gorgonzola Burger!

421
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,375
LANA: Okay, I have had it.

422
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:49,008
ARCHER: Well, not with j'accuse-cumbers!

423
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,280
KGB AGENT: Ogon'!

424
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,423
ARCHER: Oww!

425
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:56,572
What the shit, Lana?!

426
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:57,424
LANA: Archer?

427
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,359
Wait, are you... you?

428
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,427
ARCHER: Yes, I'm me!

429
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,528
You dumb idiot!

430
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:03,630
KRIEGER: There goes the
frying pan theory.

431
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,165
ARCHER: Who did you think I was?!

432
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,435
LANA: You, unfortunately...
ARCHER: Unfortunately?!

433
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,371
What's unfortunate is you got
me into a firefight with the

434
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,377
KGB armed with a frickin cap gun!

435
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:20,146
LANA: Because unfortunately,
we were trying to cure your --

436
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:22,148
ARCHER: Psychogenic retrograde amnesia!

437
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:25,751
Duh!

438
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,055
LANA: Wait, so you
remember you had amnesia?

439
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:32,458
KRIEGER: Such a fragile mystery...
LANA: Krieger, one more word and

440
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,595
I'll make you wish they never scraped
you out of Hitler's drawers.

441
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,162
KRIEGER: Aww...
CYRIL: Ew.

442
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,330
ARCHER: Ew.

443
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:40,232
That is a lot creamier than I remembered.

444
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,101
LANA: But, you do remember why you
ran away from home this time?

445
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,071
ARCHER: I'm a grown man, Lana,
I didn't run away from home!

446
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,641
I... carjacked a limo.

447
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,276
From a wedding.

448
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,130
Oh my God, it's all
coming back to me now...

449
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,914
What part of this

450
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,949
are you not getting?!

451
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:57,978
CHAUFFEUR: Core concept?

452
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:02,722
ARCHER: Drive, shitheel!

453
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,590
MALORY: Wh-?!

454
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:04,791
Where is the limo going?!

455
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,426
CHERYL/CAROL: I guess
wherever Mr. Archer said to.

456
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,095
MALORY: Son of a bitch!

457
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:09,962
PAM: Your words.

458
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,765
CYRIL: Burn.

459
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,000
MALORY: Ruined!

460
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,769
Absolutely ruined, because of you!

461
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,371
ARCHER: I said I was sorry, Mother!

462
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,873
MALORY: Happiest day of my life...
ARCHER: Wait, wasn't that the

463
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:21,607
day I was born?

464
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:22,809
Oww!

465
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:23,676
What's in there?

466
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,611
Spa buckles?

467
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,515
MALORY: You think that compares to a dream
wedding to Ron Cadillac, the biggest

468
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:30,317
Cadillac dealer in New York?!

469
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:32,386
RON: Technically the
whole tri-state area!

470
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,621
EVERYBODY: [ Cheers ]

471
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,556
RON: Hiya, gang!

472
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,791
MALORY: Oh, Ron!

473
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,726
Thank you for coming so quickly!

474
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:39,794
PAM: Phrasing, first, boom!

475
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:43,031
RON: Well, in a Cadillac you don't
have to sacrifice speed for luxury.

476
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,634
That baby'll pass anything on the road...
except a gas station!

477
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:50,038
EVERYBODY: [genuine laughter]

478
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,227
RON: And how's my lady love?

479
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:52,807
MALORY: Infinitely better now.

480
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,276
RON: I bet, now that you found Sterling!

481
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,512
She was just worried sick about you.

482
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:00,415
MALORY: Well, not sick...
RON: How the heck are ya, son?

483
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:04,619
ARCHER: Fine, awful, whatever, great...
MALORY: But mostly mortified

484
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,020
that he ruined our wedding!

485
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:09,224
RON: Well... all's well that ends well.

486
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:12,126
LANA: Yeah, I don't
think it does, though.

487
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:13,061
ARCHER: No shit.

488
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:15,963
LANA: No, I mean, the KGB found
you at a burger joint when you

489
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:18,900
didn't even know who you were,
then they found you here?

490
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,167
How did they do that?

491
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:24,271
ARCHER: I -- wait, yeah,
how'd they do that?

492
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,511
BARRY: Barry, are we losing our minds?

493
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,481
BARRY: Could be, Other Barry, could be...
Because even though

494
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,284
I can see Archer's every
frickin move, apparently it's

495
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:40,554
impossible to kill that
idiot from frickin space!

496
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:44,658
So where are we on the frickin
spaceship to get me home?!

497
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,167
And I'm lookin' your way, Dr. Simon.

498
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,496
SCIENTIST: Uh, well...
BARRY: Lemme stop ya right

499
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,232
there, in case you were about
to say there's been a setback.

500
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,968
Because that's what Dr. Benes
and Dr. Hathaway kept saying.

501
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:55,470
Remember those guys?

502
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,850
They were workin' with you
guys on my new spaceship?

503
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,577
I murdered them?

504
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,116
ARCHER: Eh, probably just a coincidence.

505
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:04,850
LANA: Really.

506
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,119
You're going with coincidence.

507
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,621
ARCHER: Yes, Lana, I'm
going with coincidence!

508
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,357
OSTRICH: Do you think that's wise?

509
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:14,126
CHERYL/CAROL: [ screaming ]

510
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,435
ARCHER: What the hell is your problem?!

511
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:24,882
