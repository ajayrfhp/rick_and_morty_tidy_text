1
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,720
PAM: Aw c'maaaahn!

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:08,255
Clock yer skinny ass out already, and
let's go get outside some dranks!

3
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,423
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh, I can't!

4
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:12,459
I have to cover her stupid
phone in case those stupid

5
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,131
pirates call with a stupid ransom
demand for Mr. Stupid Archer!

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,831
MALORY: Carol?!

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,466
Carol! Have they called?!

8
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,803
CHERYL/CAROL: No! Ma'am!

9
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,639
But rest assured I'll let you
know the minute they dooo!

10
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,340
MALORY: Rest?

11
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:29,311
My God, who can rest...
CHERYL/CAROL: Not me, apparently.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,079
CYRIL: Or me!

13
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:33,348
I have to re-do the annual
budget because she's blowing it

14
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:35,717
all on this so-called
rescue of Archer!

15
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,919
PAM: Well his plane did crash,
and the distress signal was last

16
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,722
heard coming from a known pirate
fortress, so... CYRIL: So?!

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,258
That doesn't mean Ray and Lana have
to bankrupt ISIS getting there!

18
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:47,859
GILLETTE: Oh, would you relax?

19
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,594
You rent a boat,
that money's gone.

20
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,763
This way, we can sell
it when we're done.

21
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,997
I bet it'll come out cheaper.

22
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,000
LANA: I wasn't talking
about the boat.

23
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,502
GILLETTE: I think five grand
for the week was a steal.

24
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,838
Look at him, he is lithe.

25
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:03,743
LANA: So a twink escort your rent, but -- 
GILLETTE: That's different!

26
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,413
I mean, they did ask if I wanted to
actually buy him, but I thought...

27
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:08,915
LANA: What, that I'd
be weird about it?

28
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,684
GILLETTE: I -- LANA: That I, perhaps
due to my race, might have a problem

29
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,020
with the concept of
owning a human being?

30
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,456
GILLETTE: I actually just
thought I'd get tired of him.

31
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:16,922
LANA: You?

32
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:18,791
Mr. Can't Even Commit To A Pet?

33
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,492
GILLETTE: Wh-?

34
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:20,460
Yeah hi, two cats!

35
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:24,663
One of whom I think has FIP, so...
commit that.

36
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:26,932
CYRIL: You know how hard I
worked on this budget?!

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,202
Nights, weekends, canceled my
vacation, and now it's all wasted!

38
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,139
PAM: Wasted, exactly,
let's go be that!

39
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:38,610
C'mon, happy hour at
Pita Margarita's!

40
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,846
CHERYL/CAROL: Is...
that what it sounds like?

41
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:44,182
PAM: Only if it sounds like a shitload
of tequila and some A-rab hoagies.

42
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,751
MALORY: How dare you?!

43
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,819
PAM: Arab, sorry.

44
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:49,321
MALORY: Oh shut up, how can you
even think about happy hour

45
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,791
at a time like this?!

46
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,297
When probably as we speak, my poor
Sterling is being tortured by pirates!

47
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,765
CYRIL: I wish... MALORY: What?!

48
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,234
CYRIL: Wish you
wouldn't say that!

49
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:07,341
Because I'm sure he's not being tortured...
ARCHER: Aaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhh!

50
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,646
Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop,
seriously I can't take anymore!

51
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:18,352
Whew! That was insane, I never
even heard of that position!

52
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,488
Did the missionaries not
swing by here, or...?

53
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:21,088
NOAH: Excuse me?

54
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:22,623
Sorry, pirate-king Archer?

55
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,057
ARCHER: What! Noah!

56
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,560
NOAH: Ready for the
uh, morning briefing?

57
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:32,199
ARCHER: Noah, I'm half drunk and slathered in...
every bodily fluid there is.

58
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:34,668
So yeah, this is about as
piratekingy as I'm gonna get.

59
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,402
Brief away!

60
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,471
NOAH: Okay, item one! The -- 
ARCHER: Noah.

61
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,039
NOAH: Yes sir?

62
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,049
ARCHER: Good morning.

63
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:51,840
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

64
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,327
NOAH: O.K. Item one.

65
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:20,962
The huge morale problem.

66
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,464
ARCHER: How do we have
a morale problem?

67
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,733
NOAH: Well first of all -- 
ARCHER: C'mon, karaoke night's a big hit...

68
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:31,938
PIRATE: Roti dan mentega,
bakar dan selai!

69
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,640
ARCHER: Woooo!

70
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,778
We have an awesome feast every night...
Woooo!

71
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:42,682
Not to mention
intramural lacrosse!

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,751
Woooo!

73
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,119
Woooo!

74
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,555
Woooo!

75
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,190
So how can they have low morale?

76
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,527
NOAH: Well um, besides all of those
things, they haven't been paid.

77
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,797
ARCHER: So pay 'em, what do you
need, new payroll software?

78
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,565
Cyril always handled
all that stuff.

79
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:01,770
Payroll, budgets, he's a genius at that crap...
CYRIL: Just find the money,

80
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,871
Cyril!

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,307
You're an accounting
genius, Cyril!

82
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,543
That's right you bitch.

83
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:08,110
I said it.

84
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:12,280
So good luck finding all
these Swiss accounts!

85
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,950
Mwah ha!
Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa!

86
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,951
PAM: Whatcha doin?

87
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,052
CYRIL: Aagh!

88
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,524
Hey, Pam... NOAH: No, we don't need --
ARCHER: Oh! And dealing with

89
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:26,228
disgruntled employees, Pam's great at that...
PAM: Izzat innernet porn?

90
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,395
CYRIL: Uh, yep!

91
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:30,232
Just, um... just jackin it.

92
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:33,402
PAM: Can I watch?

93
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,870
Or izzat weird?

94
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,540
CYRIL: It's... kinda weird.

95
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:40,143
PAM: Is it?

96
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,379
CYRIL: Yes.

97
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,014
ARCHER: I think it's because
she's such a good listener.

98
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:44,915
NOAH: And she sounds lovely.

99
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,986
But you don't need an HR rep and payroll
software -- ARCHER: Couldn't hurt...

100
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,887
NOAH: Sir! Please!

101
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,089
Pirates work for shares, and
since you became pirateking

102
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,592
there hasn't been any booty, so --
ARCHER: Gonna have to go ahead

103
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,226
and disagree with
you there, buddy.

104
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,561
NOAH: From pirated ships.

105
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:58,961
ARCHER: Oh.

106
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,630
I thought you meant from the --
NOAH: Native girls, no.

107
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,767
ARCHER: Sorry, I don't know
all the pirate terms yet.

108
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,369
NOAH: Well -- 
ARCHER: I'm new! To all of this!

109
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:12,208
Especially the actual,
you know, piracy part...

110
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,043
It's not really what I expected.

111
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,546
Dammit, I said get over there!

112
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,050
For the jillionth time,
nobody is raping anybody!

113
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,152
Actually no, you know what?!

114
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,455
Now nobody gets anything,
because I'm letting him go!

115
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,356
[ Grumbling ]

116
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:25,856
Shut up!

117
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,324
He's a small business owner!

118
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,927
If he loses his ship
he'll be ruined!

119
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:30,961
You can go.

120
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,397
Ooh, but can we get about
fifty pounds of tuna steaks?

121
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,833
NOAH: Which you let him
talk you down to twenty.

122
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,300
ARCHER: Well?!

123
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,235
You know what kinda margins
those guys work on?

124
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,604
NOAH: I actually don't...
ARCHER: Well nice Ph.D.!

125
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,339
NOAH: My field's anthropology.

126
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,742
And I'm actually just
a doctoral candidate?

127
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,246
Or I was, until these guys captured
my research vessel and enslaved me...

128
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,249
ARCHER: Ugh, not this again...
NOAH: So I was thinking, if you freed me...

129
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,918
ARCHER: You're my
translator, I need you.

130
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,420
That's why I made
you first mate.

131
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,388
NOAH: Which also went
over pretty badly.

132
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,958
ARCHER: Yeah, people hate you
so let's just put a pin in the

133
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,893
whole... manumission thing.

134
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,294
NOAH: But -- 
ARCHER: Noah!

135
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,295
Morale's low enough as it is.

136
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,665
And I bet I know who's to blame!

137
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:10,402
NOAH: No kidding... RILEY: I'm not
kidding, this Archer guy's gonna get you

138
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,105
all killed. He -- 
ARCHER: Riley!

139
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,673
RILEY: Archer, what
a coincidence.

140
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,908
I was just talking about you.

141
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:16,508
ARCHER: With who?

142
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,577
Cause that bucktooth little shit
doesn't even speak English!

143
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,379
BUCKY: I do little bit --
RCHER: No you don't.

144
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:24,617
BUCKY: -- and correct
syntax is "with whom!"

145
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:27,754
NOAH: Man, that is not
gonna help morale.

146
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,990
RILEY: Yeah, Bucky's an
incorrigible gossip.

147
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,893
ARCHER: Who -- to whom you
are forbidden to speak!

148
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,862
I locked you down here so you
couldn't contact my mother,

149
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,365
not so you could,
whatever, sow disharmony!

150
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,801
RILEY: You're sowing
plenty all by yourself.

151
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,170
Face it kid, you're a
bust as a pirateking.

152
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,738
ARCHER: King, exactly!

153
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,874
And unless you want to spend
the rest of the afternoon with

154
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:48,676
a bunch of scorpions,
don't forget it!

155
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:51,145
MALORY: And remember,
this is a rescue mission.

156
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:51,879
LANA: I heard you.

157
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:55,482
MALORY: So don't charge in there all
crazy, machine-gunning everything

158
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,016
in sight.

159
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,484
LANA: When have I -- 
MALORY: I'm sure you'd love it

160
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:01,988
if Sterling were killed in some huge crossfire.
LANA: Wh-? No I wouldn't!

161
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,023
MALORY: -- but just try to
control all your jealousy and,

162
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:08,194
ick, sexual frustration.

163
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,029
LANA: Oh no, you're breaking up.

164
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,363
MALORY: Lana.

165
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,867
LANA: I mean, am I jealous because
Archer gets preferential treatment?

166
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:15,201
Yes.

167
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,203
But am I still attracted to him?

168
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,173
GILLETTE: Is a pig's ass pork?

169
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:25,612
I'm sorry, did you wanna hear what I
think, or just what you wanna hear?

170
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,865
He asked, pretty sarcastically.

171
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,234
BUCKY: Raja lemah!

172
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:36,002
Raja lemah!

173
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,805
BUCKY: Kita
memerlukan raja baru!

174
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:39,672
ARCHER: Whoa whoa!

175
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,840
Bucky! What is this?!

176
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,276
BUCKY: We hold
erections for king!

177
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:47,615
ARCHER: Well, flattering, not really necessary...
NOAH: He means elections.

178
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,450
ARCHER: Okay, that makes
more -- wait, what?!

179
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,252
BUCKY: Time for new king!

180
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,386
Raja baru!

181
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:53,621
PIRATES: [ grumblings ]

182
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,823
ARCHER: Okay, pirates!

183
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,124
Hey! Take a knee!

184
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:56,958
Noah You wanna...?

185
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,159
NOAH: That won't translate.

186
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,598
It's like last week when you said "lend
me your ears" and they were like "Apa?"

187
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,466
ARCHER: Damn it -- 
NOAH: I can't do idioms.

188
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,735
ARCHER: Shut up.

189
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:10,673
Then unshut up, and tell them I understand
their frustration... NOAH: Do you?

190
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,441
Saya mendengar anda!

191
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,245
ARCHER: But you don't change horses in mid -- 
NOAH: Idiom!

192
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,114
ARCHER: Now is not the
time for a new king!

193
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:22,351
NOAH: Sekarang tidak
ada raja baru!

194
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,219
ARCHER: Because the
king is strong!

195
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,188
NOAH: Raja yang kuat!

196
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,424
BUCKY: If you so strong...
melawan raja!

197
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:30,425
PIRATES: Yah!

198
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:31,193
Melawan raja!

199
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:31,960
Melawan raja!

200
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,429
ARCHER: What's melawan raja?

201
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:34,363
NOAH: King-fight.

202
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:38,133
If the king loses to a challenger in
one-on-one combat, he has to step down.

203
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,367
Or just be dead.

204
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,168
ARCHER: Since when?!

205
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,237
NOAH: Since 19... always.

206
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,906
Did you not read the
orientation materials?

207
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,710
ARCHER: Woooo!

208
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,312
Mmmmore skimmed it?

209
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,647
BUCKY: Enough talk!

210
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:52,915
Melawan raja!

211
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:57,353
ARCHER: Okay Bucky, we'll melawan raja...
NOAH: Oh, one thing --

212
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,021
ARCHER: Noah shut
up and translate.

213
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,491
I accept your challenge!

214
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,293
NOAH: Cabaran diterima!

215
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:07,230
ARCHER: Because your mouth's been
writing checks your butt can't cash,

216
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:11,034
NOAH: Anda -- Do you even
know what an idiom is?

217
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,369
ARCHER: Colloquial metaphor.

218
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:16,040
NOAH: No, it's -- well actually yes, but
I really think this is a bad idea --

219
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,776
ARCHER: I'm not remunerating
you to think, Noah!

220
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,044
Even if you weren't a slave.

221
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:27,919
And your three-fifths of an opinion
is noted, so -- oh sweet Jesus Jones!

222
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:30,488
NOAH: See, Bucky doesn't
have to fight you himself.

223
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:31,723
He can choose a stand-in.

224
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,258
ARCHER: Who is... huge!

225
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,995
NOAH: That's what I was --
ARCHER: Why didn't he come out for lacrosse?!

226
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,397
BUCKY: You lucky
I don't let him!

227
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,065
ARCHER: Let him?

228
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,601
NOAH: He's Bucky's girlfriend.

229
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,304
ARCHER: Way to eschew traditional
gender roles, pirates.

230
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:50,574
NOAH: Yeah, they're fascinating...
BUCKY: Now we melawan raja!

231
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:53,411
And then we see who is
bucktooth little shit!

232
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,112
ARCHER: It'll still be you.

233
00:09:55,181 --> 00:10:00,584
Listen --
BUCKY: Melawaaaaaaan rajaaaaa!

234
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,586
PIRATES: Mela-wan, ra-ja!

235
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:03,187
Mela-wan, ra-ja!

236
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:05,255
ARCHER: Hey, maybe there's a way
to make some money on this.

237
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:05,989
Bet on me.

238
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,760
NOAH: I would, but who'd bet on --
wait, don't you have that backwards?

239
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:10,294
LANA: No.

240
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:12,029
Because you know what I bet?

241
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:14,999
GILLETTE: I bet I kn you're gonna tell me...
LANA: I bet after we Zodiac in

242
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:18,536
past the reef, take out at least one O.
P., make our way through a jungle

243
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:21,941
full of Claymores, neutralize the fortress
garrison, and finally extract that

244
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,279
kidnapped-gettin ass sonuvabitch, he's
gonna be all like -- ARCHER: Woooooo!

245
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,881
LANA: Wuhhhhh!

246
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,019
Like this whole thing was all just part of some...
dumbshit master plan.

247
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,520
GILLETTE: She said, trying
to convince herself that

248
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,223
she no longer ached
for his -- Oww!

249
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,592
LANA: I'm sorry, what
were you gonna say?

250
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,526
GILLETTE: Cock.

251
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,594
ARCHER: Suck it!

252
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:43,097
Cause I'm still the king!

253
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:43,797
BUCKY: This no fair!

254
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:44,865
You break the rules!

255
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:45,966
ARCHER: What rules?!

256
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:46,834
We're pirates!

257
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:50,471
BUCKY: Melawan raja
mean hand-hand combat!

258
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,939
ARCHER: Boo-hoo, show me!

259
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:55,409
Show me where it says that!

260
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,311
Take your time. I'm hourly.

261
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,649
BUCKY: I know it in here somewhere...
Damn! Okay, maybe it don't say

262
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:07,421
this exact words, but everybody know --
ARCHER: Nooop!

263
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,791
Fair is -- well it wasn't exactly
fair, but since it wasn't expressly

264
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,794
forbidden... tough titties!

265
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:16,530
Wow, I never realized how
much we rely idioms.

266
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,898
BUCKY: You win this
round, Archer!

267
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:19,465
ARCHER: Duh.

268
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,534
BUCKY: But every
dog has its day!

269
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:22,769
ARCHER: See? Idiom.

270
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:25,739
BUCKY: And when that day
come Bucky make you sorry!

271
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,909
- Bucky make you say -- 
- Mayday mayday mayday...This is Rip Riley

272
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,644
calling ISIS, over.

273
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:32,278
ARCHER: Noah.

274
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,112
NOAH: That's not me.

275
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,179
ARCHER: I know that!

276
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:36,448
RILEY: Damn it, is that the P.
A.?!

277
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,916
Way to eschew traditional
labeling, pirates.

278
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:39,584
ARCHER: Fascinating.

279
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,353
Because since when is there a
radio in the damn dungeon?!

280
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:46,389
NOAH: God, you really shoulda
read your orientation materials.

281
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,090
ARCHER: Noah!

282
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,159
NOAH: Radio room!

283
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:53,930
RILEY: Mayday mayday mayday,
this is Rip Riley calling ISIS.

284
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,866
Mayday may -- 
MALORY: Rip?!

285
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:58,769
RILEY: Finally. Malory, listen to me very -- 
MALORY: How's Sterling,

286
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:02,673
is he hurt or -- oh God, have
the pirates tortured him?!

287
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:03,641
RILEY: Uh, no.

288
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,112
MALORY: Oh thank God, I was --
wait, are you under duress?!

289
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,582
If you are, key
your handset twice!

290
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,119
RILEY: I'm not under duress, I'm --
MALORY: Well, that's exactly

291
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,422
what you'd say if you were under duress, so --
RILEY: Malory!

292
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,258
I don't have a lot of time, so
please listen very carefully...

293
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,293
MALORY: I'm listening!

294
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,196
RILEY: Your son, is--
ARCHER: Nooo!

295
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,198
[ BLAM! ]

296
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:26,166
MALORY: Oh my -- Carol!
Somebody?!

297
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:26,967
CHERYL/CAROL: What.

298
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,970
MALORY: Sterling... I think...
he's been shot!

299
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,273
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God.

300
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:33,774
So then can I go home?

301
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,010
ARCHER: I told you, I'm
not going anywhere!

302
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,348
Especially not back to ISIS, and especially
not now that I just shot -- What I

303
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,984
assume was the only radio?

304
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:46,588
NOAH: Yeah, "See about getting a
back-up radio" was itemmmmm five.

305
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:50,091
ARCHER: And item one, is Riley
get your ass back in your cell!

306
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,761
NOAH: Item one's actually
the morale problem.

307
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,362
ARCHER: Noah?

308
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,130
RILEY: More like
potential mutiny.

309
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,165
NOAH: Yeah, right?

310
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,667
Gonna go ahead and
change "morale problem"

311
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,102
to "potential mutiny"...
ARCHER: No! You're not!

312
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:05,807
Because there is no mutiny, potential
or otherwi -- BUCKY: Pemberontakan!

313
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:07,943
PIRATES: Pemberontakan!

314
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,512
ARCHER: So, is that Malay for --
NOAH: Mutiny, yes.

315
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,750
So I guess I should upgrade it from
"potential" to -- RILEY: Incipient?

316
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,251
NOAH: Ooh, nice... 
ARCHER: No!

317
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,954
Do not upgrade that mutiny, Noah!
I will tell you!

318
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:20,988
When it's time!

319
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:28,596
To upgrade the damn -- Mutiny, okay, so...
What comes after incipient?

320
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:29,530
RILEY: In progress?

321
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,489
NOAH: Nailed it!

322
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:40,952
Oh, this is great.
This is just great for my ears.

323
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,239
ARCHER: This is what I was talking
about, with the whole tinnitis thing!

324
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:48,911
You hear that high-pitched whine?
It's like NOAH: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

325
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,613
ARCHER: Noah!

326
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:51,914
NOAH: Aagh! What?!

327
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:55,818
ARCHER: I -- well for one thing, I'm
kinda regretting making you first mate!

328
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:56,518
NOAH: Me too!

329
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,721
Now I'm... management!

330
00:13:58,789 --> 00:13:59,454
RILEY: Archer!

331
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,122
ARCHER: What?!

332
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,289
RILEY: Shut up! Noah!

333
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:01,857
NOAH: What?!

334
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,859
RILEY: What'd you say
about a back-up radio?!

335
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,561
NOAH: That we need one!

336
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,429
It's itemmmm... Five!

337
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:11,868
RILEY: Oh well that's just--
ARCHER: A battering ram?

338
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:16,939
BUCKY: Archer! Kami membunuhmu!

339
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,308
ARCHER: What was
that, what'd he say?

340
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,544
NOAH: "We're going to kill you."

341
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:20,978
ARCHER: Oh.

342
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,346
Thought they were surrendering.

343
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:23,180
RILEY: Why?!

344
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:24,714
Would you think that?!

345
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:25,816
ARCHER: They did before!

346
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:26,883
For no good reason!

347
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,819
RILEY: At least then we
had assault weapons!

348
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,121
Now we've only got -- give me that!

349
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,289
ARCHER: Yeah go nuts,
Sundance, it's empty.

350
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:34,090
RILEY: It's empty!

351
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,057
Because you emptied it!

352
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,426
Into the only radio
on the island!

353
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,396
ARCHER: All six, right in the ten ring...
RILEY: Well, congratulations!

354
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:41,063
We're trapped!

355
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,933
ARCHER: We're not -- Trapped.

356
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:46,002
Okay yeah, we're trapped.

357
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,606
NOAH: Uh, heah gang...
why don't we just use that?

358
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:54,812
ARCHER: Well obviously
we're gonna use that.

359
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:56,481
PIRATES: Hantu!

360
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,917
BUCKY: They not ghosts!

361
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,352
They just white!

362
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,553
PIRATE: Rasis.

363
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:03,521
BUCKY: You're racist!

364
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,490
MALORY: Those dirty
pirate bastards!

365
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,093
They killed my baby
boy-hoy-hooyyy!

366
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,530
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh now, you don't know that for sure...
MALORY: You're right!

367
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,365
That sound could've
been anything!

368
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:17,000
Like... a firecracker!

369
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,302
Orientals are crazy
for firecrackers!

370
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,036
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh
my God, and rice?

371
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,372
MALORY: Or maybe Rip shot a
pirate, and Sterling yelled

372
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:26,042
"No" because he didn't want
to give away their position!

373
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:27,043
CHERYL/CAROL: And opium.

374
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:29,113
MALORY: Yes, you know,
I bet they've escaped!

375
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,547
CHERYL/CAROL: oh my God...
and rice.

376
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,550
MALORY: Because if anyone can
escape from a pirate fortress,

377
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,085
it's Sterling and Rip.

378
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:36,621
Especially if they cooperate.

379
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,357
RILEY: Damn it, quit stepping
on my hands, you idiot!

380
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:39,658
ARCHER: Quit bossing me around!

381
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,795
You're not my -- wait, tell me
there's no chance you're my father.

382
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,331
RILEY: Not unless
you're -- Fifteen.

383
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,098
ARCHER: Thank God.

384
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,500
RILEY: The feeling's mutual.

385
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:51,703
Because if my son was as big a bonehead
as you -- ARCHER: You have a son?

386
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,138
RILEY: Wh-? No.

387
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,072
ARCHER: Then shut up. Noah!

388
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:55,840
Where the hell does this go?!

389
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,341
NOAH: I don't know, down!

390
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,912
ARCHER: Wow, you're only a doctoral candidate...
NOAH: Hey guy, my field's

391
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,679
anthropology!

392
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,714
RILEY: Good luck
with the job hunt.

393
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:04,314
ARCHER: Right?

394
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,985
NOAH: Not that it's any of your
business, but I plan to teach?!

395
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,186
ARCHER: Anthropology.

396
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:08,820
NOAH: Wh-? Yes!

397
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,422
RILEY: To anthropology majors.

398
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,556
NOAH: Hey ya know what?

399
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,692
ARCHER: Thus continuing
the circle of why bother.

400
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:18,131
NOAH: Anthropology is an
important field of study!

401
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,501
ARCHER: I'm pretty sure somebody's
already named all the different spiders!

402
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,736
NOAH: Wh-? That's arachnology!

403
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:24,537
ARCHER: I know!

404
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,706
Equally huge waste of time!

405
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,308
NOAH: Hey speaking of,
can we go back up?

406
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:32,077
ARCHER: Oh my God.

407
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:33,545
Not really.

408
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,213
Why?

409
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,981
NOAH: Just curious.

410
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,716
ARCHER: Go go go go go!

411
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:38,651
RILEY: Waaaagh!

412
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:41,854
ARCHER: Waaaagh!

413
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:52,864
Oh, shi -- That was just
a flash-bang grenade!

414
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,167
Still super-bad for your ears,
So when we get outta here,

415
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:59,437
you should go see my
ENT doctor, he's good.

416
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,840
RILEY: How the hell are we
supposed to get out of here?!

417
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,074
ARCHER: Isn't this your cell?

418
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:03,675
RILEY: Yes!

419
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,110
ARCHER: So how'd you
get out before?

420
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,244
RILEY: I bribed Bucky!

421
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,345
ARCHER: Noah!

422
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:07,779
NOAH: What?

423
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,881
ARCHER: That is
annoying as shit!

424
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,351
And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again,
since I crippled his girlfriend...

425
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,587
RILEY: So what're we
supposed to ow?!

426
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:17,589
ARCHER: I dunno.

427
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,523
MALORY: But I may as
well go home and rest.

428
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:22,527
If they haven't escaped already,
Lana will be there any time now,

429
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:23,961
and she'll get them out.

430
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,130
And it's not like I can do anything from here...
CHERYL/CAROL: Exactly!

431
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,298
So why do I have to stay?!

432
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,167
MALORY: Because Lana may call.

433
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,102
Or because I said so.

434
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,638
Pick one.

435
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:39,676
CYRIL: Who's jackin' it?

436
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:41,511
MALORY: And why the hell
are you still here?

437
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,949
CYRIL: I, um, this is,
uh, what was I doing?

438
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,584
MALORY: Whatever it was, you
better pray it had about

439
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:49,587
three coats of Scotch-Gard.

440
00:17:49,655 --> 00:18:02,101
CYRIL: And that it wasn't, ick, Pam...
LANA: His narrow twinky ass

441
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,770
better not steal the boat, is all I'm saying...
Oh! And just,

442
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,807
before we get in there, I am
not still attracted to Archer!

443
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:12,512
I'm sure he's still attracted to me,
I mean, he'd have to be Uh, blind...

444
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:16,282
not to, um...
I am so sorry about that.

445
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,617
Does it hurt?

446
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:21,220
Ray, seriously, I'm sorry.

447
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,021
Oh, now you're giving me
the silent treatment?!

448
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,591
What're you, six?!

449
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,528
GILLETTE: No...
Just professional.

450
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,865
Hey, pirates...
ARCHER: Okay, then how 'bout this?

451
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:33,768
We set Noah on fire--
NOAH: What?

452
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,696
ARCHER: -- and when they come to
put him out, we overpower them.

453
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:37,870
We don't have a lighter.

454
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,762
Well, then, I'm out of ideas.

455
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,425
And also, out of ***.

456
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:45,868
Because no rescue for you, hotshot.

457
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,292
- We catch your friends on beachy.
- But...

458
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,677
Ray? Holy shit, wheredcha...

459
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,139
get that eye-patch?

460
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,954
What are you, in pirate disguise?

00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,977
Great job, buddy.
Looks great.

462
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,191
Lana?

463
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,934
You came all this way?
To rescue me?

464
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,692
Oh, my God.

465
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:03,878
Archer, don't.

466
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,096
Still got it pretty bad for me, huh?

467
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,403
Archer...

468
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:12,470
- Archer... Archer, don't you dare say...
- Whoo!
