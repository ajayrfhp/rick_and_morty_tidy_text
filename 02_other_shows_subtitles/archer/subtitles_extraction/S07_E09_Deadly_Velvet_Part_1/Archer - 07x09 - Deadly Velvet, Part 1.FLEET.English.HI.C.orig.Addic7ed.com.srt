1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,250
[Malory] Now, then, Mr. Crane,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,000
tell us what the Archer
Agency can do for you.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,600
- Well, I...
- Excuse me.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,425
It's the Figgis Agency.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,925
Cyril, please!
Stop interrupting.

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,775
Now, Mr. Crane,
how can we help you?

7
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:18,675
Well, I'm afraid that someone,
or someones,

8
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:21,600
is trying to sabotage my latest
picture, <i>Deadly Velvet.</i>

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,100
[door opens, shoes scuffle]

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,775
[chuckling] You mean
besides the critics?

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,100
Huh? We're still in production.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,675
It's a joke.
Lighten up, Fritz Lang.

13
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,825
[clears throat]

14
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,150
And what makes you
suspect sabotage?

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,275
Well, as Lana can confirm...

16
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:37,625
Oh-ho-ho, so now it's "Lana"?

17
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,850
Uh, Miss Kane, rather,
who, as you know,

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,475
has recently begun working

19
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,950
on the picture as a
technical advisor.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,700
There's already been
three accidents on-set

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,325
which were pretty suspicious.

22
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,325
A fire,
a camera crane collapsed...

23
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,200
Narrowly missing
several crew members.

24
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,200
And yesterday, there was
some kind of malfunction

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,475
with a stuntman's airbag.

26
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,000
That poor devil
may be paralyzed.

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,350
Well,
it certainly sounds suspicious.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,050
But why come to us?
Why not the police?

29
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,475
- I...
- I don't know, Cyril.

30
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,025
Maybe he wanted to be
interrupted every five seconds.

31
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:08,650
I don't, actually.

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,325
And Ellis doesn't want
the police involved.

33
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,150
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
So now it's "Ellis"?

34
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Yes, Archer.
It's Ellis. And Lana.

35
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,150
He and I are on a
first-name basis,

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,350
whereas you and
I are on a break!

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,225
Yeah, how you holdin' up?

38
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:22,375
- Pff.
- I'll take that as a "barely."

39
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,900
Take it however you want.

40
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,200
Already did, so...

41
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,375
- Could we...
- Cyril, I swear to God...

42
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,600
Malory!
Ellis wants to hire the agency

43
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,950
to go undercover on the set.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,125
[gasps] Ooh.

45
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,850
You could pose as
technical advisor.

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,350
I already am.

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,675
- Posing.
- The technical advisor.

48
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:39,800
And if someone is trying
to sabotage the movie,

49
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,575
- our job is to catch them.
- Discreetly.

50
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,525
If the insurance company
pulls the bond or, God forbid,

51
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,525
my investors back out,
I'll be ruined!

52
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,725
Don't worry, Mr. Crane.
We won't let that happen.

53
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:52,050
Put your faith in us.

54
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,725
[groans] I'm afraid I must.

55
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,400
We'll see you there
this afternoon.

56
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,575
Ellis,
should we get back to the set?

57
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,550
Meh?
Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh?

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,050
[sighs]

59
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,775
- And, uh, how are you holding up?
- Pff.

60
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,575
All right, listen up.

61
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,225
As much as I hate,
hate, hate, hate...

62
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,750
to do this, a movie set is huge,

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,550
so we're going to need all of
you to go undercover, so...

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,550
- Yay!
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,300
[groans] So try to act
like professionals.

66
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,100
Professional whats?
What do we have to do, more work?

67
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,350
Well, I've tried to match the
various production departments

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,550
to your skill sets,
such as they are,

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,250
so Cyril... accounting.
Get into those books.

70
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,900
Find out who could
benefit from cost overruns

71
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,750
or delays in production.

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,575
And that is exactly what I was
going to tell myself to do, so...

73
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,975
Pam... craft services.

74
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,275
Goddamn it.

75
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,475
Wh...
I'm the one who knows macramé.

76
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,950
And you're also
babysitting Carol.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,150
Wh...
Why do I need a babysitter?

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,950
Because they've
already had one fire.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,150
[sighs] Then why not
just leave her here?

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,625
Because we've
already had one fire.

81
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,300
Now, then, Gillette...

82

Ooh, what about me?

Oh,

Oh, I will.

90
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,450
And I shall pose as
an executive producer,

91
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,325
which leaves Sterling.

92
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,325
Yeah, it leaves him right here
'cause I'll be damned

00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:11,875
Veronica Deane.

162
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,850
Yes? Oh, hello, Alan.

163
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,800
Wait. That's why you're here?

164
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,350
Yeah, Crane hired us.

165
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,525
It's nice to see you again,
Ms. Deane.

166
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:21,975
I'm sorry. Have we met?

167
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,525
Oh, um, yeah.

168
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,675
I'm Sterling Archer,
private investigator.

169
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,800
You hired me.

170
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,200
Um, and then another time,

171
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,150
I protected you in
a hostage situation,

172
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,550
dressed as a clown.

173
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,550
- Is this not ringing any...
- Alan?

174
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,875
Apparently Ellis hired him to
protect you during the shoot.

175
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:41,325
Other than my ex-husband's refusal
to let me get on with my life,

176
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,600
the only thing I need protection
from is this clunky dialogue.

177
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,850
Thought I had a joke, but...

178
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr... Archer, was it?

179
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah. We actually even kissed.

180
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,025
I'm sorry you've wasted your
time, but I can assure you

181
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,825
I have absolutely no need
for a bodyguard, so...

182
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,875
- [man] Look out!
- [gasps]

183
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,575
[people gasping, yelling]

184
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,375
You were saying?

185
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:12,175
[sighs]

186
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,800
[chuckling] Yeah, you were.

187
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,725
[man] Move those cans. Now!

188
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,300
Don't you break my cables!
Come on, people!

189
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,500
Move the cables! Careful!

190
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,475
Oh, for God's sakes, what now?

191
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,600
Looks like a runaway forklift.

192
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,600
[groaning] That, and I'm pretty
sure my ribs are shattered.

193
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,500
- Like breadsticks.
- Move those lights, you fools!

194
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,650
Oh,
we're just hemorrhaging money.

195
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,825
- And speaking of hemorrhaging...
- What in the hell happened?

196
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,475
- A forklift.
- And a forkwad.

197
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,275
What's the big idea,
kicking my guts out?

198
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:52,125
When, just now?
When I saved your life?

199
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,300
- And mine.
- Oh, now...

200
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,125
Oh, please.

201
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,525
What's her problem?

202
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:58,800
How much time do you have?

203
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,825
[Carol] What is wrong with you?!

204
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,300
[grunting] What's wrong with you,
lady?

205
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,800
You killed it.

206
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,975
It was beautiful,
and you blew it out!

207
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,650
[screams] You maniacs!

208
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,975
You blew it out! Damn you!

209
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,225
Goddamn you all to hell!

210
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,850
What the hell, Tunt?

211
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,650
You leave me to craft all
the service by myself?

212
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,050
I smelled fire.

213
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,200
You mean smoke.

214
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,500
Uh, no.

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,525
Oh, I can't believe this.

216
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:29,150
Yes, it would appear your
"phantom" has struck agai...

217
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,525
Shh-shh-shh-shh...

218
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,000
Back to work, you...
you goldbricks.

219
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,500
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

220
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,200
[people chattering]

221
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,350
That's exactly the sort of rumor

222
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,850
I don't want you
spreading around.

223
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,550
Maybe this was just an accident.

224
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,700
Nah, somebody definitely
tampered with it.

225
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,750
The brake line's cut,
the steering wheel's tied off,

226
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,750
and the throttle linkage
is jammed wide open.

227
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,075
Yeah, I was gonna say...

228
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,250
linkage jam.

229
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,850
Says the man who pays

230
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,050
to have his Ferrari trucked
around on a flatbed.

231
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
And how much is
that costing you?

232
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,025
Actually, not much more
than just driving it,

233
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,400
when you factor in
all the repairs.

234
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,550
Plus no DUIs.

235
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,850
[chuckling] Well, fewer.

236
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
And shut up.

237
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,875
You wanna try and make me? Huh?

238
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:09,700
Now, listen here, you...
you rounder.

239
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,425
You keep a civil tone
here with Ms. Kane,

240
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,550
or I'll throw you off
this set so fast you'll...

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,700
you'll pass yourself going.

242
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,375
- Wait, what?
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

243
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,200
Archer is my bodyguard,

244
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,875
and if he goes, you can find
yourself another female lead.

245
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:24,450
And on the off chance you
plan to shoot anything today,

246
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,775
I'll be in my dressing room!

247
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,925
Archer? Shall we?

248
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,900
[chuckling] Yes,
we probably shall.

249
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,225
Damn it.

250
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,225
Yeah, well Ellis and I will
be in his dressing room, so...

251
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,800
shall we?

252
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,300
Actually, my dear, I need
to go meet with my investors

253
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,425
to cushion the blow about this,

254
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:44,475
as it were, so... hmm.

255
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,075
So, apparently, you shan't.

256
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,075
Oh, my God, jealous much?

257
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,575
[laughs] Jealous.

258
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,825
It's getting hard to tell the
kettles from the pots around here.

259
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,275
Well, usually,
kettles have whistles.

260
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,575
If that helps.

261
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,825
[sighs]

262
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,950
Hey, Malory,
do you have a minute?

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,950
"Malory"?
What happened to "Ms. Archer"?

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,425
Well, technically,
they both work for me, so...

265
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:10,325
So you thought today would be a good
day to try on your big-boy britches

266
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,425
right in the middle
of a mystery?

267
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,600
That's my point.

268
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,275
I think I may have found a clue.

269
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,825
Well, all right, Cyril.

270
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,675
But you'd better just wind
in that neck, Mr. Man.

271
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,300
So, Archer...

272
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,275
would you say women,
on the whole,

273
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,975
found him attractive?

274
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,650
[chuckles] Which hole?

275
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,125
Because yes.

276
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:30,775
Albeit grudgingly.

277
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,275
[sighs] And sexually,
would you say...

278
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:35,950
[laughing] Which hole?

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,450
[clears throat] Sorry. What?

280
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,325
And would you say he's...
accomplished?

281
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,825
Like, is he good at plowing?

282
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,450
You know he's straight, right?

283
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,475
- I'm...
- Aww, Li'l Baby Elton...

284
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:46,975
I'm straight.

285
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,875
[gasps] Okay, hypothetically...

286
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:52,350
No, not... Wait...
Look, I'm in love with Veronica.

287
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,550
I have been since the first
time I laid eyes on her.

288
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,200
I'll never forget that moment.

289
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,150
It felt like I got kicked
in the chest by a mule.

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,475
Yeah, you don't forget
a hoof to the tits.

291
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,975
Or shooting your first mule.

292
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,975
Wh...
[sighs] How many have you shot?

293
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,525
Hmm... two.

294
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,475
Anyway,
since she and Crane divorced,

295
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:09,900
I thought I might have a chance.

296
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,525
[laughs]

297
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,350
But now I'm worried she
might fall for Archer.

298
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,900
If she hasn't already.

299
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,525
Which...

300
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,000
I just need a moment to change

301
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,175
into something more comfortable.

302
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:22,225

do make yourself at home.

as earned revenue,

321
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,050
lapping, force balancing, uh...

322
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,950
All right, Cyril, I get it.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,750
Yours is a world of
mystery and adventure.

324
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,050
But pretend I'm not HAL 9000.

325
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,575
Okay, the best I can tell,
basically,

326
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,225
the investors on this movie

327
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,450
will make more money if
production shuts down.

328
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
From the production insurance?

329
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,600
It's insured for triple what they
could hope to make at the box office.

330
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,400
But Crane was going on and on about
not wanting to lose the insurance...

331
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,125
Yeah, that's the proverbial rub.

332
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,275
The insurance bond
is actually reinsured

333
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,275
by a shell corporation
in Florida,

334
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:32,575
whose policy is reinsured by
a shell corporation in Panama,

335
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,900
and so on and so
on down the line

336
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,100
until... well,
I lost the trail in Liberia.

337
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,450
Pff. The Cousin
Oliver of Africa.

338
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,250
But the name of the
Florida shell company is...

339
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,950
wait for it... Sandhill-Crane.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,250
So? Some panhandle trash-bird?

341
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,500
[sighs] Not that kind of crane.
Ellis Crane.

342
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,925
I think he's behind this company

343
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:53,925
and all these so-called
"accidents."

344
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:57,825
Which means he would stand to
benefit if production were shut down.

345
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,925
He'd make millions.

346
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,350
Pretty impressive detective work,
if I do say so myself.

347
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,775
And apparently I'm the only
one who's gonna say it, so...

348
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,475
Oh, get over yourself, Rain Man.

349
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:11,100
Sandhill-Crane could
just be a coincidence.

350
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,650
It's not enough
to prove anything.

351
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,775
No, we need to catch
Crane in the act somehow.

352
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,775
Maybe if we used
someone as bait.

353
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,650
Yeah, I don't know.
How would that even...

354
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,325
Where's Gillette?

355
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,150
Yeah, see?
When we feather it out like that,

356
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,625
it really frames your face.

357
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,700
And I mean,
with your cheekbones...

358
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,800
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

359
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,550
What the hell are you doing?

360
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,675
Gripping?

361
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,100
[Malory] All right, Cyril.

362
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,550
So if Crane really is
behind all these accidents,

363
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,025
the question is how
do we catch him?

364
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,675
Oh, you're asking me. Sorry.

365
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,250
I thought that was rhetorical.

366
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,925
Why would I be asking
rhetorical questions?

367
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,200
- Bec...
- That one was.

368
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,600
All right,
so what's the plan, guys?

369
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,750
How do we stop Archer from
hooking up with Veronica?

370
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Umm...

371
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,875
Ooh!
We could throw acid in her face.

372
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,375
Wh... Jesus.

373
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,025
What is wrong with you?

374
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,575
What? Then you swoop in
and take care of her,

375
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,550
and then slowly,
after many years,

376
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,075
she might fall in some weird
semblance of love with you.

377
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,575
Yeah,
I think maybe we can do better.

378
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,275
Okay, but the perfect is
the enemy of the good.

379
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,425
Mm.

380
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,575
Ooh. How about I seduce her?

381
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,275
Yeah,
I don't think she's bisexual.

382
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:26,050
[scoffs] Who cares?

383
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,250
Plus,
I bet she'd prefer the acid.

384
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Hey, you know what?

385
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,100
What are you ninnies doing?

386
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,100
- Looking for acid.
- [together] No, we're not.

387
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,725
This is no time to be taking your
damn drugs, you hippie dropouts.

388
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,900
We think Ellis Crane might be the
one who's sabotaging the production.

389
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,575
Holy shit-snacks.

390
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,900
- Who's Ellis Crane?
- I knew it.

391
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,100
I mean, I didn't know it.
I had no idea whatsoever.

392
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,575
But now that you say it,
it makes total sense.

393
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,950
But what makes you
think it's Crane?

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,575
- Well, I...
- Doesn't matter.

395
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,650
Or it won't,
once we can catch him red-handed,

396
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,925
which is what we're
hatching a plan to do.

397
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:58,625
Ooh. How about I seduce him?

398
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:02,225
[sighs] Pam,
I doubt the man is bisexual.

399
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:04,600
[scoffs] Who care... Wait, what?

400
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,000
And even if he were,
he wouldn't want a blob like you.

401
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,425
I mean, when was the last
time you even saw your penis?

402
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,825
I...

403
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,675
She knows you're a woman, right?

404
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,925
I thought she did.

405
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,500
Wait. You had sex with her.

406
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah,
but she was all tore-up drunk.

407
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,300
Oh, right.
Plus I was wearing a stra...

408
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,950
- Eww!
- What?

409
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,325
Don't ask. You'll gag.

410
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,450
[chuckling] She certainly did.

411
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,675
Who did what?

412
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:30,125
Seriously, don't ask.

413
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:31,675
But let me ask you this.

414
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,125
Do you think there's
anything about Archer

415
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:37,000
that women would
find to be a turnoff?

416
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,450
[laughs] Oh, you're serious.

417
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,300
Well, then, shit.
Where to begin? Umm...

418
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,325
And there is a bit of
a clock on this, so...

419
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,700
- Why?
- Well, he and Veronica

420
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
have been in her dressing
room for a while now.

421
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,175
Uh-huh.

422
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:54,650
And since apparently Archer's
penis is like a crack pipe...

423
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,200
What, in size and/or shape?

424
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,050
They said if he has sex with Veronica,
she'll fall head over heels for him.

425
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,375
Oh, they did, did they?

426
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,850
Yes.

427
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,700
[exhales] Did you, um...

428
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,050
Mm-hmm.

429
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,225
Hm. Me too.

430
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,900
[chuckling] Yes, I know.

431
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,325
Oh, right.

432
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,000
Sorry about the, uh...

433
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,675
- I think it'll come out.
- Phrasing. Still, though.

434
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,825
But as much as I'd love
to lie here and bask

435
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,400
in this post-coital glow...

436
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,250
Right? We've got champagne.

437
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,075
We're over the worst
of the stickiness.

438
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,350
I know,
but it's very nearly 3:00.

439
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,875
Really? That late?

440
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,750
Yes, almost exactly 3:00,

441
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,925
and I'm late for a
wardrobe fitting, so...

442
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:37,350
So I'll just wait for you here,
or...

443
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,850
Um, sure.

444
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm sorry I have to run,

445
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,250
but it's almost
the stroke of 3:00.

446
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,050
Yeah, you mentioned...

447
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,550
Mm, mwah. Back soon.

448
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,875
- And I'll be here, slowly drying.
- [door opens, closes]

449
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,200
Ahh...

450
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh, man, I can't believe

451
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,200
I just made love
to Veronica Deane.

452
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,375
I wonder if this is how
Tenzing Norgay felt.

453
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:03,600
Holy shit, I wonder if this is
how Tenzing Norgay always feels.

454
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,375
[Lana] What, sticky?

455
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,625
Gulp.

456
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,625
You know,
we could just confront Crane

457
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,875
- with the evidence.
- The flimsy evidence.

458
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,125
Yeah, but maybe his reaction
would give him away.

459
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,100
Hmm.

460
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,050
All right. So we just barge
into his dressing room and...

461
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,450
ambush him!

462
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,600
Because you said
we were on a break!

463
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,050
So two days later,
your cock's wet?

464
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,425
Oh, I'm sorry, Lana,
is there a grace period?

465
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,500
- If there is, you neglected to tell me.
- There's an acceptable amount of time

466
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,325
before you start cramming
your trash dick...

467
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,900
You never bother to
consult me on anything.

468
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,075
And for your information,
this stupid break wasn't my idea.

469
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,575
It was yours!

470
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,650
Because you,
prolapsed rectum that you are,

471
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,150
are infatuated with
Veronica Deane,

472
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,000
whose cobwebby old snooch, by
the way, I can smell from here.

473
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,925
[chuckles] Well,
it's not cobwebby anymore.

474
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,925
[growls]

475
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,475
[grunting, thudding]

476
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,625
- Lana!
- [Lana yelling]

477
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,675
So that's your plan.

478
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,925
- Yeah.
- In its entirety.

479
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,275
Yep.

480
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,275
We just slam the
door open and say...

481
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,600
Don't do it!

482
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,100
He's riddled with clap!

483
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,275
[Archer] What?

484
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,800
Um...

485
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,275
[both panting]

486
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,325
[together] What?

487
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,275
I, um...

488
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:16,825
Man, you ever do that...

489
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,650
you walk in a room
and you forget why?

490
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,825
- [together] No.
- And what are you looking at?

491
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,350
Wow. It is kind of
like a crack pipe.

492
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,325
Will you idiots please leave so I
can beat this man's ass in private?

493
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,300
Oh, whatever.
I was beating your...

494
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,475
- [woman screams]
- [gasp]

495
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,025
Mother! Move, idiots!

496
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,625
- [Shapiro] Out of my way.
- [Pam] Follow that ass.

497
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,850
Mother!
Mother, are you all right?

498
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
Why wouldn't I be?

499
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,550
I... I heard you scream.

500
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,500
That wasn't me. It was this one.

501
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,725
Well, it was very upsetting.

502
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,650
- [Shapiro] Whoa.
- [Pam] Oh, my God.

503
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,975
[Archer] Oh.
Yeah, that is pretty upsetting.

504
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,525
And what the hell
are you wearing?

505
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:56,000
I think technically
it's a loincloth?

506
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,525
Fashioned out of a
baby-doll nightie.

507
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,825
[sighs]

508
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,400
Well, I'm sorry, Mother.

509
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,825
I didn't know I'd be
going to a funeral.

510
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,425
I would've worn a black one.

511
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,000
[Dietrich] Okay,
people, uh, listen up.

512
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,525
This is now an active
homicide investigation,

513
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:19,425
and while the situation on the
ground may be somewhat fluid...

514
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:22,225
[chuckling] Fluid on the ground,
on the walls...

515
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,025
You shut up!

516
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:27,025
Shut your mouth, or I swear
to Christ in His heaven

517
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,725
I will personally frame
you for this murder!

518
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,200
Hey, bub, remember?

519
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,100
About the thing?

520
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,725
[clears throat] Please
disregard my previous statement.

521
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,075
Merely an ill-advised
attempt at levity.

522
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,075
Okay. And in light of
your various professional,

523
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,200
or, in some cases, personal
relationships with the victim,

524
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,275
at the present time,
you are all persons of interest.

525
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:48,400
[overlapping chattering]

526
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,375
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

527
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:54,075
He didn't say "suspects". Yet.

528
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,375
But until we do
have a suspect...

529
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:58,050
Or suspects.

530
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,725
We are gonna have to ask you

531
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,300
not to leave town
without checking with us.

532
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,050
But that's ridiculous.

533
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,125
It wasn't any of us.
He hired us for protection.

534
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,925
What, like a protection racket?

535
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:09,425
No, you...

536
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,900
We think Crane was caught up

537
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,400
in some sort of insurance fraud,

538
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,575
all the way from
here to Liberia.

539
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,575
Okay, okay. And we're gonna
be looking into all that,

540
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,575
- but in the meantime...
- We've all got alibis.

541
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,975
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

542
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,575
Yeah,
because they'll be easy to check.

543
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,950
We've got an exact
time of death.

544
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,925
But a time-of-death estimate

545
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,825
is only exact to within
maybe one hour, so...

546
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,325
Try one second, gnome-nuts.

547
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,925
[overlapping muttering]

548
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,800
The victim had a
defensive wound.

549
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,750
Bullet went right
through his Rolex.

550
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,625
[imitates gunshot] Exact
time of death, 2:14 p.m.

551
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:40,500
[overlapping chattering]

552
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,275
Well, my goodness,
what a relief.

553
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,625
No, I just mean...

554
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,600
Well, you know, the ex-wife,
a bitter divorce.

555
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm sure I would've
been the prime suspect.

556
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,300
But I couldn't have
murdered Ellis.

557
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,475
I was with you, Archer.

558
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,100
Remember?

559
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,375
Until almost the stroke of 3:00.

560
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,500
Um...

561
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,250
