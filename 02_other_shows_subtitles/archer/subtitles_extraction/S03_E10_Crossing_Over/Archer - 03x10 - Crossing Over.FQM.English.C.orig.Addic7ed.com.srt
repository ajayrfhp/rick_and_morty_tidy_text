1
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:03,078
Oh, God.

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,867
ARCHER: Ugh, no, forget the glass,
Woodhouse, just gimme the pitcher...

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:10,058
For I am a sinner in the
hands of an angry God.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,672
Bloody Mary, full of vodka, blessed
are you among cocktails...

5
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:19,653
Pray for me, now and at the hour of
my death, which I hope is soon, amen.

6
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:26,336
WOODHOUSE: Er, perhaps a coddled egg...
ARCHER: No. No eggs, Woodhouse.

7
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:27,606
Maybe ever again.

8
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,075
WOODHOUSE: Some dry toast?

9
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:31,376
ARCHER: Yeah, or you could skip a
step and just feed me some vomit.

10
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:34,182
WOODHOUSE: Not like you
to get a hangover, sir.

11
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,683
ARCHER: Yeah, I don't
know what happened.

12
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:41,489
I kinda remember being at the wake...
MALORY: Oh, you poor dear.

13
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,093
On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents,
please let me be the first to

14
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,860
offer my condolences.

15
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:51,898
ARCHER: And let me be the first to
welcome you back into the dating pool.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,168
(burp) And-or-also my
new, hic, hot tub.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,305
But after that it's just... snippets.

18
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,443
I think I had one more drink there...
EVERYBODY: Drink, drink, drink, drink!

19
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:07,283
ARCHER: And then I think I took a cab...
Hang on, wait, lemme see some hands!

20
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,586
Who wants chicken and waffles?!

21
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,855
How did we bring food in here?!

22
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:15,258
Oh, and also, did we
lose some people?!

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,360
PAM: Lana'n Cyril bailed!

24
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:18,829
Triflin bitches!

25
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:22,566
Here! Less yer a triflin bitch too!

26
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:26,136
ARCHER: Agh!
What'd I just put inside me?!

27
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:27,304
PAM: Green Russians!

28
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:32,910
It's absinthe and...
Milk, sweet shitsnacks lookit those!

29
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,280
ARCHER: Oh! My! God!

30
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:36,181
That's right!

31
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,486
It's somewhat coming back to me!

32
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:40,354
PAM: Woooo!

33
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,823
I'm Pacman Jones!

34
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,425
ARCHER: Come home with me!

35
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:46,495
Plus my valet will
give you some heroin!

36
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:49,364
WOODHOUSE: Thankfully I
didn't have to share.

37
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,234
ARCHER: But she did,
she came home with me!

38
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,902
I remember!

39
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:55,105
I mean, Green Russians, it's
fuzzy, I don't remember this...

40
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:58,876
But I do remember her being the
best sex I've ever had in my life!

41
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:01,680
WOODHOUSE: Er --
ARCHER: Shut up, and that includes Europe, Lana,

42
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:03,048
my Brazilian au pair...!

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,819
No woman has ever made me -- oh shit!

44
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,519
WOODHOUSE: Sir...?

45
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,420
ARCHER: Phone number?!

46
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:08,921
Matchbook?!

47
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,458
I don't know her name, where she works...
Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her?!

48
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,426
WOODHOUSE: Ahem.

49
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,061
You might check the loo.

50
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:15,995
ARCHER: What, here?!

51
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,329
Why didn't you say so?!

52
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,597
WOODHOUSE: Oww!

53
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,433
ARCHER: Oww!

54
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:26,672
Ow, ow, ow... Uh, so hey, hi.

55
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:30,943
I'm Sterling Archer, you may
remember me from the strip club,

56
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:33,947
and hopefully also from what was
hands down the most incredible

57
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:37,050
sex that I personally have ever had.

58
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:45,127
Hello? Oh right, so I know we had an
implied oral agreement about heroin...

59
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:45,994
PAM: Heroin?!

60
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:46,628
ARCHER: Wh-?!

61
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,065
PAM: That's the last
frickin thing I need.

62
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,902
I'm bound up tighter'n dick's hatband.

63
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:57,106
ARCHER: No, not...
were you...? Did we...?

64
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,274
PAM: Yeah, we did.

65
00:02:58,276 --> 00:02:59,508
And you loved it!

66
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,844
ARCHER: [incoherent gibberish]

67
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,980
KATHUMP!

68
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:04,932
[FART]

70
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,859
PAM: Okay, jeez, I get it!

71
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,837
ARCHER: Well, you say that, but
I worry that you think I'm

72
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:47,141
exaggerating when I say...
PAM: That I was the best sex you ever had?

73
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,846
ARCHER: No... That if anybody ever finds
out about it, I will literally -

74
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,783
Pam, look at me-
I will literally murder you.

75
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,253
PAM: Not literally...
ARCHER: Yes literally!

76
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:00,089
You will wake up in three
separate fifty-gallon drums!

77
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,858
PAM: That's a hundred
and fifty gallons.

78
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,196
Of Pam's hot, dirty, ball-slappiney...
ARCHER: Gaaghh!

79
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:11,432
PAM: Come at me bro!

80
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:17,639
How ya gonna keep 'em, down on the
farm, after they seen Pam-ee?

81
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:22,111
ARCHER: Yeah, how're you gonna...
I mean, my God, you can't,

82
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:24,580
that, that was just --
MALORY: Disgusting!

83
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:28,117
And I hoped I would never have to say
this, but you finally topped your

84
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,020
tenth grade sports banquet!

85
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:34,057
ARCHER: I -- okay first of all,
Mrs. Coach Mumford came on to me.

86
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,460
And second of all...
what're we talking about?

87
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:39,129
MALORY: Hitting on your
dead colleague's widow?!

88
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:40,364
At his own wake?!

89
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,699
ARCHER: Oh, that.

90
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:45,069
- Okay, so...
- So help me God, Sterling, sometimes I think

91
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,505
that I've failed as a mother.

92
00:04:47,507 --> 00:04:48,539
ARCHER: Sometimes?

93
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,342
MALORY: Oh shut up, and the last
thing you need is another drink.

94
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:55,079
LANA: Ugh, seriously, how can you
be drinking after last night?

95
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:55,980
ARCHER: How can you not?

96
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,783
LANA: Because I don't have a problem.

97
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:02,121
MALORY: Well, I do...
ARCHER: First step's admitting it, Mother.

98
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:02,755
MALORY: Wh-?

99
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:03,889
Not with drinking!

100
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,560
ARCHER: Eh... LANA: Eh...
MALORY: My problem, besides your snide remarks

101
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:10,297
is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.

102
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,633
LANA: And also possibly
Archer's father.

103
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,167
ARCHER: Wh-?

104
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,935
MALORY: How do you know about that?!

105
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,504
LANA: Because I'm part of Everybody?

106
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:19,573
MALORY: Damn that blabbermouthing Pam...
ARCHER: Why, what'd she say?!

107
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:24,045
Besides the stuff about Jakov, which
obviously is what you meant, so...

108
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:27,048
MALORY: So, Nikolai has been dropping
hints that he may want to defect.

109
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,715
ARCHER: What?!

110
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:28,416
LANA: That's awesome!

111
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:29,984
MALORY: I think you mean awful.

112
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:32,687
LANA: Uh, ISIS getting an
inside look at every single

113
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,522
KGB operation in the world?

114
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:35,724
And that's awful how?

115
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,794
MALORY: Because he thinks he's
going to move in with me!

116
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,830
Me, who happens to be in a
relationship with Burt Reynolds,

117
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,765
in case you've forgotten?

118
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,400
ARCHER: I actually did forget that.

119
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:47,169
LANA: Yeah, I never see you together.

120
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,004
I mean, are you like dating, or...?

121
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:50,372
MALORY: It's... complicated.

122
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:55,277
What with our work schedules, and...
work, it's hard to find time

123
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,611
for actual dates.

124
00:05:56,613 --> 00:06:00,749
LANA: But you do see one another...
MALORY: Well yes of course, but --

125
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,317
ARCHER: But never in public, right?

126
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,255
Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or...
PAM: Or on the dirty floor in

127
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,256
the elevator?

128
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,491
MALORY: Wh-? Pam!

129
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:13,296
Get your bloated carcass --
ARCHER: Out, I got it, I'm on this I got it!

130
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:15,431
MALORY: How did she know
about the elevator?

131
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,432
LANA: I -- ew.

132
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,002
MALORY: Burt made sure I
erased the security tape.

133
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:24,940
Wait, could -- you don't think
Burt's ashamed to be seen with me?

134
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:25,607
Lana.

135
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:26,442
LANA: I'm sorry?

136
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:29,611
ARCHER: Well I'm sorry, but if anybody
ever found out I'd die of shame!

137
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,581
PAM: Well how do ya think
that makes me feel?!

138
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,049
ARCHER: I don't care Pam!

139
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:37,086
Now, having said that, would
you please come in this

140
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,455
dirty toilet stall and
have sex with me.

141
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:41,791
PAM: Ugh, oh alright!

142
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:43,493
But this time get in there.

143
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,728
All ya been doin' is givin'

144
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,163
one side hell.

145
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,499
BARRY: Well, when you put it like
that it sounds kinda shitty.

146
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,469
JAKOV: Thirty years of my
life I giff to the KGB?!

147
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:56,206
End now you, this, this
traitorous cyborg?!

148
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,175
Are seeting et my desk?!

149
00:06:58,177 --> 00:06:59,543
How would you put it?!

150
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,312
BARRY: Yeah, you really
got cornholed, huh?

151
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:05,748
Wait, don't answer yet, because I'm
also reassigning you to Siberia.

152
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,116
JAKOV: Wh-?! Siberia?!

153
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:09,719
BARRY: Barry can't have you
moping around here, you know...

154
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,988
sowing the discontent!

155
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,189
BORIS: Is bad for morale.

156
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,157
JAKOV: Et tu, Brute?!

157
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,592
BORIS: Et me, buddy.

158
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:17,326
JAKOV: Rrrrrgh!

159
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,161
BARRY: So here's my advice
to you: dress in layers.

160
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:23,499
And don't even think about doing
anything crazy like defecting...

161
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,201
JAKOV: I would never defect!

162
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:26,903
I love Mother Russia!

163
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,306
BARRY: Even when you're chopping through
the ice in the toilet so you can poop?

164
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:32,308
I'm kidding, obviously.

165
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,412
You'll be like, six hundred
miles from a toilet.

166
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,614
ARCHER: Sorry, had to go to the
bathroom, nothing unusual,

167
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:41,485
just uh, you know, normal,
um, bodily waste excretion.

168
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,987
MALORY: If you're quite finished...
ARCHER: Damn near.

169
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,591
MALORY:... then go home, sober up, and
make sure your apartment is secure.

170
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,759
ARCHER: Uh, why?

171
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:49,760
To all three of those?

172
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,163
MALORY: Because if and when
Nikolai shows up here,

173
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,867
he's not staying at my place...
ARCHER: Well, he's not staying with me!

174
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,435
MALORY: Then go prep the safehouse.

175
00:07:57,437 --> 00:08:01,472
Because you can bet every KGB
agent and freelance assassin

176
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:05,877
this side of Berlin will be
hunting him down like a dog.

177
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,945
ARCHER: Who hunts dogs?

178
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:10,016
CHERYL/CAROL: Orientals, duh!

179
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,861
BARRY: So when you say you assume
Jakov got on that train to Siberia,

180
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:16,829
you know what you're doing?

181
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,043
BORIS: I mek you ess.

182
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,201
BARRY: And Barry doesn't like!

183
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,868
Being made an ass, he really doesn't.

184
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,806
And as you can -- well it's over there
now, but the telex from the Siberia

185
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,366
desk says Jakov never showed up!

186
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:32,511
Now why do you think that might be?!

187
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,513
BORIS: Ummm...
JAKOV: Thenk you, Boris!

188
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,949
I wun't forget this!

189
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,419
BORIS: I promised myself I don't cry.

190
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,320
Promise broke.

191
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,255
BARRY: What was that?

192
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,390
BORIS: Ellergies?

193
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,927
BARRY: To what, making sure
people get on trains?!

194
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,595
Nice one other Barry.

195
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:56,932
Now Jakov's got a twelve-hour head start,
and the details of every single

196
00:08:56,934 --> 00:09:00,535
KGB operation on the globe in
his fat, combed-over head!

197
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,304
BORIS: Da, end we hef
no idea where he went!

198
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,173
BARRY: Well I assume he's
in New York, with those

199
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,341
shitbitchingassbastard Archers!

200
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:08,709
BORIS: But...
BARRY: I can assume!

201
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,812
You're already an ass!

202
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:14,783
So contact our sleeper in New York and
then cancel all my meetings this week,

203
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:17,353
because I will also be in New York.

204
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,222
Murdering people.

205
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,391
JAKOV: Eh, dunt tek this the wrung way?

206
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,829
But I pictured you
having nicer apartment.

207
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,797
[Laughter]

208
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,266
Why thet is funny?

209
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,070
MALORY: Hm? Oh no, sorry, there's
a funny Marmaduke on the fridge.

210
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,671
JAKOV: A what?

211
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:37,443
MALORY: And this is actually,
ahem, the ISIS safehouse, cheers!

212
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,445
JAKOV: Safehouse?

213
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,982
But Melory, I assumed...
MALORY: Which you shouldn't have!

214
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:45,786
What, you thought you'd just show up out
of the blue and we'd move in together?

215
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,921
JAKOV: Pretty much, yeah.

216
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:52,893
MALORY: Nikolai, it's not that I don't-
am not very fond of you, I mean,

217
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,698
we have such history together, and...
JAKOV: End mebbe a son?

218
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,267
MALORY: Mmmmaybe, but...
JAKOV: But so?

219
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,401
Where is he?

220
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:03,769
LANA: Good question.

221
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,338
He was supposed to prep this dump...
GILLETTE: And didn't.

222
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,740
LANA: -- and now he's supposed to be
here for the first shift of guard duty.

223
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,641
CYRIL: And isn't.

224
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,310
JAKOV: Uh -- LANA: Hi, Lana Kane, you
must be Major Jakov, such a pleasure,

225
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,313
be a lamb and take
those to the kitchen?

226
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:16,680
So.

227
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,416
I think I speak for all of us
when I say we shouldn't be the

228
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,652
only ones guarding
your maybe-baby-daddy.

229
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:27,391
MALORY: I can't believe you all know about that...
JAKOV: Wow, thet is big dog!

230
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,225
MALORY: Marmaduke.

231
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,295
And regardless of any...
personal ties I may have with Nikolai,

232
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,298
he's a invaluable asset and
we have to protect him!

233
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,836
I mean, you know...
at least until he's been debriefed.

234
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:38,603
LANA: And then?

235
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,538
What, he's on his own?

236
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,342
MALORY: Um...
LANA: Wow.

237
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,177
ARCHER: I'm serious, you are literally
draining the life out of me.

238
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:51,116
PAM: C'mon, you make me sound like some kinda...
chupacabra, but for dicks.

239
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,086
ARCHER: A terrifying yet
accurate comparison.

240
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,454
Where did you learn all that stuff?

241
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,457
PAM: You know I grew
up on a farm, right?

242
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,860
ARCHER: Really hoping
that's not relevant.

243
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,862
WOODHOUSE: Ms. Kane... and your mother.

244
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,264
ARCHER: Hooray...
PAM: I gotta bounce.

245
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,532
Later taters.

246
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,736
ARCHER: Lana listen, if this is a
booty call, I'm flattered, but --

247
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:10,437
LANA: Oh my God.

248
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,105
MALORY: You're supposed
to be guarding Nikolai!

249
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:16,310
ARCHER: Yeah, so about that, I mean, don't
you think that's gonna be..kinda...

250
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:19,180
JAKOV: [sniffling, weeping]

251
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,014
ARCHER: Awkward?

252
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,716
CYRIL: I actually think
it's kinda sweet.

253
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:22,450
ARCHER: Little help?

254
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:23,218
LANA: No, you're good.

255
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,820
The camera's set up for the debriefing,
and one of us will relieve you

256
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:27,255
in like, eight hours?

257
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,657
ARCHER: Wait, where
are you guys going?!

258
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,091
GILLETTE: Uh, a town called work?

259
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:33,562
LANA: Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in
Brooklyn, thanks to this intel from the

260
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:34,229
major.

261
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,164
JAKOV: It was least I could do.

262
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,300
LANA: Since otherwise he'd kill you?

263
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:39,634
JAKOV: Is win-win.

264
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:44,239
LANA: Is it?

265
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,207
JAKOV: So!

266
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,074
ARCHER: Yeah.

267
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,743
JAKOV: Sterlink!

268
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:49,577
ARCHER: Yeah.

269
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:50,878
JAKOV: Is long time.

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,281
ARCHER: Yeah, when was... oh!
I guess when I was in the

271
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:59,520
dreaded Lubyanka with jumper
cables clamped to my balls!

272
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:04,524
JAKOV: So <i>da</i>, this is...
a little awkward.

273
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:05,525
ARCHER: Yeah.

274
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:06,526
JAKOV: Maybe some shots?

275
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,729
ARCHER: Yeah let's try that!

276
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:15,335
LANA: Any time now... Cyril. Cyril!

277
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:18,439
CYRIL: Lana, I -- I don't
think I'm cut out for this.

278
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,741
LANA: Well, don't take this the wrong
way, but neither does anyone else.

279
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:23,577
Just pretend he's, like, a rabid dog.

280
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,646
CYRIL: Oh God, just like Old Yeller!

281
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:29,916
GILLETTE: Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big
stack of KGB codebooks and fif - forty

282
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,718
thousand bucks in a floor safe.

283
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,188
LANA: And was also identified as a
sleeper agent by the head of the KGB!

284
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,389
KGB AGENT: Who, Barry?!

285
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:36,990
LANA: What?

286
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:37,724
KGB AGENT: White?

287
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:38,825
You guys like smooth R&B?

288
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:39,325
GILLETTE: Duh.

289
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:45,364
LANA: Are you telling me Barry "The Bionic
Douchebag" Dylan is running the KGB?

290
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,966
KGB AGENT: Only if I can defect, too.

291
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,569
Because that dude is
out of his damn mind.

292
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,071
LANA: I'm listening.

293
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,338
KGB AGENT: He's crazy!

294
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,776
I mean he's smart, way smarter than Jakov,
but -- oh, and you can bet Jakov's

295
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:57,844
intel is bad!

296
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,478
LANA: Really?

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,613
This isn't your kneecap?

298
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:00,847
KGB AGENT: Don't you get it?

299
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,817
Barry gave me up so you'd
trust Jakov on the rest!

300
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:08,388
He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so...
LANA: So he's been feeding him fake intel?

301
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,589
KGB AGENT: I mean I assume!

302
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:12,258
Because Barry's got a master
plan, which, when you hear it,

303
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,462
will probably make your head explo...
LANA: Jesus! GILLETTE: Jesus!

304
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,496
LANA: Ahem. Cyril?

305
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,664
CYRIL: I'm sorry!

306
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,032
LANA: Yes.

307
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,701
Yes you are.

308
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,870
JAKOV: Is I who em sorry!

309
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,272
I should hef been there for you!

310
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:33,211
ARCHER: Shut up, don't do that, I mean
what were you gonna do, marry my mother?

311
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,479
Have you met her?

312
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:34,979
Oww!

313
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,349
JAKOV: Dun't you ever disrespect her!

314
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:42,153
ARCHER: You're not my dad!

315
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,389
[Laughter]

316
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,958
JAKOV: How would you know?!

317
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,426
ARCHER: I know, right?!

318
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,698
JAKOV: But I hef to say,
you dun't look like me!

319
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,836
ARCHER: And don't take this the
wrong way, but thank Christ!

320
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:57,837
Oww!

321
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,738
CHERYL/CAROL: Watch it!

322
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,272
You dumb idiot!

323
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:00,306
BARRY: Oh man, I am so sorry!

324
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:03,977
Here, lemme get you some...
oh my God, Cheryl?

325
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,278
CHERYL/CAROL: Barry?!

326
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,814
BARRY: Wow, I was hoping
I'd bump into you!

327
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:08,648
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, really?

328
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,483
BARRY: And darn if I didn't!

329
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,151
Literally!

330
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:14,454
CHERYL/CAROL: You -- wait a minute, why
am I thinking you live in like, Russia?

331
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,423
BARRY: Mmmmaybe the tracksuit?

332
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,693
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh, right, and which, by
the way, you are totally rockiiiing.

333
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:23,663
BARRY: Oh, that's just...
my huge muscles.

334
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:26,866
CHERYL/CAROL: So tell me...
how strong are you?

335
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:29,134
BARRY: Insanely, wanna get outta here?

336
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,702
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, totally,
but like it has to be

337
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,071
your place, because mine
reeks of ocelot piss.

338
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,940
BARRY: I have no response to that...
CHERYL/CAROL: Doesn't merit one.

339
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,743
BARRY:... and my place is currently flooding so...
CHERYL/CAROL: Hotel?

340
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:42,078
BARRY: Damn, no money.

341
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,546
Tracksuit, no pockets.

342
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,347
CHERYL/CAROL: Damn it!

343
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,883
BARRY: I know, it's the
one single drawback.

344
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,585
Wait, doesn't ISIS have a safehouse?

345
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,121
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but...
You have promise that all that

346
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:55,324
horrific stuff I think I remember
about you is just false memories?

347
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,526
BARRY: I...
CHERYL/CAROL: Because I get those a lot.

348
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,496
BARRY: Cross the microchip in my heart.

349
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,664
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't
get all girly on me.

350
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,732
Check!

351
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,190
MALORY: Hold the door!

352
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,463
Hold the door!

353
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:08,947
PAM: Headin out?

354
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,484
MALORY: No, I thought I'd just take all
my things for a ride on the elevator.

355
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,585
PAM: Okay.

356
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,254
MALORY: I actually have a date.

357
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,488
With Burt Reynolds.

358
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,757
We're watching Gator.

359
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,624
PAM: Your place?

360
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,628
MALORY: Well if we go out, you
know, he's just mobbed, so...

361
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,532
PAM: So it's a DVD, a box of wine and
some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.

362
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,066
MALORY: No!

363
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,268
Well, it's not a box of wine.

364
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:35,374
Pam, let me ask you something...
JAKOV: How ken you just leave me here?!

365
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:39,045
ARCHER: Mainly because I have an
incredibly addictive personality.

366
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:42,348
So just debrief yourself with the
camera, and when I get back we'll talk

367
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,152
about the DNA test thing, if, ya
know, you're still into doing that.

368
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,355
JAKOV: Of course I em still into thet!

369
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:52,525
But in meantime, you
think I will be safe?

370
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,494
ARCHER: God, what's Russian for duh?

371
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,561
It's a safehouse!

372
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:56,963
Nobody knows where it is!

373
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,899
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, here it is!

374
00:15:58,901 --> 00:15:59,700
BARRY: Neat.

375
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:01,268
Can I see your neck a minute?

376
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:08,677
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh, Barry...
Barry? Barry!

377
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,047
Barrryyyygrrghhh!

378
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:15,050
PAM: ... my point is, if you're
confident in yourself as a woman,

379
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,586
who cares if he wants
to keep it on the DL?

380
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:20,455
MALORY: Well yes, but...
PAM: But nothin!

381
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,592
Because who's to say you're
not using him for sex?

382
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:25,894
MALORY: Pam, don't take
this the wrong way?

383
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,596
But you're not nearly
as stupid as you look.

384
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,998
PAM: Okay.

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,732
ARCHER: Mmmyello?

386
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,634
LANA: Archer don't talk, just listen!

387
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,502
ARCHER: Why, what's up?

388
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:37,038
What're you -- LANA: Jakov's intel is bad
and Barry's got some sort of master

389
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,776
plan that we're clueless about, thanks to Cyril --
CYRIL: Who has apologized

390
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,578
profusely...
GILLETTE: Quiet game!

391
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,116
LANA: -- so we're gonna regroup at the
safehouse and try to... figure out...

392
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:47,751
God damn it.

393
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:48,451
GILLETTE: What.

394
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:50,187
LANA: Wait for it.

395
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,755
ARCHER: Ha ha haaaa!

396
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:56,760
Leave it!

397
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:57,828
JAKOV: <i>Da, da!</i>

398
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,296
<i>Keep your shirt on!</i>

399
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,800
<i>BARRY: Barry doesn't wear a shirt.</i>

400
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,203
<i>Ruins Barry's whole tracksuit vibe.</i>

401
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,505
<i>MALORY: I swear to God, if
he put as much effort into</i>

402
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,875
<i>his job as he does into
those idiot voicemails...</i>

403
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,677
<i>and you say got this
from a KGB sleeper?</i>

404
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,612
<i>LANA: Right before Cyril
blew his head off.</i>

405
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:17,847
<i>MALORY: What?!</i>

406
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:24,620
<i>JAKOV: You son of bitch, you
ektually think you will get away with this?!</i>

407
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:25,721
<i>BARRY: Obviously!</i>

408
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,189
<i>Why else would I do it?</i>

409
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,025
<i>JAKOV: Who knows with
you, you're crezzy!</i>

410
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:32,861
<i>BARRY: Am I?!</i>

411
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,664
<i>Between Archer ruining my life
and you dicks turning me into</i>

412
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,768
<i>a cyborg, I'm kind of
amazed I'm even this sane.</i>

413
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,370
<i>Which is obviously a
relative term, but --</i>

414
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:42,472
<i>JAKOV: What are you doing?</i>

415
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,140
<i>BARRY: Rationalizing my behavior.</i>

416
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:45,141
<i>JAKOV: With gess.</i>

417
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:46,276
<i>BARRY: Oh.</i>

418
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,510
<i>Killing you.</i>

419
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,346
<i>JAKOV: Oh.</i>

420
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:53,317
<i>BARRY: Oh, Marmaduke...
JAKOV: End gess is nut so bad</i>

421
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,320
<i>way to die...
BARRY: Well again, relative term.</i>

422
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:59,123
<i>JAKOV: End efterwerd,
if Sterlink want,</i>

423
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,892
<i>he ken still get some
DNA from my body,</i>

424
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,461
<i>end find out if I em his real father.</i>

425
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:06,797
<i>BARRY: Which I'm sure would
provide him with some</i>

426
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,434
<i>much-needed closure...
Which is why it's not gonna happen.</i>

427
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,169
<i>JAKOV: Why, what is thet?</i>

428
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,606
<i>BARRY: This - glad you asked -
is a block of ice with a fork</i>

429
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,206
<i>frozen in it.</i>

430
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,842

431

fork-filled block of ice in this</i>

<i>microwave oven... Now I'm setting
the timer for five -- Oh heck,</i>

433
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,151
<i>let's call it ten minutes.</i>

434
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,053
<i>Doesn't matter, ice can't tell time.</i>

435
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,657
<i>JAKOV: It ken unly melt...
BARRY: And when it does...</i>

436
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:38,195
<i>JAKOV: Spark from fork, gas from stuv...

00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:42,233
<i>JAKOV: End no DNA left for papa test...
BARRY: Nope.</i>

438
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,501
<i>Just uncertainty and doubt.</i>

439
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:47,572
<i>Which hopefully, over time, will
eventually drive Archer insane.</i>
