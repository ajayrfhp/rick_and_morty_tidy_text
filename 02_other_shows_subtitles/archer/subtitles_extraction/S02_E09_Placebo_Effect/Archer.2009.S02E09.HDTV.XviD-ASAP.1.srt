1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,376
KRIEGER: So there's your breast
cancer tumor, and the portacath,

2
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:08,894
through which you take cyclophosphamate
intravenously...

3
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:09,860
ARCHER: Sim.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,448
KRIEGER: And you're taking
tetraphenol orally?

5
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:13,916
ARCHER: E também português.

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,184
Em CD-ROM.

7
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,086
KRIEGER: Boa sorte!

8
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:18,221
ARCHER: Obrigado.

9
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:20,690
And I dunno Krieger, maybe it's
because I'm just a badass,

10
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:22,392
but chemotherapy is
kind of a breeze.

11
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:23,711
KRIEGER: Yeah, that's my point.

12
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:26,895
Two weeks of chemo with no hair
loss, and you're not experiencing

13
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:29,255
- any nausea?
- No, gracias a

14
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,215
dubi mediciano.

15
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,403
Which, I gotta tell ya: huge fan.

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,337
KRIEGER: Yeah?

17
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:35,838
ARCHER: Yeah, and I
advocate its use.

18
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:38,107
As a potential role
model, I advocate it.

19
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:42,003
KRIEGER: To combat chemotherapy-related
nausea, or for cannabidiol's

20
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:45,581
clinically-proven ability to
inhibit cancer cell growth?

21
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:46,716
ARCHER: It does that?

22
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:48,863
KRIEGER: Yep, and if you
need more lemme know.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,787
I got a guy.

24
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:53,389
ARCHER: Me too.
He's called a pharmacist.

25
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,902
KRIER: Yeah, and is he the same pharmacist
who gave you all these chemo drugs?

26
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:58,391
ARCHER: Well he damn sure
didn't give it to me.

27
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:01,068
You would not believe how
much cancer medicine costs...

28
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:04,154
Those pills are like eighty
bucks each, and the IV stuff is

29
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:07,450
literally two grand a bag, so
why the hell are you poking

30
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,307
a hole in my bag Krieger?!

31
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:11,407
KRIEGER: Because I want
to run a few tests.

32
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:16,512
And so, if the reagent turns blue...
ARCHER: What does that mean, is that good?

33
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,915
KRIEGER: No. It means this
eighty-dollar pill is one

34
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:20,349
hundred percent sucrose.

35
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,551
ARCHER: What?
KRIEGER: Sugar?

36
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:23,186
ARCHER: I know what
sucrose is, idiot!

37
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:24,954
But there's medicine
in there too, right?!

38
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,899
KRIEGER: Ummm, no. Not a trace.

39
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,043
ARCHER: Wh-?! So I've been treating
my breast cancer with... sugar pills?!

40
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:33,062
KRIEGER: Yeah, you didn't think it was
weird your chemo drugs were chewable?

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,198
ARCHER: No!
Little kids get cancer!

42
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:36,165
KRIEGER: Aww... they do.

43
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,067
ARCHER: What about the
intravenous drug?!

44
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,470
KRIEGER: Right, yes,
the cyclophosphamate.

45
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,505
Mmmm...
ARCHER: "Mmmm" what?!

46
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,933
KRIEGER: "Mmmm" no, this
isn't cyclophosphamate.

47
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,318
ARCHER: Well what the... Krieger!
What the hell is it?!

48
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,657
KRIEGER: Well, this is just an
educated guess, but... Zima?

49
00:01:54,691 --> 00:02:05,230
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

50
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,215
Oh my God, are you serious?

51
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:35,142
MALORY: Counterfeit cancer drugs?!

52
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:37,750
ARCHER: Yeah, basically
candy corn and Zima.

53
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:39,285
LANA: Jesus...
ARCHER: Which, probably why I've

54
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:42,154
been in such a great mood, but
MALORY: But Sterling, your tumor!

55
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,956
All this time, it's been...?

56
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,024
ARCHER: Growing, I guess.

57
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,311
MALORY: Oh, Sterling...
LANA: Plus God knows how many

58
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,947
other cancer patients have
been taking that stuff.

59
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,135
ARCHER: Like Ruth...
PHARMACIST: Here you go, folks.

60
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,734
A week's supply of breast cancer
chemotherapy drugs, and of course,

61
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,935
your medical marijuana.

62
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:59,004
RUTH: Oh, you poor thing.

63
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,705
Does someone you love
have breast cancer?

64
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,075
ARCHER: Yeah. Me.

65
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:05,611
I'm uh, name's Archer.
RUTH: Ruth.

66
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,346
And don't you worry, dear.

67
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,915
We can beat cancer
with this medicine.

68
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,651
Even if I can barely pay for it.

69
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,623
ARCHER: Don't you worry, Ruth...
I'm gonna make them pay for it.

70
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,759
MALORY: What're you...
Sterling no, you're not well!

71
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,027
What are you going to do?

72
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:25,130
ARCHER: Cry havoc, and let
slip the hogs of war.

73
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,498
LANA: Dogs of war.

74
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,815
ARCHER: Whatever farm animal
of war, Lana, shut up.

75
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,382
PHARMACIST: [terrified whimper]

76
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,583
LANA: I think he gets it.

77
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,186
ARCHER: Just film the confessions,
Lana, don't editorialize.

78
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:47,720
Do you get it?

79
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,755
PHARMACIST: Yes! Look, please...
ARCHER: Because I swear

80
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:52,524
to God I will strip back down
and show you all over again.

81
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:53,959
PHARMACIST: I get it! I get it!

82
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,127
You have a lot of guns!

83
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,095
ARCHER: And a knife.

84
00:03:56,162 --> 00:04:00,223
Which I am going to push, very slowly,
into your urethra...

85
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,147
LANA: Ew.

86
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,464
ARCHER:... if you don't answer
my questions. Number one...

87
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:07,139
ARCHER: Wow. What a pussy.

88
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,908
I could barely even keep up, he
was spilling the beans so fast.

89
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:12,358
LANA: Well, you threatened to
shove a knife up his dick hole.

90
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:14,046
Which again, ick.

91
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:16,448
ARCHER: Well excuse me,
Lana, it's a rampage.

92
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:17,383
LANA: Still though.

93
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,184
You really wanna take
on the Irish mob?

94
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:19,952
ARCHER: No, I don't.

95
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,321
But they're the ones switching
out life-saving cancer drugs

96
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,189
with candy and Zima!

97
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:26,458
And why couldn't it
be the Brazilian mob?

98
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:29,349
Estou aprendendo português.

99
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,632
Plus I can only assume a
Brazilian mob would be a

100
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,106
jillion times sexier.

101
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:39,872
Seriously, these potato-heads
have to be the unsexiest mob

102
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,740
of all time.

103
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,642
PADDY: You know who yer
messin with, boyo?!

104
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,786
You ve any idea who our boss is?!

105
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:49,796
Nope, but 100 people surveyed
number 1 answered I'm the board.

106
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,606
Name the douchebag,
who's in charge.

107
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:53,742
PADDY: Vincent.

108
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:56,232
Van Go[BEEP]yerself.

109
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,681
ARCHER: Vincent Van
Go[BEEP]myself.

110
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,726
Survey says!

111
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,629
LANA: Jesus, Archer!
ARCHER: What, Lana?!

112
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,963
I said it was a rampage!

113
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,298
LANA: Still though!

114
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:06,999
PADDY: Rrrngh!

115
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:07,833
Oh, you son of a hoor!

116
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,669
ARCHER: Save it for
the Fast Money round.

117
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:14,106
Hundred people surveyed, number
one answer's still on the board.

118
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,042
Name the douchebag,
who's in charge.

119
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,645
Gonk gonk. Need an answer.

120
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,513
ARCHER: Cock-flavored spit.

121
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,482
Well, you never know what's
going to be on the board.

122
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,118
Let me see cock-flavored spit.

123
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,786
Guys, that's two strikes!

124
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,789
One more and the innocent
Honduran janitors get a chce

125
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,424
to steal the bank!

126
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:35,327
ARCHER: I'm just assuming you guys don't
know what actually goes on here.

127
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:36,598
Hope that doesn't sound racist.

128
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,466
Okay, kid...
LANA: He is a kid, Archer, so...

129
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,766
ARCHER: Lana!
You're in the isolation booth!

130
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,581
Looking for the douchebag, who's in...
PADDY: Mikey Hannity,

131
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:47,139
You say one word and I'll cut
yer yella heart out myself...

132
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,607
MIKEY: Oh! Christ!

133
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:50,943
ARCHER: Mikey, listen to me.

134
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,177
I have breast cancer.

135
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:53,745
TOMMY: Ha! Breast cancer.

136
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:58,048
ARCHER: So you'll forgive my impatience
because I and a lot of other people

137
00:05:58,168 --> 00:05:59,901
I've been trying to fight cancer

138
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,573
- with your bosses fake chemo drugs.
- Chemo?

139
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:05,659
They just told me it was cream for
male pattern baldness.

140
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,377
Do I look like I need bald guy cream?

141
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:08,274
No, but I...

142
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:10,127
Luckily, I can barely get a comb
through this.

143
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,081
It's so thick my barber charges me double.

144
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,177
I love my hair.

145
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:16,535
- As I am sure you love your kneecap.
- Franny Delaney.

146
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,122
He rules everything out here and Brooklyn.

147
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,549
Numbers, protection, dope, prostitution.

148
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,213
Victimless crimes, Mickey.

149
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,702
Tell me about the counterfeit chemo drugs.

150
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:26,644
They make the pharmacist
buy the real stuff.

151
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,078
Delaney says... I swear I don't know who,

152
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,003
but they switch it
with the fake stuff here.

153
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,162
And those pricks do out the packet.

154
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:36,631
What? You guys are in on this?
And I was worried about sounding racist.

155
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,846
- Were you?
- They don't even know what goes on here.

156
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,192
They can't even read English.

157
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,028
What all those dirty beaners care about is

158
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,870
- taking American jobs.
- Well, relax, Kennedy.

159
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,953
It wasn't all that long ago
that everybody hated the Irish.

160
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,654
For swarming over here

161
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:50,241
in their potato boats
and taking all the jobs.

162
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,908
Yeah, they... Wait, what?

163
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,065
And I'm pretty sure...

164
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,399
...and guys feel free to correct me...

165
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,720
...that Beaner is a
pejorative term for a Mexican,

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,392
Is that corrector or nao?

167
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,802
Huh... Had to be a little more
overlap with the Portuguese.

168
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,187
Well, plus they're gagged.

169
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,547
Still, though...
And third, is this the real stuff?

170
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,620
MIKEY: Yeah, this is all real.
Why?

171
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,098
ARCHER: Because I'm way
behind on my treatment.

172
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,561
LANA: Wait, Archer,
what are you doing?

173
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,738
ARCHER: I'm sorry, did I
mention I have cancer?

174
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:16,878
LANA: I know, but now?
In... mid-rampage?

175
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,368
You really think
that's a good idea?

176
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,937
ARCHER: To take my prescribed
chemotherapy

177
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,153
for my said aforementioned cancer?!

178
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,688
Yes, idiot! I do!

179
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,746
I'm sorry I called you an idiot.

180
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,080
LANA: Yeah?

181
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:32,682
ARCHER: Yeah, you
were totally right.

182
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,317
Not a smart mid-rampage move.

183
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:36,419
LANA: Wh-?!
And you think that is?!

184
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,698
ARCHER: Yes, idiot! I do!

185
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,058
Sorry. Again. I'm not myself.

186
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,848
But you are kinda being a bitch.

187
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:54,364
LANA: Okay so, day two of the
chemo-fueled rampage and, wow,

188
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,432
how ya holdin up?

189
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,761
ARCHER: Not great.
Uh, I've got wine coolers on my feet,

190
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,598
because my toenails are popping
off like pogs, uh,

191
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:05,823
fair amount of gastric distress,
and umm...scarf.

192
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:06,952
LANA: Yeah well, suck it up.

193
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,761
I tracked Delaney to an
all-night poker game.

194
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:10,196
ARCHER: Great, one second?

195
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:16,643
I never thought I'd say this,
but I really miss the Zima.

196
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:21,268
MALORY: I mean was I there for every
single recital and lacrosse game? No.

197
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,412
Is our adult relationship perfect?

198
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:24,541
No.

199
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,322
But I... I just can't even imagine
life without my precious Sterling.

200
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,711
GILLETTE: Have you
ever told him that?

201
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,318
MALORY: What, are you kidding?
No.

202
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:32,246
GILLETTE: Wow, really?

203
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:35,071
My mom told me how much she
loved me all the time.

204
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,840
MALORY: Exactly.
Look how you turned out.

205
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:39,376
GILLETTE: Um...
with high self-esteem?

206
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,311
PAM: Whatcha doin, Krieger?

207
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,080
KRIEGER: Well I feel bad for
Archer, so I'm making him some

208
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,582
Portuguese flashcards.

209
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,465
CYRIL: Portuguese?

210
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:49,152
But isn't... I thought
Krieger was a German name.

211
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,021
KRIEGER: Oh, über German.
It means "warrior."

212
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,081
CHERYL/CAROL: So how come
you know Portuguese?

213
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:56,119
KRIEGER: Because I grew up
in Braz... istol County, Rhode Island?

214
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,228
Lotta Portuguese in Rhode Island.

215
00:08:58,348 --> 00:08:59,111
CYRIL: Where you're from.

216
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,037
KRIEGER: Born and raised!

217
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:01,771
CYRIL: Uh-huh.
What's the state capital?

218
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,538
KRIEGER: Of?

219
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:03,827
CYRIL: Rhode Island.

220
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,270
KRIEGER: Dallas?
CYRIL: Aha!

221
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,066
PAM: What?

222
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:08,886
CHERYL/CAROL: It's Austin, duh!

223
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,340
CYRIL: It's Providence!

224
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,976
But I bet he knows the capital of Brazil!
Don't you?!

225
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:14,878
KRIEGER: I don't have to answer that!
Who do...

226
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,280
CYRIL: Warum hast du
Umzug nach Brasilien?!

227
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,164
KRIEGER: Weiter den
Kampf der mein Führer!

228
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,205
Scheisse.

229
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:24,402
CYRIL: Oh my God...
PAM: What the heck was that all about?

230
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,806
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh!

231
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,659
I actually have no idea.

232
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,713
PAM: No shit.

233
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,356
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, I
don't know why I do that.

234
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,750
LANA: Because I don't
want it in my car!

235
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,001
ARCHER: Well what do you
want me to do, Lana,

236
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,112
just throw it out the window?!

237
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:41,268
LANA: Obviously!
ARCHER: Oh.

238
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,474
Ha-ha. Uh-oh.

239
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,324
Gonna be sick again.

240
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:46,598
LANA: Not in here you're not.

241
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:48,583
- Then pull over, Lana.
- No, we're late.

242
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,000
You already missed your
shot at Delaney as it is.

243
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,983
ARCHER: Well then now
this is happening.

244
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,050
LANA: Wh-?

245
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:55,315
ARCHER: Lana, did
you see my scarf?

246
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,520
LANA: Yes, Archer, I saw your scarf.

247
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,657
ARCHER: All my hair fell out.
LANA: I'm sorry.

248
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,179
ARCHER: Me too.
It was my fifth best feature.

249
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:08,798
RUTH: Oh, I think it's your sweetness...
ARCHER: Nobody's ever called me sweet before.

250
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:12,820
RUTH: Well, you're sweet enough to come
see a sick old lady in the hospital.

251
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,503
ARCHER: What?

252
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,574
I didn't come by to see you, I'm
trying to bang a candy-striper.

253
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,137
But, um... it's not good, huh?

254
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,411
RUTH: No, dear.

255
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:24,914
Afraid it's just not responding
to those chemo drugs.

256
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,083
NURSE: You two can't
smoke in here!

257
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,463
RUTH: Oh, unwad your panties.

258
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:32,589
ARCHER: Yeah!

259
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:33,652
LANA: Archer!

260
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,293
ARCHER: What?!
LANA: We're here.

261
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,145
ARCHER: Oh. Right.

262
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,585
LANA: You good?

263
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,741
ARCHER: Rampaaaaaaaaage!

264
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,246
LANA: [sigh]

265
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,621
ARCHER: Little help?

266
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,227
KRIEGER: Leave me alone!

267
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,642
I'm not a Nazi!

268
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,244
CYRIL: Yeah, well what
about your father?!

269
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,513
KRIEGER: No, he was a scientist!

270
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,948
CYRIL: Pretty sure the
Nazis had scientists.

271
00:10:59,016 --> 00:10:59,916
KRIEGER: No they didn't!

272
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:02,270
That's why we...
They lost the war!

273
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,420
Lack of science!

274
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:08,024
CYRIL: Well, we'll just see what Ms. Archer
has to say about this Nazi beeswax.

275
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,170
KRIEGER: Fine!

276
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,985
Or, you know... not fine.

277
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,233
LANA: Because between the cancer
and the chemo and the just

278
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,536
shit-tons of weed...
ARCHER: Actually yeah, good idea,

279
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,313
let's hang back a
sec and burn one down.

280
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:25,863
LANA: No. And I know it's not my business,
but I think you might have a problem.

281
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,427
ARCHER: Yeah, it's called cancer?

282
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:28,599
LANA: Well, and drug abuse.

283
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,830
ARCHER: Thanks, Woodsy.

284
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,614
The Drug Owl.

285
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,483
Now shut up and kick
in the door for me.

286
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:35,141
And do it badass like I would.

287
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,787
If I still had toenails.

288
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:39,422
WHITEY: Shite, Joey,
ya call this a hand?

289
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,323
More like a foot.

290
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:43,363
A great big...
ARCHER: Franny Delaney!

291
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,795
Stand your ass up!

292
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,764
WHITEY: Oh, ya just missed him.

293
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,239
Shame too, cuz he just
loves the E Street Band.

294
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,372
ARCHER: Did he just
crack on my scarf?

295
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,151
LANA: I think he did.
What the shit, Archer?!

296
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,453
ARCHER: Oh, ow, sorry.
You idiot, asshole.

297
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:05,639
Now we're even, Lana. From the time
you did that to me. I am sorry.

298
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,187
WHITEY: Speakin of hurt, boy,
yer steppin into a great big world of it.

299
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:15,840
So I suggest ya take yer bulldyke friend...
ARCHER: Lana! Lana!

300
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,561
Lanaaaaa!
LANA: What!

301
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,330
ARCHER: Well first of all
you don't have to yell, Lana.

302
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,631
I don'have ear cancer.

303
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,902
Second, until I find out where
Delaney is, please stop shooting people.

304
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,404
WHITEY: Go ahead and shoot me!

305
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,939
Cuz ain't nothin in the
world can make me talk!

306
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:35,011
ARCHER: Well, you say that...
WHITEY: W-what are ya doin back there?!

307
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,181
ARCHER: Don't worry about what I'm
doing, concentrate on what you're doing.

308
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:39,582
WHITEY: W-what am I doin?

309
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,352
ARCHER: For starters you can
apologize to my friend for

310
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,486
your homophobic remarks.

311
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,415
WHITEY: I-I'm sorry, darlin!
I had no idea you were a gay!

312
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,906
LANA: What? ARCHER: She's not gay,
she just has big hands.

313
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,608
LANA: What?
ARCHER: Nothing, shut up.

314
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,323
I'm gonna assume you know the
difference between an M-26 and

315
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:55,842
a Mark Two fragmentation grenade, so...
WHITEY: What?!

316
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,777
LANA: What?
ARCHER: Oh sorry, do you not?

317
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:02,139
Okay, the Mark Two has kinda...
nubbly ridges?

318
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,080
Ya feel those?

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,475
Different circumstances, might
actually feel pretty good.

320
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,477
WHITEY: W-wait, son, now
just wait a second...

321
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:10,108
ARCHER: Another key difference
is the pin.

322
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,647
WHITEY: Oh, Jaysus...
ARCHER: See? The striking

323
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:13,790
lever's the same, though.

324
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,673
Spring-loaded.

325
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,797
Which reminds me: did you know
that men can also benefit from

326
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,389
doing Kegel exercises?

327
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:20,059
WHITEY: [terrified whimper]

328
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,419
ARCHER: Case in point, huh?

329
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,155
Now where's your
cancer-patient-killing boss?

330
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:25,820
ARCHER: Okay I got it, let's go.

331
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,267
LANA: Wait, you're just gonna leave
him with a grenade stuck up his ass?!

332
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,178
ARCHER: Yes, Lana,
I am on a rampage!

333
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:31,796
And also kidding,
it's a smoke grenade.

334
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,749
WHITEY: Oh, thank...

335
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,099
LANA: Asshole.
ARCHER: What?

336
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,876
LANA: What?

337
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,013
ARCHER: What? What. Lana.

338
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:50,627
ARCHER: What?!
I thought it was a smoke grenade.

339
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,754
LANA: They look exactly nothing alike!

340
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,172
ARCHER: What?

341
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,494
ARCHER: What're you doing,
Delaney's not here.

342
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:02,263
LANA: No, but my ENT doctor is.

343
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:03,188
ARCHER: You like him?

344
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,632
Because I sure do.

345
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,643
Good bedside manner, knows
all the parts of the ear.

346
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,800
- What was his name again?
- Mr. Archer?

347
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,620
I guess you heard about Ruth.

348
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,613
ARCHER: What?
NURSE: About Ruth. I guess you heard.

349
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,754
ARCHER: What?!
NURSE: Ruth! Your friend! Is dead!

350
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:17,523
ARCHER: W-what?

351
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:21,983
RUTH: Regis. I wake up early
every morning and watch Regis.

352
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:25,383
And that smile of his...
well, it gets me through the day.

353
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:27,468
ARCHER: I'm gonna
start doing that.

354
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:29,157
RUTH: Oh, you must.

355
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:32,659
Regis is the best.
ARCHER: No, Ruth...you're the best.

356
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:34,972
LANA: Archer.
ARCHER: Hm?

357
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,541
LANA: Archer!
ARCHER: What? ! Oh.

358
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,601
Man, what've I been doing?

359
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:42,959
LANA: Chain-smoking joints
the size of tampons.

360
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,482
ARCHER: Ew.
LANA: Figure of speech.

361
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:45,322
ARCHER: Still though. Ew.

362
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,642
LANA You're not rampaging?
I thought you were rampaging.

363
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,111
ARCHER: Right yes, here we go.
Alright.

364
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,109
I got this.! Franny Delaney!

365
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,339
Let's take a walk!

366
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,582
DELANEY: A walk?

367
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,451
Is that some sorta joke?

368
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:58,853
ARCHER: A roll, then. Whatever.

369
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,688
CYRIL: Are you not
listening to me?!

370
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:01,889
MALORY: Well obviously not.

371
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:05,026
My God, how is there not one
picture of us together?

372
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:08,096
CYRIL: Krieger's father
was a Nazi scientist!

373
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,065
MALORY: And JFK's father
was a bootlegger.

374
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:14,802
CYRIL Wh-? That's like comparing
apples to... Nazi oranges!

375
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,204
MALORY: Oranges, exactly.

376
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:18,630
Do you like powdered orange
breakfast drink?

377
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,365
- No, not really.
- How about micro-wave ovens,

378
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,842
Neil Armstrong, hook and loop fasteners?

379
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:26,622
- Okay, you lost me.
- None of those things

380
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,784
would be possible without
the Nazi scientists

381
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,723
we brought back after World War II.

382
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:34,547
- The Nazis invented Neil Armstrong?
- Rockets,

383
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,577
which put him on the moon.

384
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,765
After the war ended we were snatching up

385
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:40,676
Kraut scientists like hot cakes.

386
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:44,419
You don't believe me? Walk into NASA
sometime and yell "Heil Hitler!".

387
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,831
They all jump straight up.
But, Cyril...

388
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,252
I know all about Dr. Krieger's origins.

389
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:53,216
And I also know that nobody
likes a tattle tale.

390
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:56,130
- Yes, Cyril.
- And if it's one thing I've learned

391
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,211
in all my years as a spy master
is that you keep your friends...

392
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,414
- ...close.
- Yeah, Cyril.

393
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:05,270
And possible genetic clones of Adolf Hitler

394
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,122
- ...closer.
- Yeah, Cyril.

395
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:09,214
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, what?

396
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:12,679
Oh, my God, it was you.

397
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,276
My 15th birthday... You...
You were at the compound.

398
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,294
When they finish, bring me the boy.

399
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,205
[ screaming ]

400
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:27,054
And then my pet dobermans
accidentally ate my father.

401
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,222
My father...
MALORY: Oh, Krieger...

402
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,411
Nothing's an accident.

403
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,913
PAM: Holy shitsnacks!

404
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,081
Krieger's one of the
boys from Brazil!

405
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,183
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh!

406
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,851
Oh my God, seriously, I'm sorry.

407
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,191
I think I need help or something.

408
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,587
PAM: No shit.

409
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,923
LANA: And one more crack about
"monster hands" and I promise

410
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,259
you that I will shoot your fat
Irish faces off I'm sorry, was that racist?

411
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:47,395
I'm not mad at you, I'm
sorry, I'm mad at Archer.

412
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:49,230
Thanks to him I've got
two perforated eardrums,

413
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:53,234
and I guess I've just been...
Getting hotboxed all day in my car!

414
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:56,370
Shit, which I'm trying to
sell, but fat chance now!

415
00:16:56,438 --> 00:17:00,107
Bet it smells like... weed...
and rampage...

416
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,330
Damn it, that is classic him!

417
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,355
You guys have any snacks?

418
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:05,238
ARCHER: Here.

419
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,483
This is good, right here.

420
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,061
DELANEY: For what, boyo?

421
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,550
We havin a picnic?

422
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:10,715
ARCHER: Oh my God
do you have snacks?

423
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:14,455
DELANEY: No.
What I have, is a plane to catch.

424
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:15,756
ARCHER: Yeah? To where?

425
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,925
Some bigger mansion somewhere
else you bought with the

426
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,961
profits from your
fake chemo drugs?

427
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,262
DELANEY: Pretty much, yeah.

428
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,031
So if you're gonna shoot me...
ARCHER: Oh don't worry,

429
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,166
I'm gonna shoot you.

430
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,734
DELANEY: No yer not.

431
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,436
You're an ISIS agent.

432
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,465
Ya got a sense of
honor, fair play.

433
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:32,006
What?

434
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:36,377
ARCHER: You obviously haven't seen
my movie "Terms of Emrampagement,"

435
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:39,080
hang on that was lame...
DELANEY: Ya killed my men, sure,

436
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:40,214
but they were armed.

437
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:42,709
I'm just a sick old
man in a wheelchair.

438
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,887
You can't do it, boy. I know you.
ARCHER: You don't know me!

439
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,322
DELANEY: I know you
better than yer muther...

440
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,947
Who I had for three
days, at Dûc Quay.

441
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:54,228
ARCHER: Can you, um, go
ahead and repeat that?

442
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,302
DELANEY: I said I had your mother
for three days at Dûc Quay.

443
00:17:57,422 --> 00:18:01,006
ARCHER: And was that uh, hopefully,
some sort of Vietcong prison camp?

444
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,337
DELANEY: Single's resort.
Phuket, Thailand.

445
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,306
Whole place ran on beads.

446
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:09,010
But lemme tell ya boyo,
that muther o' yers found a

447
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:11,145
whole new way to use 'em!

448
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,047
ARCHER: To use... the beads?

449
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:15,549
DELANEY: Oh yeah. Boop!

450
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:18,386
And then zzzzzziiiinnnng!

451
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:20,189
Like an SSP racer.

452
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,253
Good times.

453
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:24,692
Goodbye, Archer.

454
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,535
Tell yer muther to
gimme a call sometime.

455
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,238
ARCHER: Delaney?

456
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,936
DELANEY: Yes?

457
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,405
ARCHER: Did you see
Regis this morning?

458
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,745
DELANEY: Yes. Why?

459
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,372
DELANEY: Yes. Why?

460
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:02,196
MALORY: Oh for the love of...
ARCHER : Shut up! Shut up,

461
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,698
here it comes!

462
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:05,099
Booyakashaaaaa!

463
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,834
Right in the face!

464
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:09,337
I swear to God, I could
watch this a million times.

465
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,305
MALORY: I'd swear to
God we already have.

466
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:12,740
ARCHER: Well too bad, mother.

467
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:14,008
MALORY: Booyakashaaa!

468
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:14,709
Booyakashaaa!

469
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:16,577
ARCHER: Hey just because
he was your boyfriend...

470
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,979
MALORY: What, "boyfriend"?!

471
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:20,648
It was two weeks in Phuket,
anything goes over there.

472
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,683
PAM: Zzzzzziiiinnnng!

473
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,819
Ahem. Wildly inappropriate.

474
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:25,786
KRIEGER: Seriously, Pam.

475
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,235
PAM: Okay, Clone Wars.

476
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:28,404
KRIEGER: Zing.

477
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:29,584
ARCHER: And Mother, we had a deal.

478
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:33,227
I supply the mimosas and bagels and
lox, and you people shut up and

479
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:36,263
ingest them and watch
"Terms of Emrampagement."

480
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,385
LANA: Ugh...
ARCHER: Which, obviously, working title.

481
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:39,600
LANA: We have watched it!

482
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:42,303
CYRIL: Every Friday for
the past three months!

483
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,038
PAM: I'm not complainin...
ARCHER: See?

484
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:46,874
Twelve straight weeks and Pam's
still on Team Live Badass.

485
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,743
LANA: Yeah, and Team Live Badass?

486
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,578
That's the best you
could come up with?

487
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,380
ARCHER: Well, Lana, since
you already had dibs on

488
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,282
Team I Have An Oversized Vagina...
LANA: Hey shut up!

489
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,950
ARCHER: You shut up!

490
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:59,729
And everybody else shut up and
watch "Terms of Emrampagement!"

491
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,457
CYRIL: Why don't you
call it "Magnum P.U."?

492
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:05,860
ARCHER: It's a working title!
Idiots!

493
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:07,513
MALORY: Liked him better
when he had cancer...

494
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,583
ARCHER: First of all,
what the shit? ! Mother!

495
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:12,066
And second of all too bad,
because the doctor says

496
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,104
my cancer is in total remission.

497
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,951
Seriously, what is cancer?

498
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:19,407
So I'll probably never get any
sort of cancer again, ever.

499
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,076
So shut up and watch my movie.

500
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,644
For which I really
need a better title.

501
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:25,889
CHERYL/CAROL: How about
"Citizen Dickbag"?

502
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,669
"Snark Victory"?

503
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:30,954
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, I got it!

504
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,547
Casablampkin.

505
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:42,917
