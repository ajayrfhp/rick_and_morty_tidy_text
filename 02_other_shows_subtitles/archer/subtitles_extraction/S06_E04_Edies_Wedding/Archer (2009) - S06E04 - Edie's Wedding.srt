To don ekblad, jr.
Of all people,

Yeah, come on.
You comin'?

167
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,900
No, but hey,
I know it's late notice,
and I really hate to ask,

168
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,002
But would you mind
keeping a.J. For the--

169
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,437
What?
I'm hitting door open.

Oh, my god, it's just like
maximum overdrive.

On Monday

174
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,080
How scary

God dammit!
Let me go!

No, now just calm--
let me go!

[spits]
happy?

183
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,128
Less than I was,
to be honest.

184
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,763
When?
When you were chugging balls

185

Behind whatever
gay strip joint

186

Whoa.

188
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,635
Told ya,
it's that jacket.

189
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,170
First of all,
pam, shut up.

190
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,839
I'm not the one
who chugs balls

191
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,173
Behind buildings,

192
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,641
And even if I were,

193
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,977
They wouldn't belong
to that dude arn.

194
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,346
[laughs]

195
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,682
Oh god,
you told him about arn?

196
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,450
Arn didn't even
know she was alive.

197
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,952
Okay,
you know what?

198
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,987
Besides what arn's
balls taste like?

199
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,155
[laughs]

200

I--
ah! I am out of here.

201
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,061
Pam, wait!

202
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,662
[laughs]
wow,
and here I thought

203
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,865
She was kidding
about the pig's blood.

[laughs]
no...

205
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,571
It was--
it was calf's blood.

stupid, frickin' edie.

208
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,148
I'll show her
what arn's balls taste like.

209
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,816
Wait, what the?

00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,817
Barry?

211
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,452
Hey...

212
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,355
You.

213
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,556
[body thuds]

214
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,924
[lana]
hello?

215
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,025
Krieger?

216
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,360
You in here?

217
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,594
Hey, you!

218
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,063
What can I do you for?

219
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,433
So, hey, um,
archer totally flaked on me.

220
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,901
Mallory and ray
are being lame,

221
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,270
And cheryl is-- cheryl.

222
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,572
So I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

223
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,340
Yep, yep, yep,
but, first,

224
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,576
Who is this little person?

225
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,679
Um, a.J., my baby,

226
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,115
Who I've had for,
like, six months,

227
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,616
Who you've met.

228
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,851
Mm-kay.

229
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,619
Ooh, and who also
has a poopy diaper.

230
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,955
[gasps]
great bacchus plateau,

231
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,256
It works!

232
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,691
What? What does?

233
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,094
The k-9000
infrasonic pulse rifle.

234
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,562
What do you mean?
What does it do?

235
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,898
I assume you're familiar
with the brown note.

236
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,366
I am not, no.

237
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,268
What? The brown note,

238
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,636
The frequency
that makes humans

239
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,206
Shit their pants,
or their onesie.

240
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,641
[sighs]
I'm pretty sure
that was a coincidence.

241
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,277
That's what they said
about tesla's death ray.

242
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,313
So, this favor...

323
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,774
That way if you get anxious
about being away from her,

324
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,809
We're right there.

325
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,378
This is weird.

326
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,912
Why is this weird?

327
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,914
Because what kind
of sick bastard

328
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,883
Travels with duct tape
and rope?

329
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,418
No, we actually
made a couple of stops

330
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,886
While you were
knocked out.

331
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,988
Had to get more
tom for the collins--

332
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,556
Oh, and also
rob a gun store.

333
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,658
Wait, what?

334
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,293
Well, technically,
burgle.

335
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,627
How long was I out?

336
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,928
Mm... 20 minutes?

337
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,230
Dammit!

338
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,098
Yeah, that is not
good for you.

339
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,566
No,
turn around dick-nuts,

340
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,302
I can still make
the rehearsal dinner.

341
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,571
After we rescue pam.
Now, shut up.

342
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,640
Oh, and un-shut up
for a second.

343
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,075
Is this the way
to the grain elevator?

344
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,910
Ah... Oh, yeah,
right down that road.

345
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,412
Take a left.
Take a left!

346
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,649
Even for me,
that was pretty lucky.

347
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,419
Wa-hoo!

348
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,021
Rental car!

349
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,459
[barry]
there we go.
Looking good, barry.

350
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,194
Well, thanks,
other barry.

351
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,462
Archer comes in
to save her,

352
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,164
And boosh!

353
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,765
K-k-k-kill zone!

354
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,767
So you're just bug-nuts
crazy, huh?

355
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,338
[laughs]
crazy like a fox!

356
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,140
Who's bionic!

357
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,042
And, whose fiance
dumped him,

358
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,278
For literally
the dumbest guy in russia?

359
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Who want waffle?

360
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:14,018
I forget to make waffle.

361
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,220
Oh, and just so you know,
my worst nightmare,

362
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,022
Which is actually recurring,

363
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,391
Is me and santa claus
getting chased through the snow

364
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,194
By lurch
from the adam's family.

365
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,063
Uh, why did
you tell me that?

366
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,133
[laughs]
exactly.

367
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,207
[archer]
piece of shit rental.

368
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,043
[edie]
you drive like a...
Egg.

369
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,179
I-- no, I don't,
and also, shut up

370
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,148
Because right now
I'm going to explain

371
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,717
What cyborgs are,
and why they're a threat,

372
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,220
To our entire
way of life.

373
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,189
[cyril]
I mean, not now,
obviously.

374
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,657
But, someday.

375
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,859
Someday soon...

376
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,095
[snoring]

377
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,098
I am gonna
re-hit that.

378
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,101
Huh? Hm?

379
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,203
Hey, you.

380
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,605
Hello.

381
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:08,873
Wait.

382
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,241
Who's laws
of what's its?

383
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,777
Asimov's three laws
of-- look,

384
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,779
Never mind.
They don't even apply to barry

385
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,614
Because he's a frickin'
cyborg.

386
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,350
[barry, singsong]
archer...

387
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:23,087
Come out and play.

388
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,191
Ugh, and also
a gaping, prolapsed anus.

389
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,759
So, grain elevator.

390
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,428
Besides a place
to blow farmers,

391
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,462
What's the point?

392
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,464
To store grain,
dumbass.

393
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,900
Yeah, but you elevator
it way the hell up there,

394
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,936
Then-- wait, cows don't
go up there to eat it,

395
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,938
Do they?
Oh my god,
no!

396
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,909
It's gravity fed back down
to trucks and trains and shit.

397
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:45,976
Which are on the ground.

398
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,244
Yes!

399
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,879
See where I'm going
with this?

400
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,615
Why not make it horizontal,
so the cows can just walk up

401
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,250
And eat whenever?

402
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,886
So just a mile long trough
of grain getting rained on

403
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,954
All the damn time?

404
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,456
I-- well, no.

405
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,625
It would have like
a salad bar roof on it,

406
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,794
You idiot.

407
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,629
[barry]
said the dumb waiter.

408
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,264
Get it, archer?

409
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,668
As in, you're dumb,
and you dress like a waiter.

410
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,770
[pam]
told ya!
God dammit, pam,

411
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,972
This is exactly
what a man should wear to a--

412
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,342
Holy shitsnacks!
What the--
pam?

413
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,111
[sighs]
yeah, and just a heads up--

414
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,680
[growls]

415
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,681
[pam]
whoa!

416
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,916
Dammit, pam.

417
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,152
How about a--
oh, wait by heads up,

418
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,653
Did you mean--?

419
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,490
[grunting]

420
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,797
Seriously, barry,
why all the anger?

421
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,766
Because katya
broke up with me!

422
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,735
[laughs]

423
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,273
Too soon?

424
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,278
Edie, cut me down!

425
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,647
Oh, wow,
where to start?

426
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,550
Even in a new dress,
you look like ten pounds of shit

427
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,151
In a five pound bag.

428
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,521
The whole town thinks
you're a giant asshole

429
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,889
For moving to new york city.

430
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,892
You can just
say new york.

431
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,295
Oh, and dad was right,
you'll never find a husband

432
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,063
Unless you convince
a blind man

433
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,798
You're a seeing eye pig!

434
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,234
[cries]

435
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,538
I meant cut me down
from here!

436
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,039
Yeah. Duh.

437
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,643
But you know
you're no prize, right?

438
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,077
Excuse me?

439
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,045
He said--

440
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,180
[growling]

441
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,049
[laughs]

442
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,050
[thuds]

443
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,523
Archer! Do something!

444
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,158
Flower box.

445
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,226
Shot gun.

446
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,328
[grunts]

447
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,396
[thuds]

448
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,497
[pam]
ow.

449
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,032
[growls]

450
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,066
[gagging]

451
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,171
Hey, track suit,

452
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,575
If anybody's gonna choke
my sister's bitch neck,

453
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,276
It's gonna be me.

454
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,545
[laughs]
what are you doing?

455
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,681
What you got a little
shot gun? Huh?

456
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,282
Yeah,
remember right now?

457
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,618
When I'm a frickin'
cyborg?

458
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,454
[archer]
barry, just for you,

459
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,790
I got explosive ammo.

460
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,558
You what, now?

461
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,794
Jesus christ,
you could have killed me!

462
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,696
Shut up!

463
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,966
Huh, I mean,
I'm not a doctor,

464
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,233
Or, a robotisist,

465
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,936
But, uh,
that can't be good.

466
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,137
So, hey,
why don't we all do this--

467
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,205
[gunshot]

468
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,241
[archer]
oh, god.
Oh!

469
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,310
[machine voice]
forgot what I was gonna say.

470
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,048
[screams]

471
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,084
[objects crashing]

472
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,952
[scream continuing]

473
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,487
[body thuds]

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,693
[rattling]

475
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,465
So, thank you...

476
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,566
For?

477
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,001
Saving your life?

478
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,336
I thought you were
thanking me...

479
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,338
For dropping
those truth bombs.

480
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,741
What?
You'll never find a husband.

481
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:08,245
So, you really
think he's dead?

482
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,180
[archer, sighs]
only one way to be sure.

483
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,426
[edie]
hello? I'm sorry, what?

484
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,161
Shut up, no,
uh-uh. No!

485
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,163
What are you saying,

And increasingly impatient
for his bride-to-be's arrival
