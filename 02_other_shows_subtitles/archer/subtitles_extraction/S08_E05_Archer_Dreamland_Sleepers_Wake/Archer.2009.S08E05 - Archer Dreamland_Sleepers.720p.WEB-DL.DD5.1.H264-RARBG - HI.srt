00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,570
So, uh, what are we doing?

9
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,094
Are we just
jumping right into this,

10
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,548
or what's the deal?

Alrighty!
And how's our patient?

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,500
- And, follow up, where is our patient?
- (Meows)

15

- Meaning?
- (Meows)

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,500
Okay, you know what?

17
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:43,079
You're about as helpful
as tits on a...

18
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,600
- (yells)
- You!

19
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,864
- (Meows)
- Look what you've done to me!

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,614
(Hoarse voice): Yeah, right?
I'm a monster!

21
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:53,247
You're a miracle!
You didn't even have feet!

22
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,067
Now look at you,
walking around on new legs,

23
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:58,047
with hands
that can crush steel...

24
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:01,947
(high-pitched voice): And, I mean, don't
try it right now, obviously, but...

25
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:04,064
- (gasping)
- Look at me!

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,784
I'm a Goddamn freak!

27
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:08,589
And I don't know
who I'm gonna kill first,

28
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,954
you or that
son of a bitch Len Trexler.

29
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,251
Well, first of all,
it's "whom."

30
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,712
Uh, no, it isn't.

31
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,259
It absolutely is.
Doesn't matter.

32
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:18,204
But if it'll help you decide,

33
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,482
this serum, which is sort of
the key to the whole deal,

34
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,736
I call factor-K.

35
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,444
- And?
- And your body

36
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,844
will reject its new components,

37
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,243
and you will die in agony,

38
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:27,954
unless you get
an injection of it.

39
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,751
Wha... well,
give it here, shitbeard.

40
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,259
Uhh! Goddamn it.

41
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:35,431
Ow. Okay, that kind of hurt,

42
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:37,790
and I'm already
in a pretty bad mood,

43
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,603
so I'm gonna kill you first.

44
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,337
So, any last words?

45
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,267
Every 12 hours.

46
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:44,861
Cryptic. Nice.

47
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:46,829
Usually people just
blubber and beg,

48
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:49,665
and those big gloobs of snot
run outta their nose, but you...

49
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,797
if you don't get a shot
of factor-K every 12 hours,

50
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:53,977
you will die.

51
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,124
- Bullshit.
- Which... and that's fair,

52
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,084
- but...
- Let me guess.

53
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,234
You're only gonna make enough
for one injection at a time.

54
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,984
(Chuckling)
Well, I am now.

55
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,960
- Goddamn it! Yeah,
- So, like an insurance policy.

56
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:07,757
- How long does it take you to make it?
- I don't know. An hour?

57
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,700
Well, then, I guess I'll
wake you up in about 11 hours.

58
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,369
Wake me... (Grunts) (Body thuds)

59
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,423

Man, that thing

no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

(Muffled) All right.
I guess let him out.

81
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,236

(Coughing)

83

Aw, man!
Some of it got in my mouth.

84
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,377
(Scoffs)
How long was I in there?

85
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,736
How should I know?

86
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,694
Usually dead people don't just
climb out of these drawers

87
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,627
with their big bushy
birds on fire,

88
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,744

you're that Zombie

- that got walked with!
- That what?

90

I'm not a Goddamn...

92
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:13,362
I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis,
LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!

93
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,775
- I showed you my shield!
- And if you'd show it to me again...

94
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,682
I don't...
whoever hit me took it.

95
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,228
(Gasps) Goddamn it!
And my service weapon!

96
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,213
And yet they left you
your lighter.

97
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:26,244
Wait. When I got pistol-whipped,
I was talking to an English guy.

98
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,559
We don't have an English guy.

99
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,416
I... you have to remember me!

100
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,611
Uh, actually, I don't.
And also, I don't, so...

101
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:35,838
- Oh, you think you're pretty smart,
- Huh? I mean, smart enough to know

102
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,142
you cut a finger off one of my cadavers...

103
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,439
- which, ew.
- And also gross abuse of a corpse,

104
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:42,760
which is punishable by...

105
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,236
I know all about
gross abuse of a corpse!

106
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,307
- Yeah, that's kind of my whole point.
- (Growls)

107
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,549
As the lord our God himself
is my witness,

108
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,314
upon the conclusion
of my current business,

109
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,057
I shall return to this place

110
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,369
and visit upon you an apocalypse
of such terror and destruction

111
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:05,205
that you will rue... rue the very
fact of your miserable birth!

112
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,408
I'll be here.

113
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,783
I actually won't.
Well, unless it's before Friday.

114
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:15,408
Oh, yeah, that's right.
What's it you're leaving to do?

115
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,442
- Lumber inspector.
- Huh. Didn't know that was a thing.

116
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,377
That's because
you have no vision.

117
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:23,611
This, Danny...
(Sniffs) This is your world.

118
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,487
Yeah.

119
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,385
Please, Figgis, for your sake,
tell me you're joking.

120
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,723
<i>It's just a temporary setback,</i>

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,986
<i>but I am going to fix this,
trust me.</i>

122
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,416
That's the whole point.
I don't trust you.

123
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:38,346
I wouldn't trust you
to fix potato (Bleep) Salad!

124
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,831
You're probably
one of those assholes

125
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,463
who puts relish in it!

126
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,776
I mean, first my whores,
and now Charlotte Vandertunt?

127
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:49,216
<i>How many women can one man lose?</i>

128
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:50,932
Oh, plus your wife.
Would you...

129
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:53,024
Oh! Mr. Trexler,

130
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:56,611
I swear to God that I will
get you your million dollars.

131
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,665
<i>You know, you say that
with the confidence of a man</i>

132
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>who has a lot longer to live.</i>

133
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,572
I...
<i>(Click, dial tone)</i>

134
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,658
How'd that go?

135
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,291
How do you think it went?

136
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,705
- Not great.
- Ya think?

137
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,735
Yes.

138
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,315
Because while I was
getting pistol-whipped

139
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,932
and shoved in a drawer
at the morgue...

140
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,807
losing precious time, not to
mention my gun and my shield...

141
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,010
you were supposed to find
Charlotte Vandertunt.

142
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,783
And, so, how did that go?
(Pounds desk)

143
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,202
Also not great.
But more importantly...

144
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,096
because we know Archer
broke her out of jail,

145
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,002
and we know he's working
for mother, so...

146
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,211
Son of a bitch!

147
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,385
I bet she's gonna try
to ransom Charlotte!

148
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,822
Wait. Shut up.
"More importantly" what?

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,189
- What is that smell?
- What is what smell?

150
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:36,974
(Sniffs)
That. Smells like cuy.

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,560
- What the hell is cuy?
- Roasted Guinea pig.

152
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,119
- Huh?
- They blowtorch the

153
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:42,086
hair right off of it.

154
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,172
- It's like the national dish of Peru.
- (Sighs) Did...

155
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,837
- Or is it Ecuador?
- Did you...

156
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:48,291
which one's the native habitat
of the spectacled bear?

157
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,791
- Did...
- Wait. Shit. They both are.

158
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:53,491
Hang on. Uh, hey, let me
see your service weapon.

159
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,017
Huh? Yeah. Here.

160
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,689
Now, Peru has
the pisco sour, but...

161
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,174
Did you find
Charlotte Vandertunt?

162
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,745
Tell me before, so help me God,

163
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,353
I put a bullet in your
big fat stupid face!

164
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,346
(Clears throat) First of all,
that's just hurtful.

165
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,783
- (Gun cocks)
- And second of all,

166
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,158
it doesn't matter where she is,
just where the ransom money is.

167
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,314
Hmm. Presumably
with the Vandertunts.

168
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:16,454
So all we gotta do is...

169
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,924
insinuate ourselves
into this whole deal,

170
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,088
like we're there to help,

171
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,096
and steal the ransom
during the exchange.

172
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:23,575
Yeah. It's a piece of piss.

173
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,259
Now, aren't you glad
you didn't shoot me?

174
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,393
(Sighs) For now.

175
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:27,425
Although I'm sure at some point

176
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,033
I'll regret that decision, so...

177
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:30,283
why is there blood
on the barrel?

178
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,882
What? No.
That's, um, hot sauce.

179
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,383
Well, why is there
hot sauce on it?

180
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,313
With a couple of hairs
stuck in it.

181
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,735
- Oh, sweet Christ.
- What?

182
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,321
Did you beat a Guinea
pig to death

183
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:43,508
with your service weapon,

184
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,829
slather the thing
in hot sauce and eat it?

185
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:47,111
Yep!

186
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,055
Well, I officially regret
my decision.

187
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,844
(Chuckling)
Man, I almost always do.

188
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,204
(Gong bangs)
(Chattering in Chinese)

189
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:59,024
Hey! Who keeps leaving
the Goddamn seat down?

190
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,462
Looking your way, Huizhong.

191
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,404
(Poovey:) So, how are we gonna
play this with the Vandertunts?

192
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:11,629
We're gonna play it that
you keep your fat mouth shut...

193
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,027
- Again, hurtful.
- While I explain to them

194
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,503
that the cavalry
is finally here.

195
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,394
Yes, it's right here,
as per your demand...

196
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:21,684
a million dollars
in unmarked, untraceable

197
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,745
20, 50,
and 100-dollar bills.

198
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,546
Okay. Good. Good. That's...

199
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,738
<i>sheer idiocy on your part,
frankly.</i>

200
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,839
I'm sorry?
As well you should be.

201
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,777
- <i>What do you...</i>
- I mean, including the bag,

202
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:33,441
which, by the way, was a gift,

203
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,832
<i>the whole thing must weigh
a good 50 pounds.</i>

204
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:38,399
- Well, too bad. I...
- I mean, an envelope

205
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:41,324
with a hundred sammies
would've been so much easier.

206
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:43,021
- A hundred what?
- <i>Sammies.</i>

207
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,519
After Salmon P. Chase,

208
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:46,348
the man on the $10,000 bill?

209
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,332
Well, what the hell
am I supposed to do

210
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:50,019
with a $10,000 bill?

211
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:52,425
<i>Well, what does one do
with a twenty-dollar bill?</i>

212
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,329
- <i>Buy a single orange?</i>
- That's...

213
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:56,660
just make sure the money's
at the drop by midnight,

214
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,246
and that you follow
my instructions to the letter.

215
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,265
- Mmm, like a reverse scavenger hunt.
- <i>(Sighs)</i>

216
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:03,675
And once we have the money,

217
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,751
we'll arrange for the return
of your sister.

218
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,457
<i>Oh, right. Yes. Sorry.
I forgot that part.</i>

219
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,875
- <i>And that's a firm firm?</i>
- Yes.

220
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,377
And no cops, at all, anywhere.

221
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,309
No police.
Also a firm firm?

222
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:18,582
- <i>Yes, it's a firm firm!
- Wait. Why?</i>

223
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,637
What? I... I don't know.
No reason.

224
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,739
I'm sorry.
This is my first kidnapping.

225
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,176
<i>Well...</i> (In spooky
voice): Or is it?

226
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,485
(Evil chuckle)
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

227
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:30,098
<i>(Click, dial tone)</i> Ciao!
Alrighty, then.

228
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,075
Who's for cuy?

229
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,715
(Figgis yells, gags)

230
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:34,856
(Muffled gag)

231
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,426
(Sniffs)
Yes,

232
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,739
that's probably why
you smell burnt hair.

233
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,582
But don't judge them
by their looks.

234
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,870
They may seem appalling...
(Chomping)

235
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,918
But trust me,
they're quite delicious.

236
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,457
(In spooky voice)
Yes, delicious.

237
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,856
Like all taboos.

238
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,947
(Muffled):
You're frickin' weird.

239
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,442
- I mean, just weird.
- (Lana:) What is?

240
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,895
(Gasps)
Lana! Uh, I mean, Miss Kane.

241
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,379
I... I mean, uh...
"Lana" is fine.

242
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,264
- I'll say.
- You'll say what?

243
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,934
- Nothing.
- Ah. A man of mystery.

244
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,504
Well, you know,
mainly in the sense

245
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,036
that I try to solve them,
you know...

246
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,782
- On your own.
- Well, yeah.

247
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,028
I mean, since my partner died.

248
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,663
- Which I actually should really...
- I meant without the police.

249
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:17,927
Without the who now?

250
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,434
"No cops, at all, anywhere,"

251
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,504
I believe were your exact words.

252
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,590
My exac...
were you eavesdropping on me?

253
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,051
Yes.

254
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,989
Did you have a follow-up
to that, or...

255
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,028
no, actually,
because you caught me

256
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,093
totally off guard
by not denying it.

257
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:34,137
But how much of that
did you hear?

258
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,967
Depends.
What's your angle, shamus?

259
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,989
(Chuckling) Well, uh,
probably about 30 degrees.

260
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,739
(Rimshot) (Gillette:)
Diminishing returns, cliff!

261
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,817
But I'm not working
any angle, so...

262
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,278
So, then, you wouldn't
need any help?

263
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:50,496
- No, I... why are you so interested?
- No reason.

264
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,676
Just thought maybe you could
make it worth my while.

265
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:55,700
Well, I... I can't, so...

266
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:58,270
What if I made it
worth your while?

267
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,090
Umm...

268
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,512
No.

269
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,762
No what? Wait. What?

270
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,754
What? At the club,
I said, "umm,"

271
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,987
and then I was gonna say, "no,"

272
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,511
but then you didn't
let me finish.

273
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,974
- Oh, you finished, all right.
- Yeah. Maybe try woolite?

274
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,067
Which, by the way,
makes one of us!

275
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,150
- Oh, please! Wait. Seriously?
- Get out.

276
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,465
'Cause I'd be happy to,
you know...

277
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,181
- Get... (Chuckles)...
- St-stay and watch you finish.

278
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,143
- Out!
- Jesus!

279
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,413
Look, if you... ehh!

280
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,463
(Sighs)
Great.

281
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,042
Now I have no liquor.

282
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:36,171
Just a big fat pair
of blue lady-balls.

283
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,656
(Speaking German)
(Meows, purrs)

284
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,156
(Spits, groans) That's my mouth!
(Whining)

285
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,354
Get outta here!
(Spits) Oh!

286
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:49,478
(Spits) If I wanted your
asshole on my mouth,

287
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,890
I'd do it while you were asleep!

288
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,290
Which we've never
talked about, but... ow!

289
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,171
My face!
How long was I out?

290
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,142
(Meows)
Oh, that helps.

291
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,960
Man, I gotta warn Trexler
Dutch wants to kill him.

292
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:03,601
Mainly because Trexler
hasn't paid me for my work yet,

293
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,116
but... also because...

294
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,656
say what you will about
der robotik ubermenschen.

295
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,601
Sure can punch good.

296
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,765
(Man laughing)
I'm sorry, darlin',

297
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,531
but you're gonna
have to repeat that.

298
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,054
(Clears throat)
I said,

299
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,273
"I had a little towel,

300
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,476
"but I lost it walking here,

301
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,460
so I need your clothes,
your boots,

302
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:25,671
and your motorcycle."

303
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,439
(Laughter)
Oh, is that all?

304
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,937
Yeah.
That oughta do it.

305
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:33,148
You, uh, sure you don't need me
to, uh, check your oil?

306
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,346
(Laughter)

307
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,171
Oh, okay.
And by that remark,

308
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,851
I assume you're referring
either to my robotic limbs

309
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,522
or offering to plunge
your finger,

310
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,601
and/or penis, into my anus.

311
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:47,413
(Men) Ohhh! I'll plunge
my fist into your...

312
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,366
(chuckles)
Were you gonna say "anus"?

313
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,525
(Bones crack)
(Screaming)

314
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,203
'Cause a finger's one thing.

315
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,156
- But a whole fist?
- Aaahhh!

316
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,109
That's like...
(Yelling)

317
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:57,952
I just never understood that.

318
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,843
(Crying out)

319
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,351
And I'm not trying to judge.
(Grunting)

320
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:05,773
But it's like, at some point,
you gotta question your choices.

321
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,132
(Yells)

322
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,687
Whoo!

323
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,187
I don't know. If it's two
consenting adults, (Zipper zips up)

324
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:19,922
I'm like,
"live and let live."

325
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,993
But if you want me
to let you live, chief,

326
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,304
I'm gonna need those keys.

327
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,601
Here. (Whimpers)
Take 'em!

328
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:26,945
Hey, thanks.

329
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,632
Oh, and if turns out
you lose that arm,

330
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,148
just give me a call.

331
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,224
(Chuckles)
I got a guy.

332
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:34,562
He what?

333
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,312
- Uh, is going to kill you.
- Was I not...

334
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:39,205
<i>what are you talking about?</i>

335
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:40,695
- <i>Why?</i>
- Stop it!

336
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,695
What, I should be calm
when you tell me

337
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,124
a Goddamn robot
wants to kill me?

338
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,535
<i>No, not you.</i>
Wha... wha... then who?

339
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:50,390
No. Sorry. You.
He wants to kill you.

340
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,210
The good news is,
without my help,

341
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,299
he'll be dead in...
Ten hours.

342
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,620
<i>Okay, well,
my house is a fortress.</i>

343
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,726
<i>I got a ton of guys.
We'll outlast him.</i>

344
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:01,002
Yeah. You say that...

345
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,285
Feels pretty good, huh, Dutch?
(Chuckles)

346
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:09,601
Yes, it does, other Dutch.
Yes, it does.

347
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:17,854
(Sighs)
Goddamn it.

348
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,523
(Mother:)
I think you're confused, doll.

349
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,773
(Charlotte:)
I am not in the least confused!

350
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:29,335
I don't care if my family
does pay the ransom.

351
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,671
I'm not going back there!

352
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,867
I meant you were confused
about me caring

353
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:34,484
what you did after the payoff.

354
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,027
You're not planning
to blindfold me

355
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,154
and hide me in a bomb shelter

356
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,215
with limited oxygen
and send my family cryptic notes

357
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:42,007
about how to find me in a race
against time for my life?

358
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,679
Who are you, collective
pseudonym Carolyn keene?

359
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,098
What? Who would go
to all that trouble?

360
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,921
Johann schmidt,
aka the red skull,

361
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,703
in my Nazi
Kidnap-Slash-Rape fantasy.

362
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,109
- (Growls)
- Ew!

363
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,898
Right?
Shut up.

364
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,046
Look, tonight your brother
is going to drop

365
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,445
the ransom money
at the Griffith observatory.

366
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,752
Archer is going to retrieve it
and bring it to me.

367
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,609
And if nobody screws up,

368
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,281
once I have the money,
you're free to go.

369
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,195
Well, but that's my whole point.

370
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,148
(Sobs)
Go where?

371
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,406
- (Growls)
- Who knows? Maybe a handsome

372
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,968
- young Nazi scientist will take you in.
- (Door opens)

373
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:20,163
- Do what now?
- (Gasps) What the hell are you doing?

374
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,828
Just filling
the coolers with ice.

375
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,928
You know,
normal bartendery stuff.

376
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:26,109
Oh, so suddenly

377
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,404
you work here again? - I...

378
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,390
- What happened to your face?
- I...

379
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:31,472
- Did someone catch you snooping?
- (Zerk growls)

380
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,085
Uh, no, I walked into a door...
Repeatedly.

381
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:37,187
Oh, yeah.
My mother used to do that.

382
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,274
Well, you better not have been

383
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,828
snooping on me, mister.

384
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,546
Are you... pfft! Come on!
I wouldn't do that!

385
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:47,443
(Quietly:) So, Archer's the
bagman for a kidnapping, huh?

386
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:49,585
Okay, then.

387
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,976
Because you know
what happens to snoops.

388
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:55,851
- They get... poops?
- What?

389
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:57,703
(Cecil:)
It's just that the kidnappers

390
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,898
were extremely clear
on that point.

391
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,265
No police, at all, anywhere.

392
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:05,881
Well, of course they're gonna
say that, but trust me...

393
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,187
I trust him.
He brought me a finger.

394
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:09,390
(Chomping)

395
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:11,726
(Sighs) Only you. What?

396
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:14,820
All I had today was some cuy.
(Gulps)

397
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,359
Oh, and congee.

398
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,757
Oh, and a bunch
of salted duck eggs.

399
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,953
Look, we'll be right behind you,

400
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,718
so just follow
their instructions,

401
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,795
drop the ransom off,
and with a bit of luck,

402
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:26,656
we'll get it and the kidnappers.

403
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:30,546
Okay, but I have a bad feeling about this.
(Engine starts)

404
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:32,273
Well, I don't care.

405
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:35,218
Hmm. Fair enough.

406
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,812
Do you wanna go?
(Belches)

407
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:43,007
(Hot dog thuds)

408
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,388
(Archer:) I thought I made it
pretty clear to the little weirdo

409
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:47,859
that I didn't wanna see any cops
near the drop.

410
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,195
I guess you can't
blame the guy for trying.

411
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,281
Plus, it's not like I can't
handle Figgis and Poovey.

412
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,492
But I may have to wait them out.

413
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:57,671
Whatever.
You paid for an hour.

414
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,060
Well, that's my whole point.

415
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,898
It may take a lot longer
than an hour...

416
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:02,867
well... and I'm not
paying you any extra.

417
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,388
- What?
- But feel free to hike the five miles

418
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,371
back to sunset in those heels.

419
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:12,413
What the hell?
Who brings a hooker?

420
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,215
(Cecil) (Quietly): Okay. Here's the topiary
garden. (Car door opens, closes)

421
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,288
Which I wish I could buy it so
I could burn it to the ground.

422
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,976
Topiary.
My God, what rubbish.

423
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,376
Shrubbish!
(Laughs)

424
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:30,937
So freakin' weird.
(Cecil:) Hmm.

425
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,515
Well, I suppose
that looks like a mushroom.

426
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,242
What? It's clearly
a mushroom.

427
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,656
Well, then...
(Grunts)

428
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:41,335
(Loudly):
All right, then. I'm off.

429
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:46,684
Alone, as I arrived,
with no police anywhere!

430
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,859
(Sighs)
I mean...

431
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:48,984
Seriously.

432
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,208
Okay, Archer.
It's your move.

433
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,288
(Car engine starts) Damn it.
I gotta at least tip her.

434
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,432
This is definitely gonna take
longer than an hour. (Car departs)

435
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,096
Man, I wish I had a...

436
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:00,708
Smoke grenade?
What the shit?

437
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:03,720
(Poovey) (Coughing):
Goddamn it!

438
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:04,974
(Figgis:)
Will you come on?

439
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,880
No, no, no, no, no, no!

440
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,318
- God... Damn it!
- (Car departs)

441
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:13,242
(Sighs)
I guess it's not his move.

442
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,305
- (Engine starts)
- (Screams) Jesus!

443
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,953
Sorry. Here. Take these.

444
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:19,444
What the hell are these for?

445
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,083
Um, I guess, parting gifts?

446
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,461
What? I don't know. Maybe you
can sell 'em or whatever.

447
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,375
Because, listen, this car chase
is gonna get a little crazy...

448
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:28,667
well, then, let me out!
Stop the car!

449
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:30,664
Let me finish!
Because my point is,

450
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,096
I don't really
have time to stop.

451
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,260
(Screaming)
But I'm not gonna have that,

452
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,879
so I'm gonna need you
to kind of jump out.

453
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,467
Are you nuts? I'll slow
down a little, obviously,

454
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:40,461
but when you hit the
ground, (Screams)

455
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:42,137
You're gonna wanna kind of roll.

456
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,589
(Grunts)
(Body thudding)

457
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:46,652
Yeah, just like that!
Good instincts!

458
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:50,461
Asshole!

459
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:52,281
Seriously!

460
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,232
(Figgis:) They're gaining on us!
Step on it!

461
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,610
Trust me,
it's totally stepped on!

462
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,649
Oh, son of a...
(Cocks gun)
