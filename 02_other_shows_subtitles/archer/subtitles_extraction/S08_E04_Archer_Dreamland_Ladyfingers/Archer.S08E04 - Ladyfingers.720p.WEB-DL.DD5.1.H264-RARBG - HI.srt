(Sniffs)

00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,514
So, uh, what are we doing?

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,812
- Are we just...
- Do you not see

5
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:18,121
the phone to my ear?

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,554
- I... I do, but...
- What?

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,975
- I said, I...
- You think this is some sort of joke?

8
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,632
Maybe the one
about the interrup...

9
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,897
- Ting cow?
- Moo!

10
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:26,374
- Shut up. Look, I...
- (Growls)

11
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:29,022
Listen, you had just
better put Mr. Vandertunt

12
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,991
on the line this instant!

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,507
Well, then, go find him.
(Gasps)

14
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:35,436
Oh. Well, then...

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,835
Hello? Ass!

16
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,938
Apparently that was
your brother.

17
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,218
- What?
- Cecil?

18
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:42,889
- (Growls loudly)
- (Growls)

19
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:44,593
- Seriously.
- And let me guess...

20
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:46,413
- He...
- let me guess!

21
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:47,931
He said he didn't believe that
I'd been kidnapped.

22
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,264
Yes, he...

23
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,366
Has this happened before?

24
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,518
No. I don't know.

25
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:55,600
- Well, he...
- Hey, do you need me for this?

26
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:57,063
- Yes!
- Because I've been awake...

27
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,223
for, like, three days.

28
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:01,586
- Your point being?
- I desperately need sleep?

29
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:04,847
- You can sleep when you're dead.
- It may literally come to that.

30
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:07,293
Because Len Trexler is
going to be left holding

31
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:10,027
a very empty bag on this.

32
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:11,355
And to make that happen,

33
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,566
I need you to drive out
to Vandertunt castle

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,332
and convince the old man
I'll mail her home

35
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:18,558
in several different boxes.

36
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,504
- (Growls)
- But not really,

37
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,277
though, right? Well...

38
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,902
- No!
- Well...

39
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:25,507
Look... (Yawns) I can't drive

40
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:27,613
way the hell out there
without some sleep. I...

41
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:28,941
(singsongy)
I have Dexedrine.

42
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,816
- Ah, and the universe provides.
- (Pills rattle)

43
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,433
(Pills crunching)
Okay, so,

44
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:35,675
once I'm out there,

45
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:38,379
how am I supposed to convince
Vandertunt you're serious?

46
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:39,988
Take him a finger.

47
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:42,722
- Huh?
- But not one of mine, though, right?

48
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:44,011
- No!
- Well...

49
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,098
I'm not taking him
anybody's finger.

50
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,066
- I'm just trying to save you a trip.
- How...

51
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,566
I mean, you don't want
to drive all the way

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,300
out there just to have him say,

53
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,441
"On second thought,
to make this happen,

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,894
we're going to need a finger."

55
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,579
Nobody has ever said,

56
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,097
"to make this happen,
we're going to need a finger."

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,754
Oh, you'd be surprised.

I never even see

So I am not

Oh. Yeah. Maybe.

00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,067
Wonder what they were after.

81
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:27,991
Who knows? Maybe some poor
dumb bastard broke in here

82
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:30,825
to steal back the photos
of his cheatin' wife gettin'...

83
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,684
(Clears throat)
Sorry.

84
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,551
- Why...
- I was gonna say "flap-hammered."

85
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,005
Why do you constantly
bring that up?

86
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:39,442
- What, Archer hammering your wife?
- Yes!

87
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,102
- In her flaps?
- Yes!

88
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,431
- (Muffled audible shrug)
- (Sighs) Okay.

89
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,338
Well, we're not gonna
find any clues to lead us

90
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,369
to Charlotte vandertunt
in this dump, so let's...

91
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,396
yeah. There's no telling
where she is.

92
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,982
(Mock gasp) And if<i> we</i> don't
know where she is?

93
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:54,568
It's... frustrating?

94
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,181
No. Then nobody
knows where she is.

95
00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,193
Uh-huh.
Including her father!

96
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:01,357
Yep.

97
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,346
Which means we can just tell him

98
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,763
we kidnapped her,
collect the ransom ourselves,

99
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,271
and then pay off Trexler!

100
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,204
Ohh. Okay. Yeah.

101
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:13,568
But on some level, it's
gotta be pretty frustrating.

102
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,935
Not as frustrating as you!

103
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:17,764
In the meantime,

104
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,967
she was at Dreamland
with Archer the other night.

105
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,048
<i>(Line ringing)</i> So go snoop around,
see if you turn up anything.

106
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,482
(Chuckling) Besides a cold
brewski, am I right? Hello?

107
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,857
Yes, Vandertunt castle, please.

108
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,850
Damn it, I don't care
if the number's unlisted!

109
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,193
This is a police emergency!

110
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:34,367
Thank you.

111
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,482
- That worked?
- Why are you still here?

112
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:39,537
Yes. Hello, this is, uh...

113
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,717
(clears throat)
Uh, ze kidnapperz.

114
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,020
(Wheezy, gravelly voice)
Please hold the wire.

115
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,955
I apologize for the heat.

116
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,532
It's positively tropical
in here.

117
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,584
But that's how father
prefers it.

118
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,461
Can he hear us?

119
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,525
Oh, yes.
He's just being rude.

120
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,131
(Loudly:) Father, say hello
to Charlotte's kidnapper.

121
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,271
No, no...
I-I-I didn't kidnap her.

122
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,857
I'm just sort of
a go-between.

123
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:11,303
A fine distinction,
legally speaking.

124
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:13,193
I know, but look,
I'm just trying to make sure

125
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:14,217
she gets home safely.

126
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,677
In exchange
for one million dollars.

127
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,185
According to the person,
or persons,

128
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:20,857
who asked me to
deliver the message.

129
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,912
Whom I'm sure
she's boring senseless

130
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:25,420
with her constant raving
about incest.

131
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:28,312
- Uh, I wouldn't know about that.
- Oh, it's when, uh...

132
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,506
- I know what it is.
- (Quietly) Did you know it's forbidden?

133
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,013
Everybody knows it's forbidden.

134
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,201
- Oh, you'd be surpri...
- Yes, Pelham?

135
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:37,279
(Wheezy, gravelly whispering)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

136
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:40,513
Ohh. Mm-hmm!

137
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:43,217
Yes, I think a finger
should suffice.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,771
Oh, is he taking drink orders?

139
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:47,553
'Cause I could go for a couple
of fingers of old buncombe.

140
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:51,482
- Like, a whole handful.
- At 7:00 A.M., you care for bourbon.

141
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,315
- Deeply.
- Very well.

142
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:57,365
Finish your call, Pelham, and
then Mr. Archer needs a drink.

143
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,912
I hate to say "need."

144
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,415
- Well...
- Yeah.

145
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:03,742
Pelham has had the most
interesting telephone call.

146
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,388
Tell me, Mr. Archer,
does, or do,

147
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:10,706
your person, or persons, possess
an accent vaguely Germanic?

148
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,934
That's pretty confusing, but no.

149
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,895
Most confusing, yes,
because such a person

150
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,614
is on the telephone just now,

151
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,434
claiming that<i> he</i>
is the kidnapper.

152
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,923
"He"? I mean, what?
Th-that's impossible.

153
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,040
Yes, even Charlotte
isn't stupid enough

154
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:29,126
to get herself kidnapped by two
different kidnappers at once.

155
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,415
Well... which means
one of you is lying.

156
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:35,151
So I'm afraid I shall
have to ask for proof

157
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,650
you actually have Charlotte.

158
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:39,487
What kind of... wait.
Oh, no.

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,870
Yes. I'm afraid
I require... a finger.

160
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,532
I-I could bring you her.

161
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,893
Just drive by the house.
She can wave to you.

162
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:50,722
Mmmmmmmmmmm, no.

163
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,191
I... that's...

164
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,324
then how about a photo of her
holding today's newspaper?

165
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,308
- Mmmm, well, now, that could work.
- Yeah, it's...

166
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:01,471
just make sure that she's
holding the newspaper

167
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,715
with nine fingers.

168
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,410
Aw, goddamn it.

169
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:06,027
Well, actually seven.
What?

170
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,152
You know,
not counting her thumbs.

171
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,027
And then, obviously,
bring me her severed finger

172
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,168
and the photograph
so that I may compare the two.

173
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,277
(Sighs)
Yeah. Um, obviously.

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,574
Father, say good-bye to

175
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,475
Charlotte's ostensible
kidnapper!

176
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:22,824
(Sighs) So I guess that's
a no on the bourbon?

177
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,152
Yes. Good-bye.

178
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:29,137
(Sighs) Where the hell am I
supposed to find a finger?

179
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:31,543
Hello? Hello?

180
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:34,605
Hey, listen to me.
Whoever you are,

181
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,990
and whatever this whole thing
is, I don't want it.

182
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,637
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

183
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:43,230
- Well, too bad, because...
- because you're getting it,

184
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,993
whether you want it or not.

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,457
So, let's get to it, shall we?

186
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,347
No. Look... look, listen.

187
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:57,871
I didn't know, okay?

188
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,316
I thought
this was gonna be, like,

189
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,316
some pull-on fake feet, man,
not... not...

190
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,677
Oh, sweet Jesus Lord God Christ,

191
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,301
not some freaky metal
robot legs!

192
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,324
(Meows)
That'll do, Schnuckiputzi.

193
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:13,277
(Meows) And also, it's
not just the legs.

194
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,991
No, you crazy kraut bastard,

195
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,926
I don't want any part
of those parts!

196
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,215
- But your employer, Mr. Trexler, does.
- It's not his body!

197
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,199
Look, I'm just following orders.

198
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,691
What? That's what
the Nazis said!

199
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:27,308
Okay, yeah, tell<i> me</i> about Nazis.

200
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:33,535
(Slurred)
What is taking so long?

201
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,188
(Speaking German)

202
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,610
(Meows)

203
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,302
I said, that will do!

204
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,489
(Purring)

205
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,029
(Slurping)

206
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,523
Mmm.

207
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,138
Mmm. What a load of shit.

208
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,950
I should be looking
for my partner's killer,

209
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,732
but instead I'm looking
for a damn finger.

210
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,927
(Tires screeching)
(Belches)

211
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,193
(Gulps, belches)

212
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,450
(Hot dog thuds)

213
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:35,779
(Poovey grunts)
(Body thuds)

214
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:38,333
(Body being dragged)

215
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:40,396
(Sawing)
(Krieger humming)

216
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,621
(Humming)

217
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,181
(Sawing stops)
(Humming stops)

218
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,715
(Sawing resumes)
(Humming resumes)

219
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,135
(Sighs)

220
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,989
(Speaking German)

221
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,372
(Air-raid siren in distance)

222
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,481
(Sighs)

223
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,285
(Sighs)

224
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,380
Well,

225
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:16,200
- I hate to say I told you so.
- Do you?

226
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,872
No. It's one of the few
great pleasures in life.

227
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,044
- Hang on. Do you live in here?
- No, you ass!

228
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:25,051
I live in the ten-room
Penthouse Apartment upstairs.

229
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,628
Oh.
You don't happen to have

230
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,536
a bunch of surplus fingers
up there, do ya?

231
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,325
- What do you think?
- Honestly?

232
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,451
Hardy-har-har.

233
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,762
If you need a finger,
just take one.

234
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,911
But... no, I'm not
cutting off her...

235
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,301
(Snoring loudly)

236
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,946
Man, that septum
is deviated, huh?

237
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:42,544
That's not her.

238
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,340
- (Archer:) Poovey?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:47,540
Tried to break into the club
first thing this morning.

240
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:51,122
I assume looking for
drooling beauty over there.

241
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:54,122
Yeah, you really threw a monkey
wrench into figgis' plan.

242
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,419
- His plan?
- Yeah, to ransom her off.

243
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,746
- Why?
- Wh... to pay back Trexler.

244
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,137
- For what?
- What are you...

245
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,333
for the sex slaves
trexler was gonna...

246
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,067
Oh, I get it!

247
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,395
- Do you?
- You're saying this is all my fault.

248
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,409
- Isn't it?
- I... look, this whole fiasco started

249
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:11,348
because I came to you for help!

250
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:13,505
- Exactly.
- Whose fault is that?

251
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,389
Son of a... that is so...

252
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,747
so now I gotta go
find a goddamn finger?

253
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:21,364
And if I were you, I'd take one
of her rings to put on it.

254
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,317
They say the devil's
in the details.

255
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,007
- And silk pajamas.
- What?

256
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:26,770
Get up, you lummox!
Huh?

257
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,508
Wuzza... what the...
Archer?

258
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:31,294
Get up, dummy.
We gotta go.

259
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:34,137
You better pray to God
it wasn't you who hit me,

260
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:35,973
because whoever it was...

261
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:39,431
Hits like a weak
little bitch of a girl,

262
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:42,692
who was born with some kind of
little bitch of a birth defect,

263
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,411
so that instead of a fist,

264
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,755
she just has this tiny
little bitch of a...

265
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:49,801
Nubbin.

266
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:54,304
And I guess I'll drive, since
you clearly have a concussion.

267
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,538
Yeah, not feeling great.

268
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,555
(Smacking lips)

269
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:02,919
(Gulps)
Ahh.

270
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,528
You know you're
killing me, right?

271
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,028
Sorry, are you talking to me,

272
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,333
or just meat-stuffed
intestines in general?

273
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,512
Figgis is counting
on that ransom money.

274
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,840
- I can't double-cross him again.
- Why not?

275
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,048
Because if he finds out,

276
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,220
somebody's gonna find me
in a hole in the desert.

277
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,317
- (Laughs) No, they're not.
- Exactly!

278
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,092
Look, it's your own fault
for doing right

279
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,614
by all those Chinese broads.

280
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,606
- Pfft! Talk about no good deed.
- It was a good deed.

281
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,247
And now I need you to help me
do another good deed.

282
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
Defraud an old man
out of a million dollars

283
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
using a severed human finger.

284
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,645
And reunite a family.

285
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,450
Of daughter
and sister-bangers.

286
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,652
<i>Alleged</i> daughter
and sister-bangers.

287
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:38,856
(Sighs)

288
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:43,063
(Muffled)
Well, let's go to the morgue.

289
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,216
That's the spirit.
(Gulps)

290

00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,248
(Man:)
Excuse me?

293
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,849
I said,
I'm looking for a corpse.

294
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:54,990
White, female, mid-30s,
fresh,

295
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,865
within, say, the last 12 hours.

296
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,927
Jesus Christ, every full moon.

297
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,145
Beat it, ya sicko,
before I call the cops.

298
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:04,548
I am the cops, asshole!
I'm working a missing persons!

299
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:06,396
Well, maybe lead with that, huh?

300
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,638
Just buzz me in, ya hump.
(Door buzzing)

301
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,810
(Gulps, belches)
Archer: Jesus Christ.

302
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,373
- What is it, national hot dog day?
- No.

303
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,334
- There isn't one.
- Yet!

304
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:21,802
- Can you...
- Oh, right. LAPD. We're looking for a...

305
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:23,638
missing persons, yeah.
White female, 30s,

306
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:24,990
brand-newly deceased.

307
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,732
Your jerk-off partner's
already back there.

308
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:27,756
(Sighs)
Our what?

309
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:30,591
Eyeglasses, dark hair,
gray at the temples,

310
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,217
mouth like somebody
used a tomato capper

311
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:35,071
to scoop out a pig's asshole
and glued it under his nose?

312
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,392
Aw, shit!
(Door buzzing)

313
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,186
Are you nuts?

314
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,928
- Do you wanna get caught?
- We're not gonna get caught.

315
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,904
Now shut up, put these on,
and follow my lead.

316
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,529
Aw, jeez.
He's really doing it.

317
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,974
(Sighs)
Sorry, lady.

318
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,613
But if you think about it,
which I guess you can't,

319
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:58,383
this whole thing
is Archer's fault, so...

320
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,985
(Muffled gag) (Whispering):
Will you get in position?!

321
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,277
(Quietly)
Okay! Jesus!

322
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,349
Okay. Jesus.

323
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:07,670
On one, two...

324
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:09,545
Ohhhh...

325
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,873
(Crunch)
(Disgusted groaning)

326
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,499
(Archer:) (With English
accent): Great Scott! Wha...

327
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,498
don't you move, you sick bugger!

328
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,084
No... no, no... this...
this isn't... I-I can explain.

329
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,607
You're damn right you will...
to the bobbies!

330
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:22,599
By which I mean the police!

331
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,802
I<i> am</i> the police.

332
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,157
Well?

333
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,763
Well, whaaa...

334
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:30,546
Holy shit!
I can't believe I did that!

335
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,959
I can't believe
it took you so damn long.

336
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,771
- What, are you hourly?
- Pfft!

337
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:36,396
(Muffled): No. Wh...

338
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:38,045
where the hell did you get that?

339
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,857
It was just sitting there.

340
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,365
That could've been
inside somebody.

341
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,232
(Muffled grunting)

342
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:46,998
(Gulps, sighs)

343
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,716
Well, it is now.

344
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,334
(Belches)

345
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,506
(Archer:) Anything.
Whatever. A little box.

346
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,560
(Poovey:) Aren't we supposed
to put it in milk?

347
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,677
But... that's for a tooth, dummy,

348
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,240
<i>if</i> you're gonna put it
back<i> in</i> somebody.

349
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,451
Yeah, that makes more sense.

350
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:06,935
Now, what are we gonna
do about him?

351
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,006
(Chuckles) I actually have
some thoughts on that.

352
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:12,327
He'll freeze to death in there!

353
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:14,974
No, he won't. I'll call them in,
like, half an hour.

354
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,015
- Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

355
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:20,240
(Chuckling)
Strip him.

356
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,084
Really wish we hadn't
have done that.

357
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,278
I can never unsee him naked.

358
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,637
I mean, the size of that thing.

359
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,106
Hollow that big bastard out,

360
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,848
you could use it
for an umbrella stand.

361
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,207
Ugh!

362
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,778
- Goddamn it!
- What?

363
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,129
(Cecil:) Oh, I suppose
I'm just surprised.

364
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,035
Why? You said
you wanted her finger,

365
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,215
so, you know, here's her finger.

366
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,973
It's really in there?
See for yourself.

367
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,465
Mmmmmmmmmm, no.

368
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,574
I'm sorry?

369
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,989
- I trust you. Unless...
- What?

370
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,746
(Shouting):
Father, do you wanna see

371
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:59,637
Charlotte's ostensible
severed finger?

372
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:00,942
No. We're good.

373
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,832
Are you...
this could be anything!

374
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,543
It could be a piece
of a hot dog!

375
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,200
- Eww!
- Don't you start!

376
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,559
You say it's her finger,
I take you at your word.

377
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,607
And I assume
you'll be in touch shortly

378
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,028
with complicated instructions

379
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,051
for the exchange of the ransom
money for my horrible sister?

380
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,645
I mean...

381
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:17,785
Mother:
<i>Good.</i>

382
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,793
- Then it's all settled.
- Yeah. Uh, I guess.

383
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:24,481
I'll expect the ransom within 24
hours, so you'll see to that.

384
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,155
But... and then you're
gonna help me find

385
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:27,575
my partner's killer, right?

386
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,942
All in good time,
Mr. Archer.

387
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,582
Right.
(Charlotte inhales deeply)

388
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,981
(Yawns)

389
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:35,887
Is it just me...
(Sniffs)

390
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,896
Or does it smell like finger?

391
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,625
(Device ratcheting)
(Vital signs monitor beeping)

392
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,192
(Sighs)
Almost there.

393
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,004
So close.

394
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,212
(Distant explosions)

395
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,770

396
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,485
(Sighs)

397
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,068

398
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:21,255
(Sighs)

399
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,085

00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,007

418
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,745
for the cuddles, huh?

419
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,651
Okay, I gotta get some sleep.

420
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:25,230
You be a good girl.
Who's a good girl?

421
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,112
Yeah, you're a good girl.
