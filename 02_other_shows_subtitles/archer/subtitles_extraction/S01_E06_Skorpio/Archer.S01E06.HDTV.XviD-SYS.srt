1
00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:03,608
So I get to go to the French riviera on the isis dime

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:04,442
To do what, exactly?

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,044
Locate a stolen shipment of redeye missiles and

4
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:11,339
Kill the arms dealer trying to Sell them -- spyridon skorpio.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,783
....Is diabetes busy?

6
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:14,792
Don't underestimate scorpio.

7
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,858
There's a reason the bounty on him is so high.

8
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,752
Like high enough to redo my kitchen?

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,240
Ugh! What did I tell you?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,679
That saltillo tile is terrible for a kitchen because it's so porous.

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,641
And mexican whorehouse-y.

12
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:27,848
So I'm sure your cook feels at home.

13
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:28,835
Hey, pita isn't a whore!

14
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,079
Not until you got ahold of her.

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,450
First of all -- oh, shut up!

16
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,192
The bounty on scorpio is more than enough for a new kitchen.

17
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,763
I also have the nook, though, so --

18
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:40,361
And the rest you can set aside for pita's inevitable medical expenses.

19
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:42,262
Oh, like, one time that happened!

20
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,914
It's pretty late, though. Why don't you, uh, take a cab?

21
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,774
Mr. Sterling? I have problem.

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,919
I'll pay for it.

23
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,849
Again?

24
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:52,194
Seriously, pita.

25
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,026
You're killing me here. Again?!

26
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,307
This was, uh, supposed to be coconut shrimp.

27
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,779
One, three times.

28
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,156
But it's the pope's fault she won't let me wear a condom.

29
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,026
Why don't you wear a vasectomy?!

30
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,888
This again? Don't you want a grandkid?

31
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:07,456
Well, if I did, I'd just scrape all your previous

32
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,551
Mishaps into a big pile and knit a onesie for it.

33
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,152
Jesus christ!

34
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,266
Sorry, I've been fasting, and I'm edgy.

35
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,498
Still, though. Sterling!

36
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:19,833
Okay. If there's money left after the kitchen, then vasectomy maybe.

37
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,369
So you do want the assignment.

38
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,458
Yeah, I want it! You really, really, really want it?

39
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,897
Yes. I really want it.

40
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, too bad. Because guess what.

41
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,091
Why does she get the mission?!

42
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,099
Because I said so.

43
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,371
Either way, we have a plane to catch.

44
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,092
We?! Why are you going?

45
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:37,896
I'm going to, um, a conference.

46
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,000
well, isn't that convenient?

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,236
If you think that's convenient, wait till you see my new kitchen.

48
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,632
Ha! Seriously, though, you should

49
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,352
Look through some of her design catalogs.

50
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:21,260
cyril: So, zoom, you're just jetting off to France.

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,729
Isn't that kind of sudden?

52
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,299
lana: No, baby. Sudden is wanting to move in

53
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,075
With somebody after only four months.

54
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,948
cyril: Talking! Just talking about it.

55
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,413
You know, I mean, geez, I moved

56
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:33,354
In with my last girlfriend after four weeks.

57
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,459
lana: What are you, a lesbian?

58
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,019
Why? Would you be into that?

59
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:38,972
Just curious. Which was an odd word choice

60
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,779
Right there, and am I talking out loud?

61
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:42,439
malory: Now remember.

62
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,022
I want the entire data system on those new servers, or I will

63
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,520
Just make it rain pink slips!

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,023
fear is a poor motivator.

65
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,405
Lana, I want you to call or text me at the top of

66
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,453
Every hour, and I'll call or text at --

67
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:56,329
Yeah, I'm gonna be kind of busy, hon.

68
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,819
Well, it's all on the schedule.

69
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,979
Oh, no, honey, the doors are closing, and I didn't get the --

70
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,392
Oh. So close.

71
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,704


73
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:07,954
No!

74
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,705
That's not why I'm -- but, look, you be careful with scorpio.

75
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,721
He won't hesitate to kill you.

76
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,585
Unless I get smothered to death first.

77
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,626
Oh, well, that's just pathetic.

78
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:19,908
But even though cyril may be clingy --

79
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,037
Oh, saran wrap could take a lesson.

80
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:26,111
You used to complain constantly that sterling was emotionally distant.

81
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:27,855
Yeah. I was just being nice, though.

82
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:28,936
I wonder if he's like

83
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,473
That because I used to spank him with a wooden spoon.

84
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:33,427
Uh, yeah, I don't know about that.

85
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,756
But it might explain the ping-pong paddle.

86
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,921
Merci! My point is, dear, you can trust cyril.

87
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,119
Now, you go have a fun assassination. Uh, okay.

88
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,979
Uh, and you go have fun at your thing.

89
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,417
Oh, I will. Bye, dear.

90
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:49,943
Did you rent a boat?

91
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,480
da! Is very pretty nice boat.

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,868
It better be, mr. Sex tape.

93
00:03:56,868 --> 00:04:00,739
And you, scuff that luggage, and i'll cut your hamstrings for you.

94
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,146
You know, I think we're making some progress.

95
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,786
where? In opposite world?

96
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,211
We're never gonna finish all this.

97
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,843
We can if certain people would help.

98
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:10,157
krieger: I'm sorry, are you addressing me?

99
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:14,220
Because your authority is not recognized in fort kick-ass.

100
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,100
Mr. Archer, you could help.

101
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,407
Hey, I'm helping cyril.

102
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,697
Text her again.

103
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:20,928
I am, if you'd shut up.

104
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,641
And really pour out your feelings.

105
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:23,990
Don't listen to him.

106
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,689
He's just trying to -- shut up!

107
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,462
Cyril, bare your soul.

108
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:32,292
so, did I say it's nice boat, or what?

109
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,114
Yes, nikolai, you certainly did.

110
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:37,626
Which hopefully explains my shock at finding myself aboard

111
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,202
The chum guzzler!

112
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,249
I am just getting that.

113
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,020
malory: Well, I know what you're not getting.

114
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,321
Give it to me! No!

115
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,769
cyril: Pam, I'm serious!

116
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,681
Give me my phone!

117
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,217
Cyril, goddamn it.

118
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,347
You're smothering lana.

119
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:53,207
cyril: Pam, I will hit you in the face!

120
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:55,839
archer: Don't listen to her, cyril.

121
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,103
You know, if there's one thing

122
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:00,069
Wotamen tolly love, it's to be smothered by men.

123
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,007
Like you'd know.

124
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,638
archer: Or choked, in your case.

125
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:03,632
Cyril, trust me.

126
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:04,840
Give her some space.

127
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,943
cyril: But why hasn't she called?

128
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,120
I mean, what if she's in danger or --

129
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,232
archer: Cyril, come on!

130
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:12,992
Worst-case scenario, her cover got blown, and scorpio's raping

131
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:16,823
Her senseless before he chops her battered corpse into fish food.

132
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:18,585
cyril: Oh, my god. What is wrong with you?!

133
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:19,895
archer: What?!

134
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:20,963
I said "Worst-case."

135
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:24,706
kroshk¨¢, leave that to your field agent.

136
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:27,227
Why must you always micromanage?

137
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:27,993
malory: I don't!

138
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:32,747
And if you will recall, I used to be an excellent field agent.

139
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:35,223
Is why I fall in love with you.

140
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,916
malory: My god, kolya, we were so young.

141
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,624
young. And in love. And in berlin.

142
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:45,304
On that magical, moonlit night, beneath the bridge of spies.

143
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:50,043
the night before you break my heart and disappear for nine months.

144
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:53,468
Kolya, there's -- there's something I've been meaning to tell you.

145
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,581
What is in this drink?!

146
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:57,706
oh, sorry.

147
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:59,459
Is ice from cooler.

148
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,800
Somehow it got butter all over it.

149
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,419
hey! Don't be queen of drama.

150
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,499
malory: That wasn't me, you idiot!

151
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:10,880
Oh, dear god.

152
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,130
archer: Cyril, stop. cyril: It's lana.

153
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,497
Here! Give me! archer: It's my phone.

154
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:17,481
Pam put yours in the blender.

155
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,321
It's called tough love, cyril.

156
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:21,199
krieger: The secret ingredient is phone.

157
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,366
archer: Myello? Mother?

158
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,028
What?! Really?

159
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,592
A-and you're sure it was lana?

160
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:27,526
cyril: What was lana?!

161
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,642
archer: Okay, I'm on it. cyril: Come on!

162
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,985
archer: What? Yes. God!

163
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:31,992
cyril: What did she say?

164
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,434
archer: Well, she's still really pro-vasectomy.

165
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:35,338
cyril: About lana!

166
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,456
archer: Oh, right. Yeah.

167
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:40,475
So, uh, remember that worst-case scenario we talked about?

168
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,310
cyril: Oh, my god.

169
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,305
krieger: Yes, I remember!

170
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,052
cyril: Archer, if anything --

171
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:44,964
archer: Cyril, relax.

172
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,185
I will rescue her.

173
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,338
So, krieger, how's about a roadie?

174
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:54,911
Because it would be nice to know what kind of danger i'm facing here.

175
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,559
What danger?

176
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:56,855
They do it outpatient.

177
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,918
Wha-- not the vasectomy.

178
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,742
The rescue.

179
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,141
How would I know?

180
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm at a conference.

181
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:04,238
Wait a minute.

182
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:05,358
You don't have a minute!

183
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,951
Now, will you just put a lid on it?!

184
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,675
All right. I'm going.

185
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:09,452
God!

186
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,890
shitty flying rats!

187
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,388
Just put the damn lid on it!

188
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,899
Commence operation

189
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,782
Something about I rescue lana

190
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:20,175
And she begs me to take her back, so then cyril commits suicide.

191
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,426
Swear to god I had something for this.

192
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,561
Seriously.

193
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,175
Are you people just bailing on this whole assignment or what?

194
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,114
Who gives a gosh damn about that?!

195
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:33,467
Lana's captured, maybe even -- rescued! Kenny crybaby!

196
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,503
Come on!

197
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:37,046
I bet mr. Archer already went all double-"O"-ninja on

198
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,639
Skorpio's ass!

199
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:40,269
Karate sound.

200
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:41,740
You really think so?

201
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,952
cyril, right this second, 

202
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,222
I Bet he's untying lana,

203
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:49,710
taking Off her ball gag, and she's Looking up into

204
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,943
his steely blue Eyes and parting her moist lips...

205
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,923
Wait a minute. Yeah, hang on, crazy pants.

206
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:56,987
krieger: Let her talk, woman! ...As he takes her in his

207
00:07:56,987 --> 00:08:00,890
Rippling rambo-y arms, throws her down...

208
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,603
Oh, my god!

209
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:03,593
...And then unh, unh!

210
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,993
yeah! Oh, yeah! That's right!

211
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,553
Give it to me! Unh!

212
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:08,651
Damn it.

213
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:09,394
Look what you --

214
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,520
Shouldn't you be off cooking a rabbit somewhere?

215
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,810
krieger: I've got some in the lab.

216
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,434
I mean, maybe it's not that.

217
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:17,208
But there's only one way to find out.

218
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:17,925
Give me that!

219
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,380
Ugh. Jesus, god.

220
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:22,489
I thought I gave you a fake number.

221
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,935
What? Archer, it's me. Cyril?

222
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,550
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

223
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,188
Well, that's too bad, mr. Man!

224
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,260
Now, you just put lana on the phone.

225
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,316
Well, cyril, I can't really do that either.

226
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,497
Uh, he says he can't put her on.

227
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:40,816
Archer, put her on the phone!

228
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,639
Cyril, buddy, look. When I see her, I will tell her to call you.

229
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,725
But I can't frickin' talk right now!

230
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:50,568
Archer? Hello? He hung up.

231
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,996
probably 'cause he's all... 

232
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,694
Oh, my god! I can't breathe.

233
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,563
And that's the reason I don't have sex with my co-workers.

234
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,600
That and no one ever lets me.

235
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,313
krieger: I've had good results with ether.

236
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:24,144
Oh, my god. Nikolai, something's wrong!

237
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:27,072
it's just fat dripping from kebabs.

238
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:27,722
Not that!

239
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,527
Kolya, my people need help!

240
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,995
Do you have any kgb agents nearby?

241
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,490
"Meh" What?!

242
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:40,083
I just don't feel so comfortable discussing kgb operations with you.

243
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,917
I tell you everything!

244
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,757
da. But is a little...

245
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,000
Unprofessional.

246
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:49,149
Swear to god, lana better be dead on a slab 

247
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,352
or Begging for mercy over a vat of acid or a shark tank or --

248
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:56,584
Drinking champagne in a bikini?!

249
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,127
Ah, screw me!

250
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,639
skorpio: two minutes, my love!

251
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:04,499
I'm just now again reshaving my balls again!

252
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,674
First of all, you have no right to interfere with my operation!

253
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,787
And not at it's any of your beeswax, but I did not have sex

254
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:11,417
With skorpio!

255
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:12,124
Oh, really?

256
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:13,002
No! God!

257
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,183
I just kept putting him off,

258
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:15,847
Making him reshave his balls.

259
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,976
So you can hang out on a boat?

260
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,209
It's a mega yacht!

261
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:20,326
And I just --

262
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,659
I needed a break from cyril.

263
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,299
Who thinks you got captur or killed.

264
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,572
What was that all about?

265
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,592
Uh, I actually forget what that was.

266
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,279
I've been hitting the sauce pretty hard.

267
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,997
Jesus, you are so irresponsible.

268
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:39,544
Oh, really?

269
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,297
Go ask pita who's irresponsible.

270
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,334
Hey, she knew the job was risky going in.

271
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,864
And since you didn't do your job --

272
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,262
lana: I will! All right?

273
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:47,829
Just give me, like, a week.

274
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:48,597
archer: Too late!

275
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,343
You had your chance, and you blew it.

276
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,478
Now, how's my disguise?

277
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,671
lana: Uh, it depends.

278
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:53,958
Who are you supposed to be,

279
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,391
Topper bottoms, stern yet sensual skipper of the

280
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,896
U.S.S. Rough service?

281
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,785
archer: What?

282
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,665
They're your clothes, idiot.

283
00:11:01,665 --> 00:11:03,001
lana: Ugh! Damn it.

284
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,911
That was the guy in charge of the chocolate fountain.

285
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:06,251
archer: There's a chocolate fountain?

286
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:07,532
lana: Oh, there's everything,

287
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,800
Great champagne, ridiculous food, a whole, like, 

288
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,999
squad of Hot little filipina masseuses.

289
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,181
archer: Skeet? lana: Probably.

290
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,005
And I just really need some "Me" Time 

291
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,914
before I have to go back to cyril and his whole --

292
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,045
archer: Curiously oppressive brand of love?

293
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,030
lana: I mean, come on. Haven't I earned that?

294
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,890
archer: Yes, we have. I'm staying.

295
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,219
 what No! Yes. No, you are not!

296
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:31,018
 Yes, I am, or would You prefer I tell cyril you slept with skorpio?

297
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,935
Even you wouldn't stoop that low.

298
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:34,208
Lana, come on.

299
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,951
This is me. Remember?

300
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,712
Unprofessional?!

301
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,439
From the man who used an entire

302
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:44,488
Kgb surveillance team just to make a sex tape of me?!

303
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:47,969
And entire kgb art department to

304
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:50,587
Airbrush wrinkles off your old ass.

305
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,355
I want to leave, please, right now.

306
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:57,257
so who's stopping you?

307
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,956
Smiles, everyone. Smiles.

308
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,238
For this party,

309
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:10,375
everything must be as perfect as my beautiful Companion.

310
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,557
skorpio: Because in one hour,

311
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:15,650
The world's most dangerous terrorists will gather here 

312
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,712
on The argo to bid on my humble wares.

313
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,633
Wait! Wait! You!

314
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:28,752
Chocolate-fountain guy, you look, uh... Different.

315
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:31,714
Um, I guess I've been working out.

316
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,731
skorpio: Yes, I can see that.

317
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,996
Quick, bring me some duct tape.

318
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:36,603
I, uh --

319
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,404
skorpio: Because this malaka is ripped!

320
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:42,603
Come, my dear.

321
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,491
Before the party, I must relax...

322
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,055
On top of you.

323
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,407
skorpio: No excuses, eh?

324
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,151
My balls are smooth.

325
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:52,830
And you know I love that.

326
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,832
skorpio: Not as much as I love chocolate.

327
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,743
skorpio: So you, malaka, bring plenty of it, yes.

328
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:02,647
I-I would prefer not to.

329
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,091
"Bartleby the scrivener"? Anybody?

330
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:08,636
Not a big melville crowd here, huh?

331
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,817
He's not an easy read.

332
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:13,440
And I drove her right into his arms.

333
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,191
his big, tan, muscle-bulgey arms.

334
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,831
Cyril, come on.

335
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,758
Don't listen to --

336
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,653
What the hell's your name now, anyway?

337
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:23,067
I don't even remember.

338
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,093
Exactly!

339
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:28,025
So, what you snorting off me?

340
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,433
krieger: It's mostly msg.

341
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,526
The flavor enhancer!

342
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,317
which you so need.

343
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,790
Pipe down, pipe cleaner!

344
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,463
And, cyril, it's a rescue mission, okay?

345
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,566
Probably fraught with danger.

346
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,135
You really think so?

347
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:44,150
I bet they're fighting for their lives.

348
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,970
Yeah. That --

349
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,435
That got a little dark.

350
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,558
skorpio: So, now we have champagne, huh?

351
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:58,991
Um, got anything a little stronger?

352
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,407
Or way stronger, like poison?

353
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,856
skorpio: Hmm. I think I have just the thing.

354
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:05,884
Oh, my god!

355
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:08,595
skorpio: Ready the shark tank For my guests,

356
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:12,588
 agents archer and kane, of isis!

357
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:13,774
You knew the whole time?!

358
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:15,030
skorpio: How you say...

359
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,157
all right, you heard mr. Skorpio.

360
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,708
skorpio: No, just "Skorpio."

361
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,404
Remember how we're doing that from now on?

362
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,735
sorry, sir. Uh, hang on just one second.

363
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:30,151
skorpio: Where was this enthusiasm before?

364
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,335
I know, right?

365
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,648
Now he wants to contribute.

366
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:34,558
Funny.

367
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,493
Actually, I'm getting this!

368
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,466
oh, no! grenade!

369
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,058
I had something for this, too.

370
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:41,626
Um...Damn it.

371
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,618
Eat grenade, stupids.

372
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,330
Oh, well, now what?!

373
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,706
ugh! Are you still here?

374
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,977
Where'd you get a grenade?

375
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,784
Hanging from the lampshade.

376
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:53,312
Wait. What?

377
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,150
Soulatka poutana!

378
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:59,316
What? Did he just call me a whore?!

379
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,186
Now, why on earth would he do that?

380
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:05,540
because he turns women into whores!

381
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,740
Just ask his slutty mexican cook!

382
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,364
Oh, my god! Yes!

383
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,740
We should call her!

384
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,221
Because I would literally murder

385
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,343
Somebody for some migas right now.

386
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:18,457
Every single noun and verb in that sentence totally arouses me.

387
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:20,203
And I am so open to that.

388
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,395
And, cyril, ignore her.

389
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:25,078
Nothing's going on between archer and lana.

390
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,719
Although...

391
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,844
cyril: "Although" What?

392
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,299
Well, every isis agent has a company-issued

393
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,131
Life-insurance policy.

394
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:34,255
And, uh...

395
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:35,273
cyril: And what?!

396
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,230
archer: You're my beneficiary!

397
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:39,901
lana: Your what?!

398
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,333
archer: On my company life insurance!

399
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,527
lana: Oh, my god!

400
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,269
archer: I mean, if this goes tits-up...

401
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:49,891
lana: Now? Really?

402
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:50,847
archer: Oh, right!

403
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,575
Because you walked into strippers discount warehouse

404
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:56,265
and Said, "Help me showcase my intellect."

405
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:59,206
lana: Discount?! Hello! This is fiacci!

406
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,892
Uh, I think it's pronounced "Knock-off."

407
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:06,241
Right after I get back, I am changing that stupid policy!

408
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:10,712
Ugh! Yes, you're my beneficiary.

409
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:13,441
How'd you get life insurance, lana?

410
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:15,976
Don't they know you're in the danger zone?

411
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,107
cyril: But that doesn't mean anything.

412
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:20,720
I mean, they could've forgotten to fill out new beneficiary

413
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,874
Forms, or --

414
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,891
They have to update those "Bennie" Forms every quarter.

415
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:29,933
cyril: But that means -- oh, my god!

416
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,356
krieger: Damn ass-hammered shit!

417
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,062
What?!

418
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:33,976
krieger: Benefits!

419
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:38,770
Oh, I forgot to spend the balance in my goddamn flex account!

420
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,306
Are you date of employment or --

421
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,358
krieger: Calendar year!

422
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,478
cyril: That's just leaving money on the table.

423
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:45,670
How did you forget that?

424
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,551
I guess I was busy fantasizing about archer and lana having intercourse.

425
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,356
Cyril, come on, hon.

426
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,114
We all were.

427
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,344
archer: And you expect me to believe that.

428
00:16:57,847 --> 00:16:58,925
lana: I don't care!

429
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,858
Just like I don't ever think about you!

430
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:02,937
Reloading!

431
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:03,991
archer: Firing.

432
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,361
So, when you filled out your insurance forms, 

433
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,837
you weren't Thinking about my tan,

434
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:10,913
 muscular Arss in the combat-firing stance?

435
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,570
lana: No! I wasn't!

436
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,530
I don't!

437
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,748
I mean, I'm --

438
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,741
archer: So full of shit, your eyes are brown.

439
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:23,059
No, they're -- oh, my god.

440
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:23,983
They're green.

441
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,043
Like emeralds.

442
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,379
How did I never see that?

443
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,204
Lana, your eyes are amazing.

444
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:30,119
lana: Archer --

445
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:31,523
archer: I mean, not compared to your tits, but --

446
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:34,558
What is your problem?!

447
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:35,325
lana: You!

448
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,430
And plus, I have a boyfriend!

449
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,178
archer: Oh, right.

450
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:39,928
How could I forget mr. Cling?

451
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:43,202
Cyril! Cyril, come on!

452
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,928
Let go!

453
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,687
God, he's stronger than he looks!

454
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,711
krieger: Get him out of here!

455
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,762
Because these corporate bagmunchers owe me

456
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:58,054
$630 for my goddamn flex account!

457
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,791
I cannot believe you shot me!

458
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:03,869
God, you know how much I hate that!

459
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,661
lana: Yeah, well, you better get used to it!

460
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:06,741
skorpio: Kill them, you fools!

461
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:07,422
Kill them!

462
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:08,723
lana: Oh, my god.

463
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,691
I am gonna die, and you are the last man I was in bed with.

464
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,474
archer: Well, one of them.

465
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,416
Don't worry. I won't tell cyril.

466
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:15,712
Probably.

467
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,383
lana: Shit! I'm out of ammo!

468
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,119
Archer! archer: Lana!

469
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,529
Lana, do you trust me?!

470
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,299
lana: What? No!

471
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,207
I don't trust you!

472
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:24,754
archer: Well, that's too bad.

473
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:26,156
Because guess what.

474
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:31,761
malory: Oh, my god!

475
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,166
Nikolai! Our son!

476
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,452
our what?!

477
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,094
malory: Oh, so, remember that

478
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,272
Little something I wanted to tell you?

479
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,117
a "Little something"?

480
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:46,045
Oh, that is just classic you!

481
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,615
malory: So I'm a little late.

482
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:48,846
a lot late!

483
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:52,233
No one could have survived that.

484
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,128
archer: Oh, man!

485
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,374
I am awesome!

486
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:01,729
lana: Ugh, and it just keeps on getting better.

487
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,496
archer: Lana?!

488
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,642
lana: Asshole?

489
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:04,612
archer: Oh, my god.

490
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,318
Was that not epic?

491
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:08,413
lana: First of all --

492
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,314
malory: Nikolai, look.

493
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,376
They're alive!

494
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,554
Oh, thank god!

495
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:13,447
thank god?!

496
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:14,772
For what?!

497
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:17,755
The lying woman I risked my career for?

498
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:21,003
The son she don't told me of?

499
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:24,971
Or maybe my damn security deposit?

500
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,930
malory: Psh! Security deposit.

501
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,699
What was it, a pair of flip-flops?

502
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:29,633
archer: Half the bounty.

503
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:31,103
Come on, I deserve it.

504
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,336
lana: Ha! Too bad!

505
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:33,832
So you can just paddle that hole

506
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:35,288
In your foot right on back to

507
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,990
Your cheesy mexican kitchen.

508
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,113
archer: Oh, I'll get a new kitchen.

509
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,393
But let's see you get a new

510
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,895
Boyfriend after I have a long talk with cyril.

511
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,991
About what, exactly?

512
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:47,226
How you cried during a two-man threesome?

513
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:50,419
Wooden spoons are a huge emotional trigger for me, lana.

514
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,748
lana: Yeah, and now I know.

515
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:55,033
And when I tell pam, so will everybody in the office!

516
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,764
archer: Oh, is that how you want to play it?

517
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:57,371
lana: Yep!

518
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,270
archer: Fine!

519
00:19:58,513 --> 00:19:59,782
You keep your stupid bounty, then!

520
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,366
And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.

521
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,012
lana: I will!

522
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,525
Oh, and cyril may be clingy, but at least I know I can trust him!

523
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:08,421
cyril: Oh, my god.

524
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,859
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

525
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:10,794
cyril, come on.

526
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,626
Snap out of it. Seriously.

527
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:14,429
It's not like we burned down the mainframe.

528
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:15,950
You really need to relax.

529
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,843
cyril: How?! My life is ruined! Again!

530
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,222
look, what happens on this

531
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:22,072
Scratchy green office rug stays

532
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,271
On this scratchy green office rug, okay?

533
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,567
cyril: You mean this, what we just did...

534
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,640
You'll keep this our secret?

535
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,609
yeah. God!

536
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,961
Cyril, you can trust me.

537
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:34,988
You know, probably.

538
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:36,697
cyril: Wha-- probably?!
