1
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,979
And that's your message?

2
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,705
My god, who...

3
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:12,494
Who's there?!

4
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:13,926
What do you want?!

5
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,122
Because all you're
gonna get is holes!

6
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:19,349
I-I mean holes in you, not my...

7
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,132
sterling?

8
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:23,245
Hello, mother.

9
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:25,177
Where the hell have you been?!

10
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,074
I don't know.

11
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:28,555
Wh-- and why do you
have a cleaver?!

12
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,463
"All interoffice
fraternization of an intimate

13
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,352
Nature is hereby prohibited,
to include, but not limited to,

14
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:42,375
Trysts, assignations -
-" What's this even mean?

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,588
It means no more
banging co-workers.

16
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,852
Oh, so it doesn't affect you...

17
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:48,746
Oh, wait. Guess what.

18
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,109
Hey, this isn't my fault!

19
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,006
It's exactly your fault, idiot.

20
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:54,683
When mother found out
you cheated on lana --

21
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,210
Hey, you cheated on lana plenty!

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,205
Yeah, but with starlets, models.

23
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:00,496
Oh, and one time,
two actual princesses.

24
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:01,400
Two at the same time?

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,328
Yeah, they were sisters. Sploosh.

26
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:04,563
Cyril, you threw lana

27
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,714
Away on chicks like -- like carol.

28
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:09,038
it's cheryl. archer: Exactly.
Back me up here.

29
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,492
You slept with her, too!

30
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,598
When I was bored.

31
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:12,698
Like, stuck at home, waiting for

32
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,683
The cable guy, or -- oh, hey,

33
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,013
What you doing Thursday
between 00 and noon?

34
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,515
1:00 and 4:00?

35
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,687
I'll be doing one
of your co-workers.

36
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,690
Well, do it before
quitting time Friday!

37
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,629
Why would ms.
Archer give us until Friday?

38
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,055
I did that, because
somebody in this building is

39
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:28,397
Gonna have sex with me.

40
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:28,944
Yeah?

41
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:30,302
You think between now and friday,

42
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:31,941
you can score some roofies?

43
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,785
Uh, pam, I will end you.

44
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,731
Where the hell is my staple gun?!

45
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,376
I think I saw cyril with it.

46
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,706
He went through my desk?!

47
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,410
I guess. I mean, he said he did.

48
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,901
Oh, I don't know why i'm surprised.

49
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,019
I mean, can you believe him,
cheating on lana?

50
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,766
Baffling. Said the kettle!

51
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,314
Which is why I started
that new policy.

52
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,805
Yeah? You idiots run around

53
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:58,553
Here like it's spring
break on south padre.

54
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,912
Just sex, sex, sex...

55
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,886
Sexy, sexy, eh?

56
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,628
Nikolai?! Is from
frederick's of latvia.

57
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:07,558
Mother! Oh, hello, son.

58
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,494
What?! Nikolai...
Why did he just call me son?!

59
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:10,776
Nikolai. What is this?!

60
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:13,932
You mean besides
incredibly awkward?

61
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,139
No, I think "Incredibly
awkward" Just about sums it up.

62
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,810
W-- mother!

63
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,712
Nikolai, could I call you back?

64
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:57,784
Da. I will be here maybe one hour.

65
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:59,957
Mother! jakov:
Then I try to hit gym.

66
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:01,846
The gym. That'll be the day.

67
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,381
Are you out of your mind?!

68
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,548
I must be, because it looks
like you just destroyed my

69
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:08,067
Steuben bar set!

70
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,009
Well, you just
destroyed my innocence!

71
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,496
Oh, please.

72
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:13,977
That brazilian au pair did
that when you were 13!

73
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,196
12! And why does nikolai jakov, the

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,418
Head of the kgb, have a
direct line to your office?!

75
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:23,128
Well, you know, from time to time -
no, just leave that.

76
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,821
You'll cut yours-- sterling!

77
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,280
And a follow-up question!

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,466
Why did he just call me son?!

79
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,728
That's...Often a figure of speech.

80
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:31,787
Yeah?! How often?!

81
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,106
Very often.

82
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:35,010
Just not in this case.

83
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,931
I know what --

84
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,144
What?

85
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,526
Terrific.

86
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:44,505
Two steuben glasses left,
and you break one.

87
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:47,681
I'm sorry, krieger, but it's over,
so here's all your

88
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,814
Creedence clearwater albums back.

89
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,019
And now a sad moon is on the rise.

90
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,276
I know. Devastating.

91
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,532
But it's not you,
it's your weak, womany hands.

92
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,165
They're not -
it's like being choked by a

93
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,715
Child, which I thought
would be hot, but --

94
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,123
Wait. No. I'll take steroids.

95
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:04,116
I can't wait. I need a man
now with monster hands.

96
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:06,992
Oh, like lan-- ah! Hey, you!

97
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,902
You know, the whole
monster-hands thing -- starting

98
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:10,886
To border on mean.

99
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:12,887
oh, you gonna run
cry to ms. Archer,

100
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,672
like when cyril Cheated on you?

101
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,360
Hello.

102
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,078
Well, at least my
ex-boyfriend isn't a noose I

103
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:20,718
Made out of extension cord.

104
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,621
guess what. She wasn't the
only one cyril cheated with.

105
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,488
And what is that supposed to mean?

106
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,145
figure it out, truckasaurus.

107
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:30,238
Oh, that gives me an idea.

108
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,936
But I already have a father!

109
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,108
His name was john
fitzgerald archer, and he

110
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,793
Was a fighter ace and he won the

111
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,302
Navy cross and his
men called him --

112
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:38,615
"Black jack" Archer.

113
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,990
I know, dear, I know.

114
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,451
Because I made it all up.

115
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,337
But the military funeral!

116
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:44,391
ready!

117
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,892
Oh, my god.

118
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,912
If we miss that train,
I will go blind.

119
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:51,156
fire!

120
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,775
But the 21-gun salute!

121
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,613
I donated 600 bucks

122
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:58,429
To a junior rotc
team up in yonkers.

123
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:01,616
What? Which they used to go
to a competition in albany,

124
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,255
Where they won third place!

125
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:05,286
What? malory: So a lot
of good came out of that.

126
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,009
Oh, so, all's well that ends well?!

127
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:07,922
What was I to do?

128
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:10,495
Tell a 3-year-old his
father might be in the kgb?!

129
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,167
What?! What do you mean, might be?!

130
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:17,721
So, there may or may not be a
few other possibles in the mix.

131
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:19,976
What?

132
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:20,729
Seriously?

133
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,360
You cheated on me with carol?!

134
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,948
cheryl! Exactly.

135
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,312
And I can explain that.

136
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,455
Well, if you'd let me!

137
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,513
Yeah, tell me how my father
might be nikolai jakov,

138
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:34,306
Head of the kgb,
or len trexler, head of odin!

139
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:36,655
I assume those are my only choices!

140
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,386
Oh, my -- who else?!

141
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:41,804
Gene krupa.

142
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,850
What?! The drummer?! No,
wait, not krupa.

143
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,368
The other one, with the teeth.

144
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:47,772
Buddy rich.

145
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:49,997
Oh, my -- i could never
say no to a drummer.

146
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:51,575
Could you say no to anybody?!

147
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,383
I said no to plenty.

148
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:57,265
No. No. Yes. Have sex with me.

149
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,584
No. Please? No.

150
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:00,370
Oh, come on!

151
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,983
Nobody would ever know!

152
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,496
Yeah. I'd know.

153
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,454
No! Da!

154
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:07,768
No! jakov: Let me talk to him!

155
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:08,683
No! jakov: Kroshka.

156
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:10,244
Nikolai, he's not even here.

157
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,244
He stormed out, thanks to you!

158
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:14,418
But I could talk sense into him!

159
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,257
After all, I am his father.

160
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:18,809
Oh. So...

161
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:22,470
Len trexler or buddy rich?!

162
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:25,730
Get me that crazy german! Now!

163
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,400
Hostile work environment.
jakov: Shut up!

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,757
We're going to kidnap
agent sterling archer.

165
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,737
oh, yeah, then what?
You hurt his feelings?

166
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,456
Nyet! Then we put new mind-control

167
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:37,358
Microchip into his brain.

168
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:41,807
We use its remote-control
capability to bring him here,

169
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,721
Make the papa test.

170
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,941
And if I am archer's father, I

171
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:49,754
Turn him against his own
mother as soviet agent.

172
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:52,284
Make him a, how you say, vole.

173
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,564
I think you mean "Mole."

174
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:56,334
mole.

175
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:00,572
Vole is also rodent but more
closer related to lemming.

176
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:06,661
Ah, da, da, da.

177
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,945
Come on, buddy.

178
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,070
Can't you read, ass douche?!

179
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,984
You're not supposed to
be here without a kid!

180
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,785
as it happens,
I am here with a child.

181
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,344
mani, can we have more
money for the sweets?

182
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,920
What?! That's not even a real baby!

183
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,084
Und that is?

184
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,104
I thought you were

185
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:31,747
Off to the fair mit
your prize turnip!

186
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,458
Listen, you kraut puke!

187
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,157
Hallo? Oh, ja.

188
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,707
You should go.

189
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,702
Oh, you're lucky his
father's not here.

190
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:40,966
He knows krav maga!

191
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:44,383
He'll kick your balls right
through your head, nazi shit-ass!

192
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:45,940
Mani, these peoples!

193
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,788
Well, you wanted him
to grow up in the city.

194
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:51,088
Oh, scheisse! Nein, major, not you!

195
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,414
Ja, listening.

196
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,576
And after you take archer to the...

197
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,988
...Kgb safe house on gansevoort,

198
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,830
You will implant the
microchip into his brain.

199
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,778
Got it.

200
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,740
Ja, seriously.

201
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,228
Okay, uta, we have a job, so --

202
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,033
W-where is the diaper bag?

203
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,367
I forgot where I put it.

204
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,930
huge surprise.

205
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:15,418
Idiot!

206
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:16,780
What is wrong with you?!

207
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,135
And just who the happy
hell do you think you

208
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,608
Are, hanging up on me?!

209
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:23,942
Oh! You gonna tell your boyfriend,
len trexler, or

210
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:25,226
Maybe gene krupa?!

211
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:26,646
It was the other one!

212
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:29,460
Maybe. Or you, maybe, or -- whoever

213
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,069
It was, he wasn't there to raise

214
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,507
Sterling, so I don't
need him butting in now!

215
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,517
We'll see. What?

216
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:37,289
Nothing. Nikolai,
what are you scheming at?!

217
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,697
Nothing. Again he hangs up on me!

218
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,712
And there goes the last steuben.

219
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,241
sploosh!

220
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,124
Yes. that's what I'm talkin' about!

221
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:53,960
Yep, yep, yep.

222
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:56,710
wait...You think it's safe?

223
00:08:58,644 --> 00:08:59,447
No.

224
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,493
Okay, we got the french

225
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:04,936
Chick and carol and
anybody else, rambone?

226
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,080
No. Hi, cyril.

227
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,508
Scatterbrain jane?! Really?!

228
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,422
Well, see, she had just been
diagnosed with breast cancer.

229
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:17,338
oh, right!

230
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:19,693
I forgot, your dick's
full of radiation and...

231
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,626
Mastectomy coupons.

232
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,913
Boy, you are just so determined
not to be cool about this.

233
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,701
Yep. Anybody else?

234
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:30,914
Ms. Archer, you're
trying to seduce me.

235
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:33,784
Aren't you?

236
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:34,648
Nope! lan okay.

237
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,580
No. No one. lana: Okay, get out.

238
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,487
Of...My own office?

239
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:39,936
Yep. cyril: Why?

240
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:43,944
Oh, you don't want to be here...
When I bang every last

241
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:44,716
Dude in the building.

242
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,525
Whaty. lana:
Right here on your blotter.

243
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,597
No! lana: Yep.

244
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,367
You can't do that! lana: Really?

245
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,936
Is it opposite day already?

246
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,230
Uh, attention?

247
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,868
Hi, this is agent kane, and if

248
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,388
You want to have ball-slappy sex

249
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,424
With me on cyril's desk, please

250
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,361
Line up and take a number.

251
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,085
You heard the lady!

252
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,943
Take a number!

253
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:08,864
86'ed?!

254
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:11,709
Unh-unh! You don't 86 me!

255
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,140
'cause my dad won the navy cross!

256
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,321
Use the door!

257
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,348
Help! Please help me!

258
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,300
My baby! He's swallowed something!

259
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,452
He's choking!

260
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,628
Uh, who gives a shit about a baby?

261
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,604
Who would want to
raise a child here?

262
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,754
Well, that was a
huge waste of time.

263
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,530
I said, don't take
your clothes off.

264
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,687
Well... Begged, even.

265
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,798
Well! This is good to go.

266
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,086
So was this.

267
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:44,347
So, let's get number 2 in here.

268
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,037
You really think
this is gonna work?

269
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,608
Pam, look at me.

270
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,914
Yeah...Sploosh.

271
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,090
Now serving number 2!

272
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,090
I'm 2!

273
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,545
That's me! Move, dude!

274
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:57,580
Animals!

275
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,458
You're all just animals!

276
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,426
Lying in wait at

277
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,579
The watering hole,
taut buttocks all aquiver...

278
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,184
What the... gillette:...
Aching to pounce

279
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:07,337
On the supple,
brown flesh of your woman.

280
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,888
Shut up! gillette:
They're gonna mess her up.

281
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,997
Why are you even here?
gillette: Hello...

282
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:13,261
But you're gay! gillette:
Girl, please.

283
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,794
Nobody's that gay.

284
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,620
Wait. What? What, what?

285
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,328
What part of "You pay
me $600" do you not get?

286
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,742
The...Part where we don't have sex?

287
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,584
You get to say we did,

288
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,918
Which is like half the
reason men have sex!

289
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,699
But that's a lot of money.

290
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,137
Not compared to
rotator-cuff surgery.

291
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:31,108
What? Which you're gonna need

292
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,796
After the jillion high-fives you

293
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,388
Give your little bros.

294
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,220
Okay, I'm in! But the first guy you

295
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,624
Tell is cyril,
and you make up the sickest --

296
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,039
Yeah, shut up. Do you take plastic?

297
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,102
5% discount for cash.
I thought it was 10%.

298
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,254
I can't wet my beak?!

299
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,839
Hey, seriously,

300
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,622
Kidnappers, super not in the
mood for this right now.

301
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,739
Or that. What is that?

302
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,450
Is that a drill?

303
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,338
Okay. I don't want that.

304
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:02,059
Okay, so, I make a

305
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,409
Klein hole in the skull mit this.

306
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,428
You can shut that off.

307
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:08,172
Then, into the hole, i smoosh this.

308
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,622
What is that? manfred:
Und then they can

309
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:10,875
Control his brain.

310
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,894
But is soviet technology,
so it's a "Kreppenschutze."

311
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,255
This is amazing, no?

312
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,106
What is amazing is

313
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,204
We just ran into him on the street.

314
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,824
Hey. manfred: It's a huge city.

315
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,546
Hey, proposition!

316
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:24,335
First person to untie me, guy or

317
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:27,632
Gal, I will let him or
her give me a handy.

318
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,097
Come on, let's share the
lkma of hu n kindness!

319
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,750
What an arsch hole! Come on.

320
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,917
Don't worry, your time is coming.

321
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,012
Wait? My time? Do you mean me?

322
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,164
And by "Don't worry,"

323
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,563
Do you mean the chick's
gonna be doing the handy?

324
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:43,826
And either way, can we
do it without that thing?

325
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,492
Hey, seriously.

326
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,994
Give me a hanjo.

327
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,535
It doesn't work.

328
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:04,141
I drill hole in head of
man who maybe is my son,

329
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:11,372
put chip in his brain,
and now you tell me it doesn't work.

330
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,617
you should have asked
me before, you...

331
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,701
See, in testing we have had

332
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,330
Teensy problem with signal from

333
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,411
Satellite.

334
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,788
When it is in small window, just

335
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,855
Over the target, it can signal

336
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:23,660
The chip.

337
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,040
but when it exits this

338
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,930
Window...

339
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:31,710
This problem does not

340
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,104
Sound teensy!

341
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,452
it is, compared to the

342
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,784
Problem we had with interference

343
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,074
From cellphones.

344
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,652
...Which, in lab, sent our

345
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:45,078
Subjects into ferocious,

346
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:46,716
Homicidal rages.

347
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,505
So, obviously, we need to tweak it.

348
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,822
Damn that crazy, jealous russian.

349
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:53,998
Bet he's hatching some

350
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,646
Half-assed,
vodka-soaked scheme to --

351
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,013
Hello? Sterling?

352
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:01,379
Sterling, listen very -
ha! Voicemail.

353
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,673
You know what to do. What?

354
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,106
we're sorry... Damn it!

355
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,401
Carol? Carol!

356
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,485
And just where the hell is she?!

357
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,260
krieger! Aah!

358
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,027
Oh! Oh, god, sorry!

359
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,626
Sorry. what are you doing?!

360
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:19,680
I thought you said,
"Start slacking off."

361
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,708
not "Slacking off"!

362
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,674
Dude, swear to god,

363
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:27,340
She gave me a jane hathaway,
right on my chest!

364
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:29,662
My man knows what
I'm talkin' about!

365
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,105
Doesn't anyone work around here?!

366
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,084
And, cyril, I am so disgusted

367
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:36,593
With you right now,
I just want to vomit.

368
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,756
That's exactly what I said to lana.

369
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,590
37?

370
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,593
37?

371
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,305
Ooh! C'est moi.

372
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,075
move.

373
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,341
Just get it done by Friday.

374
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:15,652
Oh, come on, sterling,
pick up, pick --

375
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:17,501
Sterling? archer: Hello?

376
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,826
Sterling, what's wrong?

377
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,301
Are you -- alternate voicemail.

378
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,640
You know what to do, stupid.

379
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,872
we're sorry, the number...
malory: I'm done.

380
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:27,246
He's dead to me.

381
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,058
"Mother."

382
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:31,588
Ubil...Mat.

383
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,315
Kill...Mother.

384
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,668
Oh, my god, I'm exhausted.

385
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,870
Whereas I am merely confused.

386
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,877
If you told every
guy the same thing,

387
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,369
then they all know that none
of them had sex with you,

388
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,809
so they're all gonna
realize they're all lying.

389
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,251
Hey, yeah.

390
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,404
Wait a minute.

391
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:56,035
But, remember, they're s.S.

392
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:59,385
what? brett: Um,
I had sex with lana.

393
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,366
me too.

394
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:03,247
Lana kane, you magnificent bastard.

395
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:06,065
I just hope cyril doesn't,
like, snap.

396
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,122
cyril? Snap?

397
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:10,325
Snap. P girl,lease...

398
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,609
7...6...2...

399
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:17,913
Millimeter...Full metal jacket.

400
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,331
Someone's in here!

401
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,704
Holy shit snacks!

402
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,304
You made over 20 grand!

403
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,010
Minus my 60 bucks.

404
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,486
Plus cyril's broken heart.

405
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,650
Not too shabs, pam.
Are you kidding?!

406
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,203
36 guys?!

407
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,267
It's like "Schindler's
list" Up in here!

408
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,974
pam! And I'm like that little

409
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:36,880
Gandhi dude, helping out
with the books, and the --

410
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,478
Inappropriate analogies!

411
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:40,853
What the hell is wrong with you?!

412
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:42,711
nothing!

413
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm a desirable, full-bodied

414
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,785
Woman, but nobody
will have sex with me!

415
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:53,443
And I have so much love to give!

416
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:57,299
Get on the desk. Really?!

417
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,724
Yeah, come on, before I

418
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:02,478
Change my mind,
but you cannot say a word.

419
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,022
I won't tell anybody!

420
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,833
No, honey, I mean during,
cause I'm gonna pretend

421
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,162
You're alex karras.

422
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,326
And that's your message?

423
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,040
My god, who...

424
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,215
Who's there?!

425
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,404
What do you want?!

426
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,717
Because all you're
gonna get is holes!

427
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:25,628
I-I mean holes in you, not my...

428
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,637
Sterling?

429
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,780
Hello, mother.

430
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,714
Where the hell have you been?!

431
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:32,652
I don't know.

432
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,160
Wh-- and why do you
have a cleaver?!

433
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:38,940
I don't know.

434
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:41,916
Well, you're safe now...
So get out.

435
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,951
I'm hungry. So lick that coat!

436
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,949
You smell like a -- grilled cheese.

437
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,121
What? Grill me a cheese.

438
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:50,280
I'm not grilling you a cheese!

439
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,519
Oh, for god's sake.

440
00:17:57,404 --> 00:18:00,878
Waltz in here, dressed like
some sort of cattle rapist,

441
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,936
waving a cleaver and reeking
of what I hope to god is meat,

442
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,544
and that's all you have to say?

443
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,612
I don't know. I was worried sick.

444
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:11,189
Called you twice, came this
close to leaving -- and why

445
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:12,927
Doesn't your voicemail just say

446
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,715
"Leave a message, I'm a jackass"?

447
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:16,878
I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know.

448
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,310
What is wrong with you?

449
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,720
My head hurts!
And I have no father!

450
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,067
Sterling, of course you
have a father, just maybe

451
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,335
Not the one you wanted.

452
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:26,694
And you! Irnd me neither!

453
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:28,373
Because even though
that whole weekend

454
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:30,278
is just a big jazzy blur,

455
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,372
I'm pretty sure it wasn't buddy.

456
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,223
all these years, you lied to me!

457
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:37,090
I -- sterling,
I was protecting you!

458
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,017
From what, this sandwich?!

459
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,184
This is swiss, mother!

460
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,536
Because that's all i had, you ass!

461
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,268
Just like I'm all that you have!

462
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,293
Well, I hate it! And I hate you!

463
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,623
Sterling malory archer,
you will eat every last

464
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,829
Crumb of that sandwich.

465
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,392
No! malory: Then get out.

466
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,674
I'll call you a cab.

467
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:00,000
What? Sterling,
stop that this instant!

468
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,130
Ubil mat!

469
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,405
Kill mother.

470
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,087
Kill mother!

471
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:07,976
Police, police.

472
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,120
Have to call the -- aah!

473
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,978
I'm having a nightmare,
and you lock me out of your bedroom?!

474
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,657
Sterling, no! Stay back!

475
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,105
Only this time,
you'll be crying for help, and

476
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:22,108
I'll be the one drinking
and laughing in there with

477
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,194
Uncle buddy!

478
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,644
Sterling, I'm warning you!

479
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:27,908
Sterling!

480
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,456
Sterling?

481
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,380
sterling?

482
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,616
Sterling!

483
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,333
What?! God!

484
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:41,604
Well, whose fault is that?

485
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:44,040
Waving a cleaver,
screaming in russian?

486
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,511
I'm sorry. malory: Ass.

487
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:48,023
Seriously, I don't know
what's going on with my head.

488
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:48,958
Filthy coat.

489
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,353
Can't tell what's cow's
blood and what's yours.

490
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:53,530
The wet blood, mother, is mine!

491
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,242
And it's ruining my
brand-new linens!

492
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:58,047
Sorry! malory: This is why
I can't have nice things.

493
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,572
Why, because you shoot them?

494
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,691
Serves you right.

495
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:01,964
You nearly scared me to death!

496
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:03,904
Well, you obviously
weren't that scared,

497
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,355
judging by your grouping.

498
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,360
Hah! Guess the old
gal's still got it.

499
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,635
All 6, right in the
10 ring. Hooray.

500
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:14,534
Just like I taught you,
without any help from...

501
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,973
Whoever your father is.

502
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:18,028
Yeah, you were always there for me,

503
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:19,784
which I never really thank you for.

504
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,154
Sterling, I don't need thanks.

505
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,838
That's what makes me
such a wonderful mother.

506
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,032
Are you kidding? Don't be shitty!

507
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:28,868
Can't we just enjoy the moment?

508
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,726
Yeah, how could we not?

509
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:34,849
Ass.

510
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:44,850
