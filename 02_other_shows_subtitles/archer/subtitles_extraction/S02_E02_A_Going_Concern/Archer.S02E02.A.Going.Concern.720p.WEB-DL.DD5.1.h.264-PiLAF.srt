1
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:02,321
MALORY: Splendid. Yes.

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:05,530
And we'll work out all
the details when... hm?

3
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:09,439
Yes, it sounds amazing, it really
does, but...

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,193
We'll talk about it when
you get here.

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,609
Hm? Mm.

6
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,807
Something on your mind, dear?

7
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:17,964
ARCHER: Not anymore.

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,571
MALORY: What in the... a microchip?

9
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,263
Russian markings?
What on earth is this?

10
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:26,517
ARCHER: Krieger thinks it's some kind of
satellite-linked mind-control device.

11
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:28,751
MALORY: Mind control?
Why does he think that?

12
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:31,314
ARCHER: Because he removed it from my brain?
MALORY: What?!

13
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,277
ARCHER: I told Krieger about my headaches,
he gives me a cat-scan, then boom.

14
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:38,189
Next thing I know he shoots me full of
some kinda, I dunno, fish paralyzer...

15
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:41,222
MALORY: That crazy...
ARCHER: And then it was drill, baby, drill.

16
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,873
MALORY: Oh my God,
how do you feel?

17
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,595
ARCHER: Little pissed off, actually.

18
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:47,670
MALORY: Well that's understan...
ARCHER: Because it was obviously

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,126
put in my brain in the first place by
your boyfriend, Nikolai Jakov of the KGB!

20
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:54,743
MALORY: Sterling, first of all we're not
even together anymore...

21
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,899
ARCHER: I bet.
MALORY: And second of all!

22
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:59,841
Why would he put a mind-control
chip into your brain?

23
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,780
ARCHER: I assume because
he thinks he's my father!

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,353
MALORY: And what, you think he wanted to...
mind-control you into loving him?

25
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,278
ARCHER: You tell me!
That's your specialty!

26
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:09,606
MALORY: Get out.
ARCHER: No.

27
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:10,589
MALORY: Yes!

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,360
ARCHER: Mother, you've been
lying to me my entire life!

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,828
Just for once, I want you
to tell me the truth!

30
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:18,173
MALORY: Well, people in
hell want ice water.

31
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:22,099
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm right
in the middle of a fairly huge deal.

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,965
ARCHER: Buying a lock factory?

33
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,678
MALORY: For your information,
I'm... no,

34
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:33,319
never mind,
you'll find out soon enough as it is.

35
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,419
ARCHER: Oh, that's classic you!

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,610
Avoid the truth, bury the secrets,
hide the...

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,541
- MALORY: Oh for the...I'm selling ISIS!
- ARCHER: You what?!

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,585
MALORY: There! Happy?

39
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,935
ARCHER: No.

40
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:55,976
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

41
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,151
ARCHER: Mother, tell
me this is a joke!

42
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,362
MALORY: The only joke
is my bank statement.

43
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:25,538
ARCHER: What?

44
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,097
MALORY: Everything I had was in a hedge
fund, but it turns out the whole thing

45
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,606
was nothing but a damn Ponzi scheme...

46
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,417
I lost all my money.
I'm ruined.

47
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,703
ARCHER: so you're selling ISIS?

48
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,079
CYRIL: She what?!

49
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:43,358
PAM: Aww, maaan...
That's totally not iree.

50
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,027
CHERYL/CAROL: Then why don't
you go back to Jamaica?

51
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:49,511
PAM: A, because I got deported, and B...
So can she actually sell ISIS?

52
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,925
Like, doesn't the government own it?

53
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,499
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, I've
never been clear on that.

54
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:55,731
CYRIL: It's way too complicated to
explain, especially to you two,

55
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,687
but short answer yes,
she can sell ISIS.

56
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,009
The question is, who would buy it?

57
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:01,979
ARCHER: ODIN?!

58
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,450
CHERYL/CAROL Or whom...

59
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,276
MALORY: Yes, ODIN.

60
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:10,207
ARCHER: Why would ODIN want to buy...
Oh my God, is Len Trexler behind this?!

61
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,580
MALORY: He made me a
very attractive offer.

62
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:13,349
ARCHER: I bet!

63
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:16,960
That's because he wants to...
you know, that! With you!

64
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:19,601
But... wait a minute, does he know you're...
TREXLER: Gorgeous!

65
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:21,006
MALORY: Hello, Leonard!

66
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,645
TREXLER: Hello, beautiful!

67
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:23,616
Hey, kiddo.

68
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,429
ARCHER: Hey back and if you don't mind,
we're kind of in the middle of something?!

69
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,248
MALORY: Actually Sterling,
if you don't mind?

70
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,467
Len and I have a lot to talk about.

71
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,943
ARCHER: Like selling
ISIS out from under us?!

72
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,320
TREXLER: That, and the round-the-world
luxury cruise I'm taking with your mom.

73
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,463
ARCHER: The what?
TREXLER: Hopefully in the honeymoon suite!

74
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:40,436
ARCHER: The what?!

75
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:44,110
CYRIL: And then the unemployment
office, after ODIN lays us all off.

76
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:44,980
CHERYL/CAROL: Ugh!

77
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,216
That totally stinks!

78
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,104
PAM: Eh, you were on
borrowed time anyway.

79
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:49,395
CHERYL/CAROL: No, that!

80
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:50,529
What are you eating?!

81
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,200
PAM: Ackee and saltfish.

82
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,076
GILLETTE: Yeah thanks,
this is only mohair!

83
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,979
So, you really think ODIN's
gonna get rid of everybody?

84
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,595
BARRY: No. Not everybody...
In fact, ODIN plans to promote

85
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:06,076
a very select few ISIS personnel to
fill some of the impending vacancies.

86
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,738
LANA: Vacancies like...?

87
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,419
BARRY: Malory Archer's chair.

88
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:10,490
LANA: Wh-? Really?!

89
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,616
BARRY: Well figuratively, I mean I don't
know about the actual chair, but...

90
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:21,173
LANA: So I'd be like, like the...
BARRY: Regional director for the Americas.

91
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,498
LANA: Barry, that's my dream job!

92
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,064
BARRY: Yours for the taking.

93
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,970
If you are similarly mine.

94
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,375
For the taking.

95
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:30,284
LANA: Taking as in...
to get this job I'd have to have sex with you?

96
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,433
BARRY: Your words.

97
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,959
And also mine. Yes.

98
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,112
ARCHER: Hey! hey!

99
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:42,355
Do you idiots wanna
hear my plan or not?!

100
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:45,699
Okay, so... suggestions.

101
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:46,569
CYRIL: About... what?

102
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:47,723
ARCHER: What're we talking about?!

103
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,289
Stopping my mother from
selling ISIS to ODIN!

104
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,977
CHERYL/CAROL: You said you had a plan!

105
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:54,973
ARCHER: My plan, is to
crowdsource a plan!

106
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,969
My ear bells!

107
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,320
MALORY: Don't you people
have work to do?!

108
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,557
TREXLER: Not for long, huh?

109
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:09,271
Uh, can't wait to welcome each and
every one of you into the ODIN family!

110
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,553
And speaking of, kiddo, hope you're
gonna welcome me into your family.

111
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,631
ARCHER: My fam..., uh, uh, uhrrowrrmf!

112
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,801
MALORY: Ugh!

113
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,375
You people better not track
that onto the carpet!

114
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,079
It's filthy enough as it is.

115
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,012
C'mon, Len.

116
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,256
TREXLER: I'll follow you
anywhere, my sweet!

117
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,828
PAM: Holy shitsnacks...
CYRIL: Is Trexler buying ISIS

118
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:32,473
just to get your mother to marry him?!

119
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:36,465
ARCHER: No! Yes! Look, shut up.
PAM: That is some high-priced MILF.

120
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,222
ARCHER: Hey! Shut up!

121
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,763
And think of a way to make
Trexler not want my mother!

122
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,468
PAM: We could give her a MILFectomy.

123
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:45,613
ARCHER: If you say milf one more time,
I will shoot you in your eyeballs.

124
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:50,113
CYRIL: She does have a point,
though Not the... m-i-l-f part!

125
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,337
But if we could make Trexler fall out of love...
CHERYL/CAROL: How?: Trust me,

126
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,893
you can't control a person's heart.

127
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,850
KRIEGER: You can with a
little thing I like to call a

128
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,508
deep-cycle marine battery.

129
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,993
Or LSD.

130
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,491
CHERYL/CAROL: Is that what
you've been giving me?!

131
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:06,039
KRIEGER: Yes?

132
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:08,060
CYRIL: Well that explains a lot...
CHERYL/CAROL: I thought those

133
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,152
were breath strips!

134
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,355
KRIEGER: But anyway, whatever,
emotions like "love" don't

135
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,937
actually come from the heart, they
come from the... ARCHER: The brain!

136
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:14,915
KRIEGER: Yeah.

137
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:18,095
Or LSD.

138
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,733
ARCHER: Oh, come on...

139
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,511
Where is the trust?

140
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,725
ARCHER: What could be so secret she
wired it up with twelve pounds of C-4?

141
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,486
Ugh, I don't think I even wanna know...

142
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,414
GILLETTE: What.

143
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,235
ARCHER: Nice.

144
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,709
Here, take a look at this.

145
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,283
Okay, which one of these wires
GILLETTE: Blue and yellow.

146
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,022
ARCHER: Ya wanna look at it
for more than half a second?

147
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,797
GILLETTE: I wired the damn thing!
Ass!

148
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,377
ARCHER: Well I didn't know that!
Ass!

149
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:02,551
ARCHER: Okay...
GILLETTE: I lied, I didn't wire it.

150
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,354
ARCHER What?!

151
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,122
GILLETTE: Badumpbump.

152
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,363
ARCHER: You think that's funny?

153
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,169
GILLETTE: Not compared to that.

154
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,524
What is that?
Oh yeah.

155
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:13,481
ARCHER: No no no no no,
Ray what do I do?!

156
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,435
GILLETTE: Well if you don't shut if off...
ARCHER: She'll know somebody was in here!

157
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,967
GILLETTE: So you could wait
for the batteries to die...

158
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,395
ARCHER: Okay, yeah that's...
GILLETTE: But sounds like

159
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,013
there's about four big ol'
D-cells in it.

160
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,076
ARCHER Aww, maaan...
ARCHER: Yeah, it's... it's pretty big.

161
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:26,899
GILLETTE: Is it black?

162
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,615
ARCHER Wh-? No, it's...
GILLETTE: Slightly darker black?

163
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,804
ARCHER No!
It's not any kind of black!

164
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:32,308
GILLETTE: Racist.
ARCHER: Shut up!

165
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,949
It's more of a...
Aubergine?

166
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:35,853
I guess you'd call that?

167
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:36,956
GILLETTE: Oh. Still pretty hot.

168
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:37,959
ARCHER: Will you shut up?

169
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,040
GILLETTE: Take a picture.
ARCHER: Shut up!

170
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,073
Okay, I'm going in.
Aww man, can't believe I'm doing this...

171
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:45,016
GILLETTE: Try to think
about something else.

172
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,554
Like how there's no sink in there.

173
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,861
ARCHER: So what if
there's no... Oh my God!

174
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:49,663
GILLETTE: Yeah.

175
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,043
ARCHER: There's no sink!

176
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:57,200
ARCHER: Ugh... there's not enough liquor
and therapy in the world to undo that.

177
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,639
I touched my mother's dildo.

178
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,596
GILLETTE: You shoulda borrowed these.

179
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:03,906
They're like super heavy du... aagh!

180
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:04,507
LANA: Hey!

181
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,344
What the hell're you doing?

182
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:06,279
ARCHER: What're you doing?!

183
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:07,316
Making robot birds?

184
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:10,793
Lana we're in crisis mode, Mother's
trying to sell us to ODIN!

185
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:11,661
LANA: I know.

186
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,434
So how about don't break any
more stuff in my new office?

187
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,676
ARCHER: Your new... oh my God,
ODIN's making you the new boss?

188
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,856
LANA: Yup. I mean, I kinda maybe have to
sleep with Barry, but... ARCHER Wh-?!

189
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:21,825
Lana, how can you do that?!

190
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:24,485
LANA: By getting drunk and knowing it's
the same thing your mother's doing?

191
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,032
And I know that it's killing you
that she's leaving you for another man,

192
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:30,132
and you better not mess it up for me.

193
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,593
ARCHER: Speaking of mess, you traitor,
your stupid birdbot is leaking.

194
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,996
LANA: My what?

195
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:34,566
Aw, shit!

196
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,538
ARCHER: Probably hydraulic fluid.

197
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,812
LANA: It's sweet-and-sour, dumbass!

198
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,420
ARCHER: Yeah who's the
dumbass now, Lana?

199
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,494
BARRY: Or whom...
ARCHER: Barry.

200
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,664
How's your shattered femur?

201
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,780
BARRY: How's your... creepily childlike
feeling of maternal abandonment?

202
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,719
ARCHER: The sale isn't
final yet, Barry.

203
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:52,755
BARRY: No, but it will be.

204
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,932
And we're here to make sure of it.

205
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,973
So don't try to do anything stupid.

206
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:01,882
ARCHER: I don't have to try.

207
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,024
Shit, whatever, move.

208
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,996
BARRY: Barry, is that
how you get ants?

209
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:09,905
Yes it is, Other Barry, yes it is.

210
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:21,059
KRIEGER: Okay, the satellite link is online...
So let's play God.

211
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:26,692
ARCHER: Freaky... KRIEGER: I'll tell
what's freaky, is guess what I had already

212
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,594
named this bunny.

213
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:28,453
ARCHER: Rabbert Klein.

214
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,008
KRIEGER: Wow, that's...
actually better.

215
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:32,677
ARCHER: All yours.

216
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,490
So can you put it in a person's brain?

217
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,295
KRIEGER: He'd suffocate.

218
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:39,799
ARCHER: Not the rabbit, idiot!

219
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:40,401
The chip!

220
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,839
KRIEGER: Oh! Yes, absolutely!

221
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,390
ARCHER: Without killing the person?

222
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:46,864
KRIEGER: Oh. Yeah, maybe.

223
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,265
TREXLER: Ahhhh...
doesn't that feel good?

224
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,071
MALORY: Feels better than this offer.

225
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,845
Len, I need at least
twenty percent down.

226
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:57,454
TREXLER: Aww c'mon, it's not
like you need the money.

227
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:58,256
You're already loaded.

228
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,430
MALORY: What if...
I weren't?

229
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,871
TREXLER: Then you'd know
I loved you for you.

230
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,275
MALORY: You really do, don't you?

231
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:06,081
TREXLER: And always have.

232
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,358
MALORY: What about all those years you
spent shacked up with what's-her-face,

233
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:10,226
the crazy one?

234
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,902
TREXLER: Anastasia...
MALORY: No, the tall brunette.

235
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:13,771
Crazy-crazy.

236
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,074
TREXLER: Yeah, Anastasia.

237
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,010
She killed herself.

238
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,827
MALORY: Oh. Right, sorry.

239
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:22,697
BARRY: Yeah, that's
how you like it, huh?

240
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:28,897
All down in your nooks and crannies...
LANA: So hey, hate to interrupt

241
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:31,857
your conversation...
BARRY: It wasn't a conversation Lana,

242
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:35,636
I was just talking to
my gun, not with it.

243
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,772
Pretty big difference.

244
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,815
LANA: Huge, yeah, so, are they in there
signing the sale contract, or...?

245
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,319
BARRY: As we speak.
LANA: Yessss!

246
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:44,829
Cause I've got tons of ideas to run this
place more efficiently once I'm ODIN's

247
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:45,966
regional director.

248
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,538
Already jotted a bunch down.

249
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,079
BARRY: Hey, that's great.

250
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:55,428
Hope you bring that same kind of enthusiasm
and self-starterishness to having

251
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:56,564
sex with me.

252
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,099
LANA: Oh.

253
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:00,109
So us hooking up is still, um...
BARRY: A perquisite for the job, yeah.

254
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:01,838
Or is... do I mean prerequisite?

255
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,006
Either way, Barry's pretty stoked.

256
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:08,969
ARCHER: Okay, so that's Barry and Lana...
Pam, you're the amorphous

257
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,941
rasta-blob...
PAM: Big ups.

258
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,551
ARCHER: Those are the ODIN guys,
Ray you're the little pink sailor,

259
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,625
and... Why do you have so
many damn dolls in here?

260
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,865
PAM: For sexual
harrassment complaints.

261
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,074
So people can non-verbally indicate
where stuff happened on their body.

262
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,813
ARCHER: Yeah that
takes like, one doll.

263
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,685
PAM: Not if there's ever a gang rape.

264
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,544
ARCHER: Cyril, better pill up.

265
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,098
You're assisting Krieger
with the surgery.

266
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,204
CYRIL: Wh-? ! Why me?!
ARCHER: You're good at math.

267
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,777
CYRIL: How is that supposed to help?!

268
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:34,345
ARCHER: Can't hurt.

269
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:38,189
Ray you lure Lana into the
mainframe, Carol you lure Barry...

270
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,159
GILLETTE: I wanna lure Barry!

271
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,831
ARCHER: Wrong bait Ray, he's straight.

272
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:41,834
GILLETTE: How do you know?

273
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,471
ARCHER: How do I... he was engaged!

274
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,894
GILLETTE: I was married!

275
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,380
For two years.

276
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:52,275
I mean, she was a lesbian, but still...
we met in a "Pray Away the Gay" bible group.

277
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,298
That was a pretty weird time for me.

278
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:55,773
ARCHER: Just get Lana
in the mainframe!

279
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,845
I'll take care of Trexler, and Pam?

280
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,852
You're job is to neutralize
the ODIN agents.

281
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,036
PAM: How the shit am I
s'posed to do that?!

282
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,842
ARCHER: With Krieger's
magic breath strips.

283
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,054
KRIEGER: But do not touch them.

284
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,607
Lysergic acid is absorbed
right through the skin.

285
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,292
Even the tip of your fing... uh-oh.

286
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,965
ARCHER: Oh for [BEEP]'s sake, Krieger!

287
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,823
You're about to do brain surgery!

288
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,209
KRIEGER: Yeah, so...
sooner's gonna be better than later.

289
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,822
ARCHER: Dammit, how
much time do we have?!

290
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,624
CHERYL/CAROL: For me, usually
about twenty minutes.

291
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,384
ARCHER: Usually?!
CHERYL/CAROL: Less if I take two.

292
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,830
CYRIL: Man, you have got a problem.

293
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,361
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh right,
like you're one to talk.

294
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,893
PAM: Yeah, Pillbo Baggins.

295
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:27,210
CYRIL These are from a doctor!
CHERYL/CAROL: So?!

296
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,412
Krieger's a doctor!

297
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,684
CYRIL: Not a medical doctor!

298
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,991
KRIEGER: Not even the other kind.
Technically.

299
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,284
ARCHER: I gotta tell ya guys...

300
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:38,041
Um, not feeling super-confident
bout this plan.

301
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,489
PAM: Racist.

302
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,958
CHERYL/CAROL: I guess you
must be the infamous "Barry"

303
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:50,497
everyone's talking about.

304
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,570
BARRY: Yeah, go away?

305
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,841
CHERYL/CAROL: (giggling)

306
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:57,385
- Infamously few of words I guess!
- Go away.

307
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,755
Um, so Lana said to give you this?

308
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,671
BARRY: Pretty succinct.

309
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,521
CHERYL/CAROL: Guess you
guys have lots in common!

310
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,365
Like, I bet your genitals are the
same distance from the ground.

311
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,631
BARRY: Look alive, gang.

312
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,704
I think Archer's gonna try
to torpedo this deal,

313
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:19,532
so until the contract is signed, don't
let Archer anywhere near that office.

314
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,174
What're you... don't do that,
You asshole.

315
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:25,593
We're buying this place.

316
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:29,547
Carpet's shitty enough as it is...
PAM: I'll tell ya what's shitty,

317
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,415
is somebody's breath around here.

318
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:34,414
Whoa! Here, take three or four of 'em.

319
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,255
Probably won't kill you guys, either.

320
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,431
Cause somebody smells like they ate
the ass end out of a northbound cow.

321
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:40,792
LANA: Well?

322
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:41,954
What do you think?

323
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,323
GILLETTE: I think I'm
gonna miss you so much!

324
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:46,421
LANA: Aww honey, you're
not going anywhere.

325
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,634
Not when I'm the regional director.

326
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,516
GILLETTE: But are you
sure you'll get the job?

327
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:55,126
LANA: Totally, yes!
I mean, I do kinda have to sleep with Barry,

328
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:56,731
GILLETTE: Oh right, he
said tell you he's in the

329
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,911
mainframe and it's now or never.

330
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,793
LANA: Really?
GILLETTE: Used those exact words.

331
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,416
LANA: Uck.
It all feels so... dirty.

332
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:04,089
GILLETTE: Yeah, the
carpet in there's gross.

333
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,003
LANA: No, trading sex for this job.

334
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:09,585
I mean it's the chance of a lifetime, but...
GILLETTE: Honey, look at me.

335
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,811
We all gotta do what we all gotta do.

336
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,950
LANA: You wouldn't hate me for it?

337
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,957
GILLETTE: Oh, God no.

338
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:19,167
But just do reverse cowgirl, because
that carpet's seriously heinous.

339
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:20,018
ARCHER: Wow!

340
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:21,975
So guess that worked, huh?

341
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,944
PAM: Pamela cool runnins, mon.

342
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:27,019
ARCHER God, would you
give it a rest, um uh...

343
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,983
Damn, I had something for this.

344
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:32,918
PAM: Blob Marley.

345
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,636
MALORY: Alright, there's my signature.

346
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,770
And once you countersign...
TREXLER: We can set sail for romance!

347
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,495
Mazatlan, Maui, maybe even a small
wedding on the beach in Tahiti?

348
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:49,155
ARCHER: Yeah, about that...
Can I borrow Len for a second?

349
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,176
MALORY: Why?

350
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:54,387
ARCHER: To... give him my blessing
in asking for your hand in marriage?

351
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,315
MALORY: Well that's just weird.

352
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,798
TREXLER: No, it's beautiful!

353
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,925
Well maybe not traditional,
but it's a damn classy move!

354
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,421
After you, kiddo!

355
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:08,981
LANA: Barry?
BARRY: In here!

356
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:12,298
Just doing some deep knee bends.

357
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,376
Nude.
Wanted to stay loose.

358
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,714
LANA: Yeah, so listen, about the job, and this...
I don't think I can do it.

359
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,936
BARRY: Then why'd you
send me that note?

360
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,922
LANA: What note? What the... ?!

361
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,587
Hey! Hey! Open this damn door!

362
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,972
GILLETTE: Sorry, honey!
Please don't hate me!

363
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,971
Just doing what I gotta do...

364
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,162
TREXLER: I sorta pictured more

365
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:34,426
of a lounge, Morris chairs,
that kinda stuff...

366
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:38,305
ARCHER Yeah. So listen, about you and Mother...
TREXLER: We're in love, kiddo.

367
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:39,463
ARCHER: Well, maybe you're in love.

368
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,215
She's just in need.

369
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:42,392
TREXLER: Of what?
ARCHER: Of money!

370
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:45,353
She's broke, Trexler, she lost
everything in a Ponzi scheme.

371
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,215
TREXLER: So what're you saying, she's...
ARCHER: Using you!

372
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:49,675
You dumb idiot!

373
00:15:52,128 --> 00:15:54,553
TREXLER: Doesn't matter.
I'm crazy about her!

374
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:57,992
And if I can be there for her when she
really needs me, then all the better!

375
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,392
ARCHER: I was afraid you'd say that.

376
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,412
TREXLER: Why? Ow! Why...

377
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,845
...are you doing that?!

378
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,420
CYRIL: Hello...
TREXLER: What is that?!

379
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,597
CYRIL: Fish paralyzer?

380
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:07,962
TREXLER: Okay.

381
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:11,351
ARCHER: Okay, he's out.
How's Krieger doing?

382
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,016
CYRIL: Not, um, great.

383
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,623
KRIEGER: Yes he is, let's do this!

384
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,944
BARRY: So, are we gonna do this or...?
LANA: No, we're not.

385
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,423
For a big list of reasons, at
the top of which is Archer.

386
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:23,815
BARRY: You're not still into that guy?

387
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:27,825
LANA: No! But he's out there, somewhere
and somehow, dashing all my hopes.

388
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,413
BARRY: Look this sale
is gonna happen.

389
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,473
So what we should do is
spread our clothes around,

390
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,837
so our naked bodies don't
touch this carpet.

391
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:39,580
MALORY: Oh, for the... sweet-and-sour?

392
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,913
Might as well start an ant farm.

393
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,310
And what's taking those two so long?

394
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,826
ARCHER: Wow.
So that didn't take long, huh?

395
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,666
TREXLER: I dunno...
ARCHER: That was rhetorical.

396
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:49,630
Okay, Krieger!

397
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,264
KRIEGER: Yes!
ARCHER: What are you doing?

398
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,728
ARCHER: What's next?!
KRIEGER: Uh uh uh...Okay, cue visual!

399
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,532
CYRIL: Roger! Cueing visual!

400
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,791
TREXLER: Awww!
There's my lovely lady love!

401
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:06,782
KRIEGER: Okay now, uh... wow, that feels good...
ARCHER: Krieger!

402
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,669
KRIEGER: Oh!
Commence the Modified Ludovico!

403
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,882
CYRIL: Commencing the
Modified Ludovico!

404
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:17,610
TREXLER: Aaghh!
No no no, I don't like this!

405
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,056
Who is that... horrible woman?!

406
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,336
ARCHER: That's Malory Archer.
You love her.

407
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:26,385
TREXLER: Oh no. Oh no no no no.
Ick!

408
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,968
ARCHER: Krieger?!
KRIEGER: Uh, uh...commence satellite link!

409
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,945
Commencing satellite link!

410
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,497
ARCHER: So, you wouldn't
want to marry her?

411
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:40,369
TREXLER: No, eww! No, please!
Make it stop!

412
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,780
CYRIL: Uh, uh, what do I do, what do I...
KRIEGER: Just hit tab!

413
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,460
CYRIL: Oh.

414
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,141
KREIGER: Idiot.
ARCHER: Okay, it's over.

415
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,268
And you're sure you don't
want to marry that woman.

416
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:51,106
TREXLER: Oh God, no!

417
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,240
No, ya know what I want?

418
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,660
ARCHER: Tell me.
TREXLER: Some of that lettuce.

419
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,852
ARCHER: Um... okay.
TREXLER: Or actually all of it?

420
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:59,787
And the bunny attached to it, he's attached
right, can I have the bunny and the lettuce?

421
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,694
ARCHER: Uh, can we
give Lenny the rabbit?

422
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,272
TREXLER: And the lettuce!

423
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,539
ARCHER: Sure thing. Go to town.

424
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,698
TREXLER: Yeah...
cause they're brothers.

425
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,792
ARCHER: Is he always going to be
like this, cause now I feel bad.

426
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,642
MALORY: Sterling? Len?

427
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,988
Either and or both?

428
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,179
Where the hell are you? ! Len!!

429
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,815
BARRY: Yeah, do you know where he is?

430
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,974
MALORY: Yes, I'm just screaming his name
down the hall to celebrate that fact.

431
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:28,659
BARRY: That some kinda joke?
MALORY: Is that?

432
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:30,940
BARRY: It's cold in here.

433
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,308
TREXLER: Because she's here!

434
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:35,907
The big bad lady is
here and she is cooold!

435
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,268
MALORY: Len, what's going on?!

436
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:40,389
TREXLER: You're mean and I don't
like you and I don't want ISIS

437
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:43,665
or you and all I want is this
lettuce and his brother...

438
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:46,587
ARCHER: Rabbert Klein...
TREXLER: Rabbert Klein, so Barry, you ass,

439
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:50,597
for the love of all that's green take
me and Rabbert to the lettuce store!

440
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:58,989
MALORY: Sterling Malory Archer...
ARCHER: Yes, Mother... I'm here for you.

441
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,028
GILLETTE: You did the
right thing, honey.

442
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,744
LANA And all it cost
me was my dream job.

443
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,374
And a broken hand.

444
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,478
Which kills...
Pam: Here.

445
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,940
LANA: I'm good.
PAM: Racist.

446
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,384
ARCHER: Buy you a cup of coffee?

447
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,198
Ya know, since you're broke?

448
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,588
MALORY: You meddling ass.

449
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:22,661
Sterling, I know what you did to Trexler.
ARCHER: I didn't do anyth...

450
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:23,512
MALORY: Yes you did!

451
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:26,102
Because certain "items" in my desk...

452
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:27,885
ARCHER: Bop bop bop bop bop!
I can't hear you.

453
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,452
- were not where I put them!
- Bop bop bop bop bop!

454
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:33,258
MALORY: And we never need to speak of
that sickening invasion of privacy again.

455
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,895
ARCHER: Yeah, and the...
neverer the better.

456
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:39,663
MALORY: But since I can only assume that
Russian mind-control chip is rattling

457
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:43,118
around in Len Trexler's bald head...
ARCHER: Not rattling,

458
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,994
Krieger stapled it...
MALORY: I had to go Plan B,

459
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,632
and lease out three floors
in the building...

460
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,679
And also sell the cleaners.

461
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,310
ARCHER: You sold the cleaners?
To who?

462
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,915
POPEYE: Or whom...
ARCHER: Wh-? ! Popeye?!

463
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:55,780
POPEYE: Mmm-hm.

464
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,201
MALORY: And he paid upfront, in cash!

465
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:02,001
ARCHER: Yeah not surprising, considering
the fact he's a loan-sharking pimp!

466
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,099
POPEYE: Former loan-sharking pimp.

467
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,417
I'm going legitimate.

468
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,793
ARCHER: What do you know
about dry cleaning?!

469
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,707
POPEYE: I know you still
owe me three grand.

470
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:11,047
ARCHER: Yeah and I told you...
POPEYE: And I also know I got

471
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,150
five of your hand-tailored
suits in the back.

472
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,312
ARCHER: Wh-?
You're holding my suits hostage?!

473
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,586
POPEYE: Collateral.

474
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,384
Now get the [BEEP]
outta my cleaners.

475
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,340
MALORY: I think it's a good fit.

476
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,141
See you tomorrow Popeye!

477
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:23,513
POPEYE: Mm-hm.

478
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:29,380
What do I know about dry cleaning...
I know I'm switching from perc to D5.

479
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,365
Goin green up in here.

480
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,066
