1
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:04,758
MALORY (O.S.): Hurry,
hurry, sit down, come in!

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,089
I have the most fantastic news!

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,751
ARCHER: What, did
Bub finally die?

4
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:10,025
LANA: Who's Bub?

5
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,493
MALORY: My mother, and before
you make some snotty comment,

6
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:15,658
yes I have a mother, do you
want to hear my news or not?!

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,258
LANA: Yeah, if you're done
yelling at me for no reason.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,194
MALORY: Last night, an Air Force B-52
bomber crashed off the coast of Bermuda!

9
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:26,250
RAY: What? That's bad news!
ARCHER: Well it's about frickin time!

10
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:29,634
What, we're we not bombing them in
advance of an amphibious invasion?

11
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:30,934
LANA: Why would we invade.

12
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:32,067
Bermuda.

13
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:35,468
ARCHER: Ah, Bermuda. I
was thinking Bahamas.

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,302
LANA: Same question.

15
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:39,171
ARCHER: Same answer, Why not? It's
how we got the Virgin Islands.

16
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,741
CYRIL: Actually, the United States
bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark.

17
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,043
ARCHER: Okay, Mr. Peabody...
MALORY: Are you finished?

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,177
ARCHER: Yes.

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,848
MALORY: Good. Because the B-52 was -

20
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:50,547
ARCHER: In the middle of
the Bermuda Triangle, is this

21
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:53,282
about the Bermuda Triangle, because
that's my fourth biggest fear!

22
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:56,017
MALORY: It's about
the B-52's payload!

23
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,685
MALORY: Namely, a Mark-28

24
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:59,052
hydrogen bomb.

25
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:00,520
EVERYBODY: Ohhhh!

26
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:03,088
MALORY: Which ISIS...
is going to recover.

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,188
EVERYBODY: What!?

28
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,624
MALORY: And then give to the U.S.
government in exchange for a huge reward!

29
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:11,026
CYRIL: So, ransom it back.

30
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:16,463
MALORY: No, not ransom it, Cyril, we're-
look, semantics, whatever, this is -

31
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:17,063
CYRIL: Treason?

32
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,665
MALORY: A huge
opportunity for ISIS!

33
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:25,705
Or the Russians... MALORY: The B-52 is
on the ocean floor here, at a depth

34
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,174
of eight thousand feet...

35
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:28,509
ARCHER: or thirteen hundred

36
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,643
thirty-three fathoms.

37
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:30,844
LANA: How do you know that?

38
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:31,612
ARCHER: How do you not?

39
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,714
MALORY: So recovering the bomb
requires a deep submergence

40
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:39,486
vehicle. The only American DSV is here,
in the Pacific. The Russians have

41
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:42,989
one in the North Atlantic, so if
they hear about the wreck and start

42
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:46,860
- steaming toward it-
- They don't actually steam anymore, Mother.

43
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:50,029
MALORY: It's a figure of speech,
like "shut your hatch,"

44
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:54,635
because my point was, the Russians will
beat them to it. So we are going to

45
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:57,037
beat the Russians.

46
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,273
ARCHER: Give it up, folks!

47
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,007
Mike Eruzione!

48
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,244
LANA; Well - shut up - since
Krieger doesn't have a

49
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:10,282
submersible hidden in his lab...
KRIEGER: Or do I?

50
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:12,317
I don't, actually.

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,519
ARCHER: Then how are we supposed to
beat anybody to a hydrogen bomb, under

52
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:17,987
two-point-two-seven
leagues of water?!

53
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,222
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my Jesus
God damn alright already!

54
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,623
MALORY: Can I
possibly help you?

55
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,191
CHERYL/CAROL: Please, I know
you were talking loud so

56
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,793
I'd hear you, so whatever, but
we're not speaking so if you

57
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:32,764
want a deep submergence whatever you can
talk to my stupid gross brother Cecil!

58
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,032
Who, by the way, is
here to see you.

59
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:36,934
Ms. Archer will see you now.

60
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,168
CECIL: Thank you, Cheryl, I-
CHERYL/CAROL: Rrraaaghh!

61
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,837
I hate you!

62
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,773
CECIL: Hello, I'm Cecil Tunt.

63
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:46,175
I believe you're in need
of some assistance?

64
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:46,875
ARCHER: (chuckling)

65
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:50,712
Yeah, RienPoortvliet just called,
he wants you to pose for him.

66
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:54,081
C'mon, beloved
illustrator of "Gnomes"?

67
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,883
Jesus, read a
coffee table book!

68
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:03,889

70
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:35,187
ARCHER (O.S.): Wow, you own an
island, an undersea laboratory,

71
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:38,074
and this... choppersaurus?

72
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,410
Guess it doesn't suck to
be a billionaire, huh?

73
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,512
CECIL: Probably not, but
Cheryl and I split our

74
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,150
parents' estate, so technically I'm
only worth five hundred million.

75
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,619
Which also doesn't
suck, obviously.

76
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:51,155
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Unlike you
who totally sucks obviously!

77
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,890
PAM: Will you shut up?!

78
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:57,461
I swear to God, if you get us kicked
off before I get my jumbo scrimps on -

79
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:59,997
You'll wish you were
Michael Findlay.

80
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,632
CHERYL/CAROL: A, Cecil won't
kick you off, he wants

81
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:04,101
everybody here, for no good reason--
MALORY: He doesn't need one,

82
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:07,705
he's an American hero. Who's
going to make me rich.

83
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,606
CHERYL/CAROL: And B, that's
not even real shrimp.

84
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,008
This is all vegan-soy-bullshit.

85
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,042
PAM: Pffrrfft! Prrfft! Puh!

86
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,077
CHERYL/CAROL: Because he's
totally vegan, because his

87
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,614
stupid gross girlfriend Tiffy's a
vegan, and a... brother-stealer!

88
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:20,084
TIFFY (O.S.): Who can also
totally heeearyoooou...

89
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,119
CHERYL/CAROL: Which is amazing
because why aren't you dead

90
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,187
from protein deficiency?!

91
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,890
TIFFY: Uh, because I get all
eight essential amino acids

92
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:30,194
from amaranth and quinoa without
murdering helpless animals?

93
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:30,928
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Oooooh!

94
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,829
TIFFY: kkkuughh!

95
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:33,298
CECIL (O.S.): Hey, Tiff?

96
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,968
Could you, instead of antagonizing
her, maybe go ahead and take off?

97
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,506
Love yoooou.

98
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:44,043
We'll rendezvous with my research vessel
in a few hours, so in the meantime,

99
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:47,880
I guess, continue to make such
wildly liberal use of the bar.

100
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:52,384
ARCHER: Done! You're okay, Cecil. I
don't get why Cheryl hates you so much.

101
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:52,918
CECIL: Right?

102
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,021
ARCHER: I mean, you've got
this whole Jacques Cousteau-

103
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:58,291
- thing going on, that's-
- Just one of many philanthropies. I have so

104
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,826
much on my plate, as it were.

105
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:03,898
Children Without Plates, speaking of
plates, uh, Doctors Within Borders...

106
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,999
ARCHER: Within borders.

107
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,834
CECIL: Well, of countries
ravaged by war.

108
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:09,937
ARCHER: Right, otherwise-
CECIL: Otherwise there's not really much point.

109
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,842
Then there's Nourish A Child, Shoe
A Child, Bespectacle A Child,

110
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:18,612
umm, One Laptop Per Child Soldier...
ARCHER: Wait, what?

111
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:22,283
CECIL: Which, unfortunately, soon became
One Thousand Laptops Per Warlord.

112
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:24,785
ARCHER: Man, all those charities
have gotta cost, like -

113
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:26,921
CECIL: Hey! I should
go help Tiffy.

114
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:32,293
Since we're flying into the Bermuda Triangle...
where mysteries abound!

115
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,995
ARCHER: What kind of mysteries?

116
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:37,265
CECIL: I'm kidding!

117
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,467
ARCHER: Well Cheryl,
you come by it honest.

118
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,369
LANA (O.S.): Speaking of...
ARCHER: Aagh! Lana c'mon,

119
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:43,171
we're about to fly into the
Bermuda Triangle, my nerves

120
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,673
are frayed enough as it is.

121
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:45,540
LANA: Really.

122
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,976
ARCHER: No, Long Island Iced
Tea number three really took

123
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:48,977
the edge off. Want one?

124
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,848
LANA: No, I'm not drinking, but-
ARCHER: Oh my God! I totally saw this coming!

125
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,816
LANA: You saw what coming?

126
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,885
ARCHER: Did you not join
the Nation of Islam?

127
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:57,919
LANA: No, Archer, I -

128
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,687
ARCHER: You know they won't

129
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,655
let you keep dating Cyril,

130
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:00,989
right? Plus no bacon?

131
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,624
LANA: You done?

132
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,694
ARCHER: Well for now, but after I take a nap-
LANA: You'll wake up just in

133
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,597
time to get shot for treason, because
your mother wants to ransom a hydrogen

134
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,332
bomb back to the United
States government.

135
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:14,837
ARCHER: It's a reward! And maritime
salvage law is very clear on the subject.

136
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,605
According to Cecil.

137
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:17,974
LANA: And what's he
getting out of this?

138
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:21,477
ARCHER: I... guess whatever useless
thing philanthropists normally get from

139
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,380
squandering their
money on the poor.

140
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:27,317
LANA: So what, he's conducting a huge
naval operation just for a warm fuzzy?

141
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,319
ARCHER: I -- hey, wait a second!

142
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,220
LANA: What?

143
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:33,023
ARCHER: I think I have
room for a fuzzy navel.

144
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,059
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Wow Tiffy,
who taught you how to fly?

145
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,828
Was it that goose you freed,
ruining last year's Christmas

146
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,432
dinner, or --
TIFFY: Rrrgh, Cecil, I swear to Goddess...?

147
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:46,103
CECIL: I know, Tiffy, but please, try
to focus on the greater good. In the

148
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,939
words of the immortal Jeremy Bentham-
TIFFY: Good thing I'm

149
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,009
immortal, cause if she says one
more word to me I will slam

150
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,045
this helicopter into
the frickin ocean.

151
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,882
CECIL: Well, you seem busy.

152
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:04,120
MALORY: So say it's worth two billion,
a fair reward on that would be...

153
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,488
CECIL: um, hello!

154
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,491
MALORY: Oh, Mr. Tunt! Please,
join me, you're just the person

155
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:11,528
I want to talk to...
CECIL: And I you. About my

156
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,498
sister. I was curious if
you'd noticed anything...

157
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,667
well, curious, about
her behavior.

158
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,602
MALORY: Ha! Ha! Ha!

159
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,969
Oh, you're serious.

160
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,638
CECIL: I'm afraid so, yes.

161
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,807
MALORY: Well how much
time do you have?

162
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:31,081
CECIL: As much as you need...
CECIL (O.S.): Oh my God, I

163
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,451
don't know what to say... I have
figuratively lost my tongue.

164
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:37,854
MALORY: With Brent it
was almost literally.

165
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,622
That's why we can't
have scissors.

166
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:42,925
CECIL: I had no idea her mental state
had declined to such an extent. I mean,

167
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:47,063
the arson's not surprising...
CHILD CECIL: What have you done?

168
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:47,897
CHILD CHERYL/CAROL: Ha haha!

169
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,732
Take that, gazebo!

170
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,002
CECIL: But you're
telling me she had...

171
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,905
MALORY: Mm! Choke-sex,
that's her kink!

172
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,877
With a KGB cyborg. After she led him
straight to the ISIS safehouse,

173
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
at 921 East
Seventy-Third Street.

174
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,449
CECIL: Oh my -- wait,
is that classified?

175
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,853
MALORY: I won't tell if you won't tell...
CECIL: Mmmkay! Well, I

176
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:11,957
appreciate your candor in this matter, Ms. Archer-
MALORY: Oh no, it's Ms.

177
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,081
Oh.

178
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,086
CECIL: Ms., yes, thank
you for, um... yes.

179
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,594
ARCHER (O.S.): Come on, you
call this fully stocked?

180
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,330
And no Georgia peaches?
What the--?

181
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:33,231
ARCHER: What're you doing?

182
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,132
CHERYL/CAROL: I --
what're you doing?!

183
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:38,102
ARCHER: Hairy navel. Started
as a fuzzy, but I'm calling

184
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:42,873
this vacation, so... Okay.

185
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,109
Love our little talks!

186
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,677
PAM: Rrowrf. Nom nom nomnomnom.

187
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,379
CECIL: Hi, it's Pam, right?

188
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:51,215
Enjoying the cruelty-free
vegan seafood buffet?

189
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,885
PAM: Mrmff, it's pretty good, once you
get over how allergic I am to soy.

190
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:56,454
CECIL: What?! Oh my
God, don't eat that!

191
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,890
PAM: Wh-? Hey! I am
a consenting adult.

192
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:03,695
Plus I assume you've got an epi-pen
on this big Riptide-lookin' bastard?

193
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:07,131
CECIL: I -- yes, in the first
aid kit in the cockpit, but -

194
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,900
PAM: Well then shut up.

195
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:15,173
CECIL: Shutting up, yes. But before I do, could I...
ask you a few questions?

196
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,841
LANA: How is everybody
okay with this?

197
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:18,675
GILLETTE: How are you not?

198
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:19,376
CYRIL: Lana, you heard Ms.

199
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:21,378
Archer, it's either us
or the Russians, and -

200
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,214
LANA: I did not hear that, actually, but-
GILLETTE: But if you found

201
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:26,984
somebody's wallet, you'd
expect to get a reward, so -

202
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,552
LANA: What if they
won't pay a reward?

203
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,120
Then what, she just
keeps the bomb?

204
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,488
CYRIL: C'mon, it's not
gonna come to that.

205
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,624
GILLETTE: Ooh, but if it does
we could move to Cecil's island

206
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,058
and be a rogue state!

207
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,661
CYRIL: Coool...
LANA: Ugh, forget it.

208
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:42,165
Oh, and also dummies? We're five
hundred miles from the nearest tree.

209
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,835
CYRIL: Hey thanks, Magellan!

210
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:47,538
Hey wait, why the heck are you
painting my face like this?!

211
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,073
GILLETTE: Cause you look fierce.

212
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,074
Rrowr.

213
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,209
PAM: Rrowrf.

214
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,077
CECIL: Well thank you, Pam,
I appreciate your candor,

215
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,215
and -- you really, really should
really stop eating those.

216
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,583
PAM: Last one.

217
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:02,119
Mmrowmf.

218
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:05,155
LANA: Malory, please, is there any way
I can get you to reconsider this?

219
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:08,925
MALORY: Well, if you feel that strongly...
LANA: I so do.

220
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:12,662
MALORY: Cecil says marine salvage goes
for ten to twenty percent of the item's

221
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:16,600
value, but since all I'm asking is a
measly three percent, if you've got

222
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:19,302
sixty million dollars
lying around...?

223
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:20,303
LANA: Bwexqueeze me?!

224
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:21,604
MALORY: I know, right?

225
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,506
It's a steal at twice the price.

226
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:27,111
GILLETTE: Yeah and about that, Cyril
figured out how big our bonuses should be.

227
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:28,212
MALORY: Your what?!

228
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,380
CYRIL: I -- Ray made me!

229
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:31,783
GILLETTE: Cyril! C'mon
you're fierce, rrowr!

230
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:34,319
ARCHER (O.S.): Rrraarrgh!

231
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,654
No! Don't!

232
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:37,555
[grrrrzzz]

233
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,090
CECIL: Uh, could I speak
to you for a moment?

234
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,525
ARCHER: "Wildly liberal use,"

235
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,261
Cecil, those were
your exact words!

236
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:46,698
CECIL: No, of course, that's totally fine,
but I wanted to talk to you about -

237
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,167
ARCHER: Don't say high-
functioning alcoholism.

238
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,202
CECIL: I wasn't. Going to.

239
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:52,269
ARCHER: Well then
what's on your mind?

240
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,873
CECIL: Well, it's about my sister...
ARCHER: Hey whoa! I dunno what

241
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,343
she told you but Carol's a consenting adult, so-
CECIL: Well that's actually

242
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:01,711
kind of my point, I wanted
to ask if you'd ever

243
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:09,052
seen my sister acting strangely, or-
ARCHER: Ha! Oh, you're serious.

244
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:13,190
[creepy music]

245
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:18,128
CHERYL/CAROL: Just ignore
it, it's non-diegetic.

246
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,631
PAM: Last one,
stinky-pinky-swear.

247
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,865
Mrowf.

248
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,866
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Psst! Pam!

249
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,969
PAM: Aw crap, already?

250
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:25,636
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): Pam!

251
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:29,673
PAM: Look, auditory hallucinations aren't
gonna make you any less delicious.

252
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:32,109
PAM: Hey! I was talking to that!

253
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,377
CHERYL/CAROL: Shhh! Shut up!
I need your help!

254
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,612
PAM: And that's how you ask?

255
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:36,280
CHERYL/CAROL: Cecil's like,
interviewing everybody!

256
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:38,849
PAM: Yeah, he -- is he?
Doing that?

257
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,151
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes! And I
think he's taping it!

258
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:41,986
Look, there's
cameras everywhere!

259
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,187
PAM: Huh.

260
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:44,755
CHERYL/CAROL: I think he's
taping them saying I'm crazy

261
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:47,825
so he can show it to a judge and
get a conservatorship over me!

262
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,493
PAM: Huh.

263
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:50,860
CHERYL/CAROL: "Huh" what?!

264
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:54,864
PAM: I mean... ya think that's
the worst idea anybody ever had?

265
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,366
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh. My God.

266
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:58,635
PAM: I know, it's hard to hear, but-
[thwap]

267
00:11:58,637 --> 00:11:59,369
PAM: Owww!

268
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:00,537
CHERYL/CAROL: I thought
you were my friend!

269
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,742
PAM: Yeah and for like six months you
also thought you were a werewolf!

270
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:08,045
Aw crap, I can't feel my face.

271
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:13,452
PAM: Last one, swear to God.

272
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:17,957
ARCHER: Swear to God, every full moon
she'd make us lock her in the ISIS vault.

273
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,491
CECIL: Oh my God, how
are you laughing?

274
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,027
That's not funny, it's tragic!

275
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,665
ARCHER: I -- no yeah, but you
know, plus time, it equals -

276
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,601
CECIL: Thank you, I've
heard quite enough.

277
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:32,838
Now if you'll please excuse me, I-
TIFFY (O.S.): Cecil? My darling whom I love?

278
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,107
TIFFY: And also strangers
whom I don't even like?

279
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,109
Our ETA is fifteen minutes.

280
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:42,181
And the seas are really choppy, so
we may be in for a rough landing.

281
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,051
CECIL: Thank you love yoooooou.

282
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,521
So you may want to
switch to coffee.

283
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:51,158
ARCHER: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ahhh.

284
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,093
Oh, you're still serious.

285
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:57,530
CHERYL/CAROL: Or am I?

286
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,566
I am, actually.

287
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:01,768
MALORY: Have you people
lost your minds?!

288
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,671
LANA: 'cause apparently it's going around...
MALORY: Because - shut up - if

289
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:09,676
we recover the bomb, I will decide if
any of you receives a tiny bonus, so -

290
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:10,778
CYRIL GILLETTE: If?! If?!

291
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,312
ARCHER: Guys, shut up,
I got this, shut up.

292
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:13,614
What do you mean, if?!

293
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,016
Also, what are we talking about?

294
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:19,854
MALORY: Nothing. There's nothing to talk
about, because I am -- Jesus Christ!

295
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,190
ARCHER: Okay, it's either

TIFFY: -- hell are you doing?!

00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:35,572
The cockpit is off
limits, missy!

Well so's my inheritance!

up John Williams!

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,116
Would a crazy person do this?!

CECIL: It's Cheryl!
She's in the cockpit!

310
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,994
I think she's trying
to kill us all!

00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:59,095
ARCHER Oh good.

312

Cheryl, open the door!

00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,811
LANA: Rrrr! Rrrk! Why the
hell's there a lock on it?!

317
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,113
CECIL: Well obviously to
prevent this exact scenario

318
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:22,983
from ever happening, but-
LANA: Now?! Really?! You think this is a

319
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:23,984
good time to be facetious?!

320
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,318
CECIL: I'm -- fairly certain you're
not using "facetious" correctlrrmp.

321
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,649
LANA: Cheryl? Can you come out here so
we can talk about this like adults?

322
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,018
Who aren't gonna die
in a helicopter crash?

323
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,688

Of all of you stupid

CECIL: [shrug]

327
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:40,794
CHERYL/CAROL (O.S.): The tapes!
It's part of his sneaky

328
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,399
plan to get a conservatorship over
me so he can steal my inheritance!

hijacked his helicopter?

I'm in charge here!

00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:06,322

sterile, that Hairy Navel

339
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,991
was mostly Kentucky Moon.

you make a Hairy Navel!

342
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:13,997
ARCHER: I know, it's a new drink, help
me think of a name, so far all I've

343
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,999
got is Horatio Cornblower.

344
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,935
Which... Okay, Pam!
Here's what's happening!

345
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,336
I'm gonna make a
small incision in

346
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,638
your trachea with this...
PAM: Grrrrk?!

CYRIL: Archer!

348
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:27,043
ARCHER: Yeah right, that's not sterile...
MALORY: Ugh! And since when do

349
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,611
you carry a switchblade?!

350
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:31,981
ARCHER: It's a long
story, Mother!

351
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,482
Neat.

352
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:36,518
Well, not so much long as
just not very interesting.

353
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,321
Okay, Pam, you with me? Then, I'm
gonna stick this in the incision,

354
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,322
and you should be good to go.

355
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:42,023
Ready?

00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,291

because you said so!

Pam, it's on the way!

00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,453
So, you think Cecil's really trying
to steal Cheryl's inheritance?

MALORY: Because...?

375
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,226

trying to get your bony manhooks

on her money for years, and
how the hell're you gonna

do that if Cecil gets it?!

and destroy the tapes there

00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,268
must be some sort of recording
device somewhere and

not work in the event of an emergency.

You're here because I wanted

you here, so I could -

totally not, by the wrrmp.

Why drag us all the way out to the

00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:53,442
LANA: The odds on which I'd put at about...
whatcha think,

449
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,877
Cecil? Fifty-to-one?

450
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,412
MALORY: Lana? What's going on?

451
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:57,446
ARCHER: Somebody shot him.

452
00:18:57,448 --> 00:19:00,048
MALORY: Will you...?
Lana, what's going on?

453
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,683
LANA: Why don't you ask Cecil?

454
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:04,085
CECIL: Ow! God, your
hands are like --ow!

455
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:08,355
Well as you may know, one of my many
philanthropic endeavors is an undersea

456
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,458
research laboratory, which, as
luck would have it, is actually

457
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,700
beneath us right now.

458
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,294
LANA: Cut. To the chase.

459
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:18,683
CECIL: Ow! Anyhoo, the lead scientist is
threatening -- well, he can tell you.

460
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:22,235
CECIL: Ahem. Captain Murphy?

461
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:24,470
[creepy music]

462
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:26,169
CHERYL/CAROL: Please tell
me you guys heard that.

463
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,256
MURPHY: Ahhhh. Mister Tunt.

464
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:30,392
CECIL: Don't worry,
he can't see us.

465
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:33,562
MURPHY: No, but I can hear you...
CECIL: Although he can hear us.

466
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:37,802
MURPHY: Yes I can, and please hear me.
For years, decades,

467
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:41,704
I have begged the so-called leaders of
the world to stop poisoning our oceans.

468
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,907
But they have ignored my pleas.

469
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:46,331
As I will ignore theirs, Mr. Tunt.

470
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,856
Unless my
list of demands is met in the next...

471
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:53,806
Tsk tsk, twelve hours. At which
point, I will launch our

472
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,684
missiles on Washington,
Miami, and New York.

473
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,544
Hope everybody has a gas mask.

474
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,478
[zzzrpt]

475
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,380
LANA: Why do they
have missiles?!

476
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,516
MALORY: And what did he
mean by "gas mask"?!

477
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:08,719
CECIL: I, you know, that was,
I think, maybe, probably,

478
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:13,558
because the missiles are definitely
tipped with VX nerve gas?

479
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,592
EVERYBODY: [gasp]

480
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:15,660
ARCHER: Oh my God!

481
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,561
LANA: What?

482
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:20,498
ARCHER: The -- it's-- the -- dammit!

483
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,869
Still can't beat
Horatio Cornblower.

484
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,270
PAM: Dicknuts!

485
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:27,506
Hrmmmff.

486
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:35,046
