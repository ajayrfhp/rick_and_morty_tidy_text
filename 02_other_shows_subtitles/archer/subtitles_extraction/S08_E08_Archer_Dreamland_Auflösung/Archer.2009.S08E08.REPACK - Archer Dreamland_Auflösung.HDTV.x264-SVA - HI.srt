Shut up, everybody!

Mother killed Woodhouse?

Oh, come on, everybody knows.

00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,070
Your partner got in too deep
on his dope bill,

The big idea is

00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:35,899
we're going to Dreamland,

35
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:37,257

No? Okay, I got one.

00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,906
Um, "sock sock."

50
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,891
And then you say "who's there?"

51
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,149
(Chuckles) Okay, then,
I guess just pout.

Okay, well think
about that statement.

124

- Strangely illogical.
- Yeah.

he was walking around

Why ya throwin' me
under the bus?

literally throw you under it,

159
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,487
I dunno,
I guess just clean livin'!

160
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:13,607
A-and how did you know
we were here?

161
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,545
I didn't! No, no, this is just

162
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,225
an almost
unbelievable coincidence.

163
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,334
No, I'm actually just here
for my blue stuff.

164
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,077
- Your what?
- Um...

165
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,522
So this is a little awkward.

166
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,592
But he's actually my patient.
(Confused reactions)

167
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,303
- I don't care what he is...
- He's a Goddamn robot!

168
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,847
- Actually...
- Nobody smashes up my club!

169
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,431
(Whistles)
(Groans)

170
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,508
Mr. Zerk!

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,615
Grrrrghh...

172
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,162
(Chuckling)
Okay, but we gotta

173
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,143
make this quick...

174
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Rarrrghh!

175
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,136
(Groans)
(Startled/impressed reactions)

176
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,545
'Cause I'm about a quart low.

177
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:46,678
A quart low on what?

178
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,732
This! He has to have it to live!

179
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:51,512
Yeah, so come on, doc,
fill 'er up.

180
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,490
Will somebody...
Archer, shoot him!

181
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,880
- What? No, he's my life's work!
- Yeah.

182
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,600
Plus it doesn't do any good.
Look.

183
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,225
Owww!
(Archer and Dutch chuckle)

184
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,320
Dammit, Archer!
You did that on purpose!

185
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:03,936
- Come on.
- Poovey: Seriously?

186
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,232
- What're you doing?
- Gettin' the hell outta here.

187
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:09,295
- Wh...? No, you're not!
- Well, ya say that...

188
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,998
Come on, man, jam it in there

189
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,756
so I can start killing
these shitheads.

190
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:13,836
(Angry/fearful reactions)

191
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:15,779
What?
No, no, that's not what I...

192
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,842
- Jam it!
- No!

193
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,092
I won't have you become

194
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,326
just another
mindless killing machine!

195
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:23,967
How, could you possibly think
you're the boss of me?

196
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,310
I'll show ya who's boss!

197
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:29,342
(Groans)
How ya like that?

198
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,169
Meh.
Well, then how about this!

199
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,560
- Oof!
- (Dutch:) Woooooo!

200
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,512
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on...

201
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,059
I'm going as fast as I can!

202
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,060
- What about me?
- What about you?

203
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,412
Get me outta here
alive, all right?

204
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:42,685
And the ransom money,

205
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,166
- we'll call it even.
- Yeah.

206
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,535
That's what you told Archer.
And look what good it did him!

207
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,903
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...
- Rrrraagghhh!

208
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:52,706
Ungh! Oh, my God,
that really hurt.

209
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:56,539
(Chuckling) Look at you, whining
like your little buddy.

210
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:57,782
My what?

211
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,584
Yeah. The little limey
dope-fiend.

212
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,953
When I gut-shot him
and left him for dead.

213
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,454
What?
(Murmured reactions)

214
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,993
Aha! Probably
on Trexler's orders!

215
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,337
What, no! I didn't...

216
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,687
He didn't tell me to do it.

217
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,041
Ow.

218
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,294
I did it just to see
his light go out.

219
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,597
Goddamn.

220
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,786
Rrrraaaagh!

221
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,068
Ungh!

222
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,895
Plus he cut me off in traffic.

223
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,927
You...
Rrrnnnngh!

224
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,950
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Grrnk!

225
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,371
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of your Adam's apple

226
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,060
grinding against your spine.

227
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,825
- Grrnk...
- No, still nothin'.

228
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,231
Hurry up!

229
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,786
Jesus, you people would stand

230
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,615
in a bread line
and ask for toast.

231
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:36,897
Wait, there's toast?

232
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:38,763
- What?
- Why would there be toast?

233
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,785
- Why wouldn't there be?
- (Krieger:) Stop it!

234
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:43,761
Stop it! Don't you see?
You're better than this!

235
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,646
You don't have to be a killer!

236
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:48,505
You can use your power
for the good of all mankind!

237
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:50,165
Yeah, I could.

238
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:52,919
But I was a murderer before you
turned me into a freak,

239
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,669
so, I don't know why you thought

240
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,677
- this was gonna have a happy ending.
- But...

241
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,544
Now go make me some blue stuff!

242
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:00,271
Ngh!

243
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,962
Is... is that your final answer?

244
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,284
(Gagging) Not if I have
to come over there.

245
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,985
(Sighs) Well, I'm very
sorry to hear that.

246
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,165
Aktion!

247
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:11,747
(Dogs barking and growling)

248
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:12,876
- Oh, God!
- What is that?

249
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,173
What-what is that?

250
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,645
Sweet Mother of God!

251
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:19,028
(Panicked reactions)

252
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,501
Wait, what is this?

253
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:21,899
(Screams)
(Dogs snarling)

254
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,571
Rrnk! Goddamn... rrnk!

255
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:27,024
(Dogs snarling and gnashing)

256
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,727
Ugh. Now I don't even know
if I want toast.

257
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,602
Aaghhh! No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait! Stop it! No!

258
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:37,212
(Chuckling) Holy shit. Glad
I don't have a flashback for that.

259
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:41,354
Down! Down! Down! Goddammit, do
these muttz even speak engl...

260
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,401
God!
Jesus Christ!

261
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:49,488
(Sniffs)
Achtung! Hunden!<i> Aus! Aus!</i>

262
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,941
- Krieger?
- I don't... hunden!<i> Aus!</i>

263
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,949
- Oh, for the...
- Rrrrgh!

264
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,462
(Startled yips)

265
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:58,066
(Low menacing growls)

266
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,965
(Tiny whispered
terrified reactions)

267
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:04,816
Why on earth would you do that?

268
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:07,129
They were ruining toast!

269
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:09,090
(Low menacing growls)

270
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,380
Somebody do something.

271
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,163
(Weary sigh) Well, I already
threw a chair, so...

272
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:20,791
Then you go do something!

273
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,999
(Startled yelp)
Archer, shoot them!

274
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,609
No! They're all I have left!

275
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,726
(Cat meows)
You don't count!

276
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,734
Rrrrghh!

277
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,312
(Barking and growling)

278
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Rrrrrrghh!

279
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,710
<i>Aus! Aus!</i>

280
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,851
Rrrghh! Grrghh!
(Snarling and gnashing)

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,670
(Assorted reactions
to the fight)

282
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:39,953
(Chuckling) Man, I don't
know who to root against.

283
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,593
They saved your life!

284
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,984
Still though.

285
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,992
(Horrified reactions)

286
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:47,038
Nooooo!

287
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,458
Rrrghh! Grrghh!
(Dog snarling and gnashing)

288
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,163
(Horrified reactions)

289
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,656
Rrgh.

290
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,888
(A wail, followed by sobbing)

291
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:01,874
(Crying)
You, you saved my life!

292
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,296
Rrgh...

293
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:07,788
And was it...
Was it because you love me?

294
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:09,695
Rrrgh.
Oh, my God.

295
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,335
That is... without a doubt,

296
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,648
the saddest thing
I have ever heard.

297
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:15,734
Rgh?

298
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,788
I mean, in what kind
of crazy dream-world

299
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,546
could we ever possibly
be together?

300
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,546
(Archer chuckling)

301
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:23,992
Jesus Christ.

302
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:27,281
- Should've shot her when I had the chance.
- Okay, well,

303
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:30,048
everything seems under control
here, so we'll just, um...

304
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

305
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,326
- Yeah. With my money!
- With my money!

306
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,493
Well, thanks a lot, T-man!

307
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,894
- What?
- Drop the bag.

308
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,563
What did you call her?

309
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,498
- T-man...
- Oh, hey, uh...

310
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,204
- But-But it's not what you think...
- Hey!

311
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,171
- It-It means Treasury Agent...
- Hey!

312
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:48,734
Oh. Although right about now I'm
guessing she wishes it didn't.

313
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,546
- Son of a...
- Treasury agent?

314
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,346
- Look...
- No, you look!

315
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:53,602
(Tense/wary reactions)

316
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,296
Hey, be careful, it's got a...

317
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,178
- Zip it!
- I...

318
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,429
- I can explain!
- Yes.

319
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:59,070
Please explain
what you've been doing

320
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,632
in my bar for the past year.

321
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,843
Because either you were
moonlighting as a singer

322
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,155
just to make ends meet
on a government salary,

323
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,968
or you were working undercover
to bring me down!

324
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:11,294
Or both!
Dun-dun-dun!

325
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,531
- Not helping!
- But if I were undercover,

326
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,312
obviously my agency would
be in the know,

327
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,946
and so if anything
happened to me, you'd...

328
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:21,390
(gunshot)

329
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:24,273
(Groans)
Lana! What the shit, Mother?

330
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,531
I, I didn't mean to! This damn
thing's got a hair trigger!

331
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,773
That's what I was trying
to tell you! When?

332
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:30,714
Before!

333
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,555
Hair trigger my ass, gimme that!

334
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,050
(Gunshot)
Oh, shit!

335
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,913
(Groans)
Lana!

336
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:37,617
Man, that is a hair trigger.

337
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,989
Goddammit, Poovey!

338
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:40,538
How was that my fault?

339
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:43,242
- La-Lana!
- Archer?

340
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:45,523
Shhh. You're gonna be okay.

341
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,578
Somebody call an ambulance!

342
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,335
Ugh. I already threw a chair.

343
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:52,156
Archer...

344
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:54,187
I'm sorry.

345
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,695
Why-why-why are you sorry?

346
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,874
I got blood on you.

347
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:02,968
Well, I blew a load
on your dress, so...

348
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,163
(gunshot) Ungh! Poovey!

349
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,575
I'm sorry! I...
(Gunshot)

350
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,163
(Startled/annoyed reactions)
Poovey!

351
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,745
Goddammit! I...
(Gunshot)

352
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,606
- Drop the Goddamn gun!
- Okay! (Gunshot)

353
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,786
(Angry reactions)

354
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,323
(Long, weary sigh)

355
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,541
(Scared whisper)
Is she...

356
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:21,815
Yes! (Big exhale) Whew!

357
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,323
- What?
- What? I was asking if she's okay.

358
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,792
(Irritated reactions)

359
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:30,214
No, Poovey, she is the exact
opposite of okay! She's dead!

360
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:32,206
Because she got shot seven times

361
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,821
and nobody could possibly
survive that!

362
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,776
Not even in a parallel universe!

363
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,117
What the hell
are you looking at?

364
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,781
No, just...
Okay, so she's dead.

365
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:48,844
Yes! She's dead!
Forever and ever!

366
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,922
On infinite (Bleep) Earths!

367
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,437
_(Speaks German)

368
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,359
_(Speaks German)

369
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,406
Shut up!
And gimme that!

370
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,703
- Poovey, I'm giving you half.
- Of the money?

371
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:05,786
- Wait a minute!
- Are you nuts?

372
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,219
But you have to promise to set

373
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,922
those Chinese ladies
up in business.

374
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,430
Oh, my God,
I've got so many ideas!

375
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,405
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

376
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,367
who says you get to decide
who gets the money?

377
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,219
John Moses Browning.

378
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,555
Well, news flash,
mister tough and smart guy,

379
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,352
you're out of ammo!

380
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,953
Wh... get him!

381
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,793
Duh-huh.

382
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,509
(Weary sigh)
Goddammit.

383
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:33,930
What?
What is it?

384
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,405
There's no money.

385
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:39,969
Just these weird German nudie
mags about sports and...

386
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,411
Implied incest.

387
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,086
(Cecil:)
There's no incest!

388
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,516
They're all just
really happy to be together,

389
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,305
- and outside, and...
- (Trinette:) Naked.

390
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:50,016
Well, and healthy. As a family.

391
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:52,406
Whatever.
Now is not the time.

392
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,258
Oh, right.
Sorry, father. Please continue.

393
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:58,273
(Clears throat)
And do you, Cecil,

394
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,328
take Trinette to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

395
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,044
Mmmmmm...

396
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,945
Ow! I do!

397
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:07,797
(Weary sigh)

398
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,771
So, I guess I'll see you around.

399
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,440
And so that's pretty much that,
I guess. Vengeance-wise.

400
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,877
And I, I don't know
if you feel avenged,

401
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,166
or... if that even matters to you.

402
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:41,468
Tell you what I do know,
is robot dogs? Jesus Christ.

403
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,510
And I know the case took a long
time, but like you always said,

404
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,401
I have a tendency to get
sidetracked.

405
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,619
Which, honestly,
was kinda shitty of you.

406
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:56,064
And the smart thing would've
been to read your envelope

407
00:16:56,088 --> 00:17:00,549
full of clues and then start
rampaging, but... holy shit,

408
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:02,580
I wonder if that was your will.

409
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,893
Although I can't imagine
you having anything

410
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,659
that I would possibly want.

411
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:09,448
I mean, I'll swing
by your apartment

412
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:11,570
and take a look
around, but uh...

413
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:17,565
What else, what else?
Oh, I brought you some heroin.

414
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,565
Hopefully some kids won't
walk by and eat it.

415
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,944
Oh, and also, uh, a rock.

416
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,532
I didn't know
if you were Jewish.

417
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,955
We never talked about that.

418
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:29,580
I guess mainly because you were
so weirdly private.

419
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:32,547
But even so, Woodhouse.

420
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,430
Oh, I'm gonna miss
the shit outta you.

421
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,065
(Deep sigh)
All right, I'll see ya.

422
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:46,393
I dunno, next week, or...

423
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,028
Uh, you know what,
let's play it by ear.

424
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,276
What the...
Hello?

425
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,752
Hello?

426
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,916
Hey, where the hell
are you guys?

427
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:24,303
Hello? Hello?
Wait, what's this?

428
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:28,574
