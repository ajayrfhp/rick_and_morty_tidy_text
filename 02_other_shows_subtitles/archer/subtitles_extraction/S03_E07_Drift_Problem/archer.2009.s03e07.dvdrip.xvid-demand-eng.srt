1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,548
Oh, God.

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:07,337
ARCHER: Ugh, no, forget the glass,
Woodhouse, just gimme the pitcher...

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,528
For I am a sinner in the
hands of an angry God.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,142
Bloody Mary, full of vodka, blessed
are you among cocktails...

5
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:20,123
Pray for me, now and at the hour of
my death, which I hope is soon, amen.

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:26,806
WOODHOUSE: Er, perhaps a coddled egg...
ARCHER: No. No eggs, Woodhouse.

7
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:28,076
Maybe ever again.

8
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,545
WOODHOUSE: Some dry toast?

9
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,846
ARCHER: Yeah, or you could skip a
step and just feed me some vomit.

10
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:34,652
WOODHOUSE: Not like you
to get a hangover, sir.

11
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:36,153
ARCHER: Yeah, I don't
know what happened.

12
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:41,959
I kinda remember being at the wake...
MALORY: Oh, you poor dear.

13
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:45,563
On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents,
please let me be the first to

14
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:47,330
offer my condolences.

15
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:52,368
ARCHER: And let me be the first to
welcome you back into the dating pool.

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,638
(burp) And-or-also my
new, hic, hot tub.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,775
But after that it's just... snippets.

18
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:01,913
I think I had one more drink there...
EVERYBODY: Drink, drink, drink, drink!

19
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:07,753
ARCHER: And then I think I took a cab...
Hang on, wait, lemme see some hands!

20
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:11,056
Who wants chicken and waffles?!

21
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:13,325
How did we bring food in here?!

22
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,728
Oh, and also, did we
lose some people?!

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,830
PAM: Lana'n Cyril bailed!

24
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,299
Triflin bitches!

25
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,036
Here! Less yer a triflin bitch too!

26
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:26,606
ARCHER: Agh!
What'd I just put inside me?!

27
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:27,774
PAM: Green Russians!

28
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:33,380
It's absinthe and...
Milk, sweet shitsnacks lookit those!

29
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,750
ARCHER: Oh! My! God!

30
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:36,651
That's right!

31
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,956
It's somewhat coming back to me!

32
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,824
PAM: Woooo!

33
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,293
I'm Pacman Jones!

34
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,895
ARCHER: Come home with me!

35
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:46,965
Plus my valet will
give you some heroin!

36
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,834
WOODHOUSE: Thankfully I
didn't have to share.

37
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,704
ARCHER: But she did,
she came home with me!

38
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:52,372
I remember!

39
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:55,575
I mean, Green Russians, it's
fuzzy, I don't remember this...

40
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:59,346
But I do remember her being the
best sex I've ever had in my life!

41
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:02,150
WOODHOUSE: Er --
ARCHER: Shut up, and that includes Europe, Lana,

44
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:07,989
WOODHOUSE: Sir...?

45
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,890
ARCHER: Phone number?!

46
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:09,391
Matchbook?!

47
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:12,928
I don't know her name, where she works...
Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her?!

48
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,896
WOODHOUSE: Ahem.

49
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:15,531
You might check the loo.

50
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,465
ARCHER: What, here?!

51
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,799
Why didn't you say so?!

52
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,067
WOODHOUSE: Oww!

53
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,903
ARCHER: Oww!

54
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:27,142
Ow, ow, ow... Uh, so hey, hi.

55
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:31,413
I'm Sterling Archer, you may
remember me from the strip club,

56
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,417
and hopefully also from what was
hands down the most incredible

57
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,520
sex that I personally have ever had.

58
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:45,597
Hello? Oh right, so I know we had an
implied oral agreement about heroin...

59
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,464
PAM: Heroin?!

60
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,098
ARCHER: Wh-?!

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,535
PAM: That's the last
frickin thing I need.

62
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,372
I'm bound up tighter'n dick's hatband.

63
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:57,576
ARCHER: No, not...
were you...? Did we...?

64
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,744
PAM: Yeah, we did.

65
00:02:58,746 --> 00:02:59,978
And you loved it!

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,314
ARCHER: [incoherent gibberish]

67
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,450
KATHUMP!

68
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,402
[FART]

69

70
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,642
PAM: Okay, jeez, I get it!

71
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,620
ARCHER: Well, you say that, but
I worry that you think I'm

72
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:47,924
exaggerating when I say...
PAM: That I was the best sex you ever had?

73
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:52,629
ARCHER: No... That if anybody ever finds
out about it, I will literally -

74
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,566
Pam, look at me-
I will literally murder you.

75
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,036
PAM: Not literally...
ARCHER: Yes literally!

76
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,872
You will wake up in three
separate fifty-gallon drums!

77
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,641
PAM: That's a hundred
and fifty gallons.

78
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:08,979
Of Pam's hot, dirty, ball-slappiney...
ARCHER: Gaaghh!

79
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,215
PAM: Come at me bro!

80
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:18,422
How ya gonna keep 'em, down on the
farm, after they seen Pam-ee?

81
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,894
ARCHER: Yeah, how're you gonna...
I mean, my God, you can't,

82
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,363
that, that was just --
MALORY: Disgusting!

83
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,900
And I hoped I would never have to say
this, but you finally topped your

84
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,803
tenth grade sports banquet!

85
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:34,840
ARCHER: I -- okay first of all,
Mrs. Coach Mumford came on to me.

86
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,243
And second of all...
what're we talking about?

87
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,912
MALORY: Hitting on your
dead colleague's widow?!

88
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,147
At his own wake?!

89
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,482
ARCHER: Oh, that.

90
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:45,852
- Okay, so...
- So help me God, Sterling, sometimes I think

91
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:48,288
that I've failed as a mother.

92
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,322
ARCHER: Sometimes?

93
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:52,125
MALORY: Oh shut up, and the last
thing you need is another drink.

94
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,862
LANA: Ugh, seriously, how can you
be drinking after last night?

95
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:56,763
ARCHER: How can you not?

96
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:59,566
LANA: Because I don't have a problem.

97
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,904
MALORY: Well, I do...
ARCHER: First step's admitting it, Mother.

98
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:03,538
MALORY: Wh-?

99
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,672
Not with drinking!

100
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:08,343
ARCHER: Eh... LANA: Eh...
MALORY: My problem, besides your snide remarks

101
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,080
is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.

102
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,416
LANA: And also possibly
Archer's father.

103
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:13,950
ARCHER: Wh-?

104
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:15,718
MALORY: How do you know about that?!

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,287
LANA: Because I'm part of Everybody?

106
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,356
MALORY: Damn that blabbermouthing Pam...
ARCHER: Why, what'd she say?!

107
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:24,828
Besides the stuff about Jakov, which
obviously is what you meant, so...

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,831
MALORY: So, Nikolai has been dropping
hints that he may want to defect.

109
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,498
ARCHER: What?!

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,199
LANA: That's awesome!

111
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,767
MALORY: I think you mean awful.

112
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,470
LANA: Uh, ISIS getting an
inside look at every single

113
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,305
KGB operation in the world?

114
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:36,507
And that's awful how?

115
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,577
MALORY: Because he thinks he's
going to move in with me!

116
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,613
Me, who happens to be in a
relationship with Burt Reynolds,

117
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:44,548
in case you've forgotten?

118
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,183
ARCHER: I actually did forget that.

119
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:47,952
LANA: Yeah, I never see you together.

120
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,787
I mean, are you like dating, or...?

121
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,155
MALORY: It's... complicated.

122
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:56,060
What with our work schedules, and...
work, it's hard to find time

123
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,394
for actual dates.

124
00:05:57,396 --> 00:06:01,532
LANA: But you do see one another...
MALORY: Well yes of course, but --

125
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:03,100
ARCHER: But never in public, right?

126
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:07,038
Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or...
PAM: Or on the dirty floor in

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,039
the elevator?

128
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,274
MALORY: Wh-? Pam!

129
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:14,079
Get your bloated carcass --
ARCHER: Out, I got it, I'm on this I got it!

130
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,214
MALORY: How did she know
about the elevator?

131
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:17,215
LANA: I -- ew.

132
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,785
MALORY: Burt made sure I
erased the security tape.

133
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:25,723
Wait, could -- you don't think
Burt's ashamed to be seen with me?

134
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:26,390
Lana.

135
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,225
LANA: I'm sorry?

136
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:30,394
ARCHER: Well I'm sorry, but if anybody
ever found out I'd die of shame!

137
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:33,364
PAM: Well how do ya think
that makes me feel?!

138
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,832
ARCHER: I don't care Pam!

139
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,869
Now, having said that, would
you please come in this

140
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,238
dirty toilet stall and
have sex with me.

141
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,574
PAM: Ugh, oh alright!

142
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,276
But this time get in there.

143
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,511
All ya been doin' is givin'

144
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,946
one side hell.

145
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,282
BARRY: Well, when you put it like
that it sounds kinda shitty.

146
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,252
JAKOV: Thirty years of my
life I giff to the KGB?!

147
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:56,989
End now you, this, this
traitorous cyborg?!

148
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,958
Are seeting et my desk?!

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,326
How would you put it?!

150
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:03,095
BARRY: Yeah, you really
got cornholed, huh?

151
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:06,531
Wait, don't answer yet, because I'm
also reassigning you to Siberia.

152
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,899
JAKOV: Wh-?! Siberia?!

153
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:10,502
BARRY: Barry can't have you
moping around here, you know...

154
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,771
sowing the discontent!

155
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:13,972
BORIS: Is bad for morale.

156
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,940
JAKOV: Et tu, Brute?!

157
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,375
BORIS: Et me, buddy.

158
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:18,109
JAKOV: Rrrrrgh!

159
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:19,944
BARRY: So here's my advice
to you: dress in layers.

160
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:24,282
And don't even think about doing
anything crazy like defecting...

161
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,984
JAKOV: I would never defect!

162
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,686
I love Mother Russia!

163
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:31,089
BARRY: Even when you're chopping through
the ice in the toilet so you can poop?

164
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,091
I'm kidding, obviously.

165
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:36,195
You'll be like, six hundred
miles from a toilet.

166
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,397
ARCHER: Sorry, had to go to the
bathroom, nothing unusual,

167
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,268
just uh, you know, normal,
um, bodily waste excretion.

168
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,770
MALORY: If you're quite finished...
ARCHER: Damn near.

169
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:48,374
MALORY:... then go home, sober up, and
make sure your apartment is secure.

170
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:49,542
ARCHER: Uh, why?

171
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:50,543
To all three of those?

172
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,946
MALORY: Because if and when
Nikolai shows up here,

173
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:56,650
he's not staying at my place...
ARCHER: Well, he's not staying with me!

174
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,218
MALORY: Then go prep the safehouse.

175
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,255
Because you can bet every KGB
agent and freelance assassin

176
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:06,660
this side of Berlin will be
hunting him down like a dog.

177
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:07,728
ARCHER: Who hunts dogs?

178
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,799
CHERYL/CAROL: Orientals, duh!

179
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,644
BARRY: So when you say you assume
Jakov got on that train to Siberia,

180
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,612
you know what you're doing?

181
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,826
BORIS: I mek you ess.

182
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,984
BARRY: And Barry doesn't like!

183
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,651
Being made an ass, he really doesn't.

184
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,589
And as you can -- well it's over there
now, but the telex from the Siberia

185
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,149
desk says Jakov never showed up!

186
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,294
Now why do you think that might be?!

187
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:36,296
BORIS: Ummm...
JAKOV: Thenk you, Boris!

188
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,732
I wun't forget this!

189
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:42,202
BORIS: I promised myself I don't cry.

190
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:44,103
Promise broke.

191
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,038
BARRY: What was that?

192
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,173
BORIS: Ellergies?

193
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:51,710
BARRY: To what, making sure
people get on trains?!

194
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,378
Nice one other Barry.

195
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,715
Now Jakov's got a twelve-hour head start,
and the details of every single

196
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:01,318
KGB operation on the globe in
his fat, combed-over head!

197
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,087
BORIS: Da, end we hef
no idea where he went!

198
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,956
BARRY: Well I assume he's
in New York, with those

199
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,124
shitbitchingassbastard Archers!

200
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,492
BORIS: But...
BARRY: I can assume!

201
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,595
You're already an ass!

202
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:15,566
So contact our sleeper in New York and
then cancel all my meetings this week,

203
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,136
because I will also be in New York.

204
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:20,005
Murdering people.

205
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,174
JAKOV: Eh, dunt tek this the wrung way?

206
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:26,612
But I pictured you
having nicer apartment.

207
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:27,580
[Laughter]

208
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,049
Why thet is funny?

209
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:32,853
MALORY: Hm? Oh no, sorry, there's
a funny Marmaduke on the fridge.

210
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:33,454
JAKOV: A what?

211
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:38,226
MALORY: And this is actually,
ahem, the ISIS safehouse, cheers!

212
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,228
JAKOV: Safehouse?

213
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,765
But Melory, I assumed...
MALORY: Which you shouldn't have!

214
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,569
What, you thought you'd just show up out
of the blue and we'd move in together?

215
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,704
JAKOV: Pretty much, yeah.

216
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:53,676
MALORY: Nikolai, it's not that I don't-
am not very fond of you, I mean,

217
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:58,481
we have such history together, and...
JAKOV: End mebbe a son?

218
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:02,050
MALORY: Mmmmaybe, but...
JAKOV: But so?

219
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,184
Where is he?

220
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,552
LANA: Good question.

221
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,121
He was supposed to prep this dump...
GILLETTE: And didn't.

222
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,523
LANA: -- and now he's supposed to be
here for the first shift of guard duty.

223
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,424
CYRIL: And isn't.

224
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:14,093
JAKOV: Uh -- LANA: Hi, Lana Kane, you
must be Major Jakov, such a pleasure,

225
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,096
be a lamb and take
those to the kitchen?

226
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:17,463
So.

227
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:20,199
I think I speak for all of us
when I say we shouldn't be the

228
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,435
only ones guarding
your maybe-baby-daddy.

229
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:28,174
MALORY: I can't believe you all know about that...
JAKOV: Wow, thet is big dog!

230
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,008
MALORY: Marmaduke.

231
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,078
And regardless of any...
personal ties I may have with Nikolai,

232
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,081
he's a invaluable asset and
we have to protect him!

233
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,619
I mean, you know...
at least until he's been debriefed.

234
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,386
LANA: And then?

235
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,321
What, he's on his own?

236
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:44,125
MALORY: Um...
LANA: Wow.

237
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,960
ARCHER: I'm serious, you are literally
draining the life out of me.

238
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:51,899
PAM: C'mon, you make me sound like some kinda...
chupacabra, but for dicks.

239
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,869
ARCHER: A terrifying yet
accurate comparison.

240
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,237
Where did you learn all that stuff?

241
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,240
PAM: You know I grew
up on a farm, right?

242
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,643
ARCHER: Really hoping
that's not relevant.

243
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,645
WOODHOUSE: Ms. Kane... and your mother.

244
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,047
ARCHER: Hooray...
PAM: I gotta bounce.

245
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,315
Later taters.

246
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,519
ARCHER: Lana listen, if this is a
booty call, I'm flattered, but --

247
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:11,220
LANA: Oh my God.

248
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,888
MALORY: You're supposed
to be guarding Nikolai!

249
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,093
ARCHER: Yeah, so about that, I mean, don't
you think that's gonna be..kinda...

250
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:19,963
JAKOV: [sniffling, weeping]

251
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:20,797
ARCHER: Awkward?

252
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,499
CYRIL: I actually think
it's kinda sweet.

253
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,233
ARCHER: Little help?

254
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,001
LANA: No, you're good.

255
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:26,603
The camera's set up for the debriefing,
and one of us will relieve you

256
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,038
in like, eight hours?

257
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,440
ARCHER: Wait, where
are you guys going?!

258
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:30,874
GILLETTE: Uh, a town called work?

259
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:34,345
LANA: Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in
Brooklyn, thanks to this intel from the

260
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:35,012
major.

261
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:36,947
JAKOV: It was least I could do.

262
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,083
LANA: Since otherwise he'd kill you?

263
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,417
JAKOV: Is win-win.

264
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:45,022
LANA: Is it?

265
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,990
JAKOV: So!

266
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:47,857
ARCHER: Yeah.

267
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:49,526
JAKOV: Sterlink!

268
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:50,360
ARCHER: Yeah.

269
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,661
JAKOV: Is long time.

270
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:55,064
ARCHER: Yeah, when was... oh!
I guess when I was in the

271
00:11:55,066 --> 00:12:00,303
dreaded Lubyanka with jumper
cables clamped to my balls!

272
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:05,307
JAKOV: So <i>da</i>, this is...
a little awkward.

273
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,308
ARCHER: Yeah.

274
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,309
JAKOV: Maybe some shots?

275
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,512
ARCHER: Yeah let's try that!

276
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:16,118
LANA: Any time now... Cyril. Cyril!

277
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,222
CYRIL: Lana, I -- I don't
think I'm cut out for this.

278
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:22,524
LANA: Well, don't take this the wrong
way, but neither does anyone else.

279
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,360
Just pretend he's, like, a rabid dog.

280
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,429
CYRIL: Oh God, just like Old Yeller!

281
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:30,699
GILLETTE: Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big
stack of KGB codebooks and fif - forty

282
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,501
thousand bucks in a floor safe.

283
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,971
LANA: And was also identified as a
sleeper agent by the head of the KGB!

284
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,172
KGB AGENT: Who, Barry?!

285
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:37,773
LANA: What?

286
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:38,507
KGB AGENT: White?

287
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,608
You guys like smooth R&B?

288
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,108
GILLETTE: Duh.

289
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,147
LANA: Are you telling me Barry "The Bionic
Douchebag" Dylan is running the KGB?

290
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,749
KGB AGENT: Only if I can defect, too.

291
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,352
Because that dude is
out of his damn mind.

292
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,854
LANA: I'm listening.

293
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:53,121
KGB AGENT: He's crazy!

294
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:57,559
I mean he's smart, way smarter than Jakov,
but -- oh, and you can bet Jakov's

295
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,627
intel is bad!

296
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:59,261
LANA: Really?

297
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,396
This isn't your kneecap?

298
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:01,630
KGB AGENT: Don't you get it?

299
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:04,600
Barry gave me up so you'd
trust Jakov on the rest!

300
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:09,171
He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so...
LANA: So he's been feeding him fake intel?

301
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:10,372
KGB AGENT: I mean I assume!

302
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,041
Because Barry's got a master
plan, which, when you hear it,

303
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:18,245
will probably make your head explo...
LANA: Jesus! GILLETTE: Jesus!

304
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:19,279
LANA: Ahem. Cyril?

305
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,447
CYRIL: I'm sorry!

306
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,815
LANA: Yes.

307
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,484
Yes you are.

308
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,653
JAKOV: Is I who em sorry!

309
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,055
I should hef been there for you!

310
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:33,994
ARCHER: Shut up, don't do that, I mean
what were you gonna do, marry my mother?

311
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,262
Have you met her?

312
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:35,762
Oww!

313
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:39,132
JAKOV: Dun't you ever disrespect her!

314
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,936
ARCHER: You're not my dad!

315
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,172
[Laughter]

316
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,741
JAKOV: How would you know?!

317
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,209
ARCHER: I know, right?!

318
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,481
JAKOV: But I hef to say,
you dun't look like me!

319
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:57,619
ARCHER: And don't take this the
wrong way, but thank Christ!

320
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:58,620
Oww!

321
00:13:58,622 --> 00:13:59,521
CHERYL/CAROL: Watch it!

322
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,055
You dumb idiot!

323
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,089
BARRY: Oh man, I am so sorry!

324
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,760
Here, lemme get you some...
oh my God, Cheryl?

325
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,061
CHERYL/CAROL: Barry?!

326
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:08,597
BARRY: Wow, I was hoping
I'd bump into you!

327
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,431
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, really?

328
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,266
BARRY: And darn if I didn't!

329
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:11,934
Literally!

330
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:15,237
CHERYL/CAROL: You -- wait a minute, why
am I thinking you live in like, Russia?

331
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,206
BARRY: Mmmmaybe the tracksuit?

332
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,476
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh, right, and which, by
the way, you are totally rockiiiing.

333
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:24,446
BARRY: Oh, that's just...
my huge muscles.

334
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,649
CHERYL/CAROL: So tell me...
how strong are you?

335
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,917
BARRY: Insanely, wanna get outta here?

336
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,485
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, totally,
but like it has to be

337
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,854
your place, because mine
reeks of ocelot piss.

338
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:37,723
BARRY: I have no response to that...
CHERYL/CAROL: Doesn't merit one.

339
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:41,526
BARRY:... and my place is currently flooding so...
CHERYL/CAROL: Hotel?

340
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:42,861
BARRY: Damn, no money.

341
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,329
Tracksuit, no pockets.

342
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,130
CHERYL/CAROL: Damn it!

343
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,666
BARRY: I know, it's the
one single drawback.

344
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,368
Wait, doesn't ISIS have a safehouse?

345
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,904
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but...
You have promise that all that

346
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:56,107
horrific stuff I think I remember
about you is just false memories?

347
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,309
BARRY: I...
CHERYL/CAROL: Because I get those a lot.

348
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,279
BARRY: Cross the microchip in my heart.

349
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,447
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't
get all girly on me.

350
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,515
Check!

351
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,098
MALORY: Hold the door!

352
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:08,371
Hold the door!

353
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,855
PAM: Headin out?

354
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:13,392
MALORY: No, I thought I'd just take all
my things for a ride on the elevator.

355
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:14,493
PAM: Okay.

356
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,162
MALORY: I actually have a date.

357
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,396
With Burt Reynolds.

358
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:18,665
We're watching Gator.

359
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,532
PAM: Your place?

360
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:23,536
MALORY: Well if we go out, you
know, he's just mobbed, so...

361
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:27,440
PAM: So it's a DVD, a box of wine and
some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.

362
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:27,974
MALORY: No!

363
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,176
Well, it's not a box of wine.

364
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:36,282
Pam, let me ask you something...
JAKOV: How ken you just leave me here?!

365
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:39,953
ARCHER: Mainly because I have an
incredibly addictive personality.

366
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:43,256
So just debrief yourself with the
camera, and when I get back we'll talk

367
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:47,060
about the DNA test thing, if, ya
know, you're still into doing that.

368
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,263
JAKOV: Of course I em still into thet!

369
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,433
But in meantime, you
think I will be safe?

370
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,402
ARCHER: God, what's Russian for duh?

371
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,469
It's a safehouse!

372
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,871
Nobody knows where it is!

373
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,807
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, here it is!

374
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,608
BARRY: Neat.

375
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,176
Can I see your neck a minute?

376
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:09,585
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh, Barry...
Barry? Barry!

377
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:12,955
Barrryyyygrrghhh!

378
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:15,958
PAM: ... my point is, if you're
confident in yourself as a woman,

379
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,494
who cares if he wants
to keep it on the DL?

380
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,363
MALORY: Well yes, but...
PAM: But nothin!

381
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:24,500
Because who's to say you're
not using him for sex?

382
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,802
MALORY: Pam, don't take
this the wrong way?

383
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:29,504
But you're not nearly
as stupid as you look.

384
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,906
PAM: Okay.

385
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,640
ARCHER: Mmmyello?

386
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,542
LANA: Archer don't talk, just listen!

387
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,410
ARCHER: Why, what's up?

388
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,946
What're you -- LANA: Jakov's intel is bad
and Barry's got some sort of master

389
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:41,684
plan that we're clueless about, thanks to Cyril --
CYRIL: Who has apologized

390
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:43,486
profusely...
GILLETTE: Quiet game!

391
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:48,024
LANA: -- so we're gonna regroup at the
safehouse and try to... figure out...

392
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:48,659
God damn it.

393
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:49,359
GILLETTE: What.

394
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,095
LANA: Wait for it.

395
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,663
ARCHER: Ha ha haaaa!

396
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:57,668
Leave it!

397
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,736
JAKOV: <i>Da, da!</i>

398
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,204
<i>Keep your shirt on!</i>

399
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,708
<i>BARRY: Barry doesn't wear a shirt.</i>

400
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,111
<i>Ruins Barry's whole tracksuit vibe.</i>

401
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,413
<i>MALORY: I swear to God, if
he put as much effort into</i>

402
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:12,783
<i>his job as he does into
those idiot voicemails...</i>

403
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,585
<i>and you say got this
from a KGB sleeper?</i>

404
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,520
<i>LANA: Right before Cyril
blew his head off.</i>

405
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:18,755
<i>MALORY: What?!</i>

406
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:25,528
<i>JAKOV: You son of bitch, you
ektually think you will get away with this?!</i>

407
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>BARRY: Obviously!</i>

408
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,097
<i>Why else would I do it?</i>

409
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,933
<i>JAKOV: Who knows with
you, you're crezzy!</i>

410
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,769
<i>BARRY: Am I?!</i>

411
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,572
<i>Between Archer ruining my life
and you dicks turning me into</i>

412
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:39,676
<i>a cyborg, I'm kind of
amazed I'm even this sane.</i>

413
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:42,278
<i>Which is obviously a
relative term, but --</i>

414
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,380
<i>JAKOV: What are you doing?</i>

415
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,048
<i>BARRY: Rationalizing my behavior.</i>

416
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,049
<i>JAKOV: With gess.</i>

417
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,184
<i>BARRY: Oh.</i>

418
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,418
<i>Killing you.</i>

419
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,254
<i>JAKOV: Oh.</i>

420
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:54,225
<i>BARRY: Oh, Marmaduke...
JAKOV: End gess is nut so bad</i>

421
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:57,228
<i>way to die...
BARRY: Well again, relative term.</i>

422
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,031
<i>JAKOV: End efterwerd,
if Sterlink want,</i>

423
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,800
<i>he ken still get some
DNA from my body,</i>

424
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:05,369
<i>end find out if I em his real father.</i>

425
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:07,705
<i>BARRY: Which I'm sure would
provide him with some</i>

426
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:11,342
<i>much-needed closure...
Which is why it's not gonna happen.</i>

427
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,077
<i>JAKOV: Why, what is thet?</i>

428
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,514
<i>BARRY: This - glad you asked -
is a block of ice with a fork</i>

429
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:17,114
<i>frozen in it.</i>

430
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,750
<i>JAKOV: What are you doing with it?</i>

431
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:22,587
<i>BARRY: I am putting this
fork-filled block of ice in this</i>

00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,124
<i>microwave oven... Now I'm setting
the timer for five -- Oh heck,</i>

433
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:29,059
<i>let's call it ten minutes.</i>

434
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,961
<i>Doesn't matter, ice can't tell time.</i>

435
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:34,565
<i>JAKOV: It ken unly melt...
BARRY: And when it does...</i>

436
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:39,103
<i>JAKOV: Spark from fork, gas from stuv...
BARRY: Booom.</i>

437
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:43,141
<i>JAKOV: End no DNA left for papa test...
BARRY: Nope.</i>

438
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:44,409
<i>Just uncertainty and doubt.</i>

439
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:48,480
<i>Which hopefully, over time, will
eventually drive Archer insane.</i>

is your mester plen?</i>
