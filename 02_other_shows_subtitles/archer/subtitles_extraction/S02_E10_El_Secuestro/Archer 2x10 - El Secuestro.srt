1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,850
PAM: So then he's all like "Ya
gotta go before my roommate

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,014
gets home" and I'm like "Who cares?"
and he's like...

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:12,434
CHERYL/CAROL: You're a moped.

4
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,771
How do you know?
What's it mean anyway?

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,521
Mopeds are fun, but you don't want
your buddies to see you riding one.

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:21,157
PAM: Ohhh...
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah.

7
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:23,460
PAM: I thought he meant
I was fuel-efficient.

8
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,809
I only had ten beers.

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,730
CHERYL/CAROL: Fourties?
PAM: No!

10
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:28,665
Yes. Hence the shandy.

11
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,464
My head feels like a bunch of monkies
fighting over a bucket of marbles.

12
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:36,807
Stick that horn in your ass!

13
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,142
Nutsack.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,692
MALORY: And what time is it?

15
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:44,072
CYRIL: Well it's 9:01, but...
MALORY: And what time is late?

16
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:49,036
CYRIL: Technically 9:01, also, but I'm
sure Cheryl has a good excuse this time.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,392
MALORY: Oh right, like the
time her ocelot was sick!

18
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,194
Or yesterday, when she said she had to
walk to work because there was a midget

19
00:00:58,262 --> 00:00:59,663
on the train!

20
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:03,833
CYRIL: I think she said it was a dwarf...
MALORY: And I said that was her last chance!

21
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,567
She's fired.

22
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,570
I want her desk cleaned out
and a new secretary by lunch.

23
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:10,974
CYRIL: That's kinda more Pam's department...
MALORY: Who is also late!

24
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:14,620
And I just can't wait to
hear that lame excuse...

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,181
KIDNAPPER 3: Just get
her in the damn van!

26
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,565
KIDNAPPER 2: She's
crazy frickin strong!

27
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,686
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah!
You fight 'em off, Cheryl!

28
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:23,920
PAM: Wh-? ! Cheryl?!

29
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:26,456
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes!
That's you! You're Cheryl!

30
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,725
PAM: What? ! What're you...

31
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,894
KIDNAPPER 1: Aaaghh!
I swear to God I'm blind!

32
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,230
KIDNAPPER 3: C'mon, the boss is waiting!
We don't need her!

33
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:37,434
CHERYL/CAROL: Because I'm
just her stupid friend!

34
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,269
She's who you want!

35
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:40,704
PAM: Cheryyyyl!

36
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,708
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes, just keep
shouting your own name!

37
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:45,809
PAM: What're you...

38
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,711
CHERYL/CAROL: I'll
pray for you, Cheryl!

39
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:50,363
PAM: Goddammit, I'm not...

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,565
CHERYL/CAROL: Whew!

41
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,987
Well that was a close one.

42
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,155
Ugh. And thank Pam.
Way to drag out a kidnapping.

43
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,757
Now I'm late again.

44
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:03,793
Although this is a way better
excuse than the train-dwarf.

45
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,489
Which... ick.

46
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:17,546
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

47
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:44,419
MALORY: Kidnapped.

48
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,144
CHERYL/CAROL: Like a huge,
sweatery Lindbergh baby.

49
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,857
So it's really Pam's
fault I'm late.

50
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:51,007
MALORY: Why would anyone...
ARCHER: In the world...

51
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,836
MALORY:... want to kidnap Pam?

52
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:56,572
CHERYL/CAROL: There's a... teeny-tiny chance
they maybe might've thought Pam was me?

53
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:57,684
LANA: How?
CHERYL/CAROL: No idea.

54
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,986
MALORY: Well, even if you weren't lying...
CHERYL/CAROL: The train-dwarf

55
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:03,485
was real and he looked right at
me with his dwarfy eyeballs!

56
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,801
MALORY: Why would anyone
want to kidnap you?

57
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:12,824
CHERYL/CAROL: Because my last name
isn't Gimple, like it says on my W-4.

58
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,094
It's Tunt.
ARCHER: Tum again?

59
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,861
Oh c'mon, nothing?
MALORY: Not the Tunts.

60
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,241
LANA: Wait, how do
I know that name?

61
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:21,777
CHERYL/CAROL: Ever
been on a railroad?

62
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,621
ARCHER: Yes.
LANA: Ho-lee shit!

63
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,860
ARCHER: Not a big deal,
they're everywhere.

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,841
LANA: Yeah, and her
great-grandfather built 'em all!

65
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,499
ARCHER: Wait, what?

66
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:33,569
MALORY: Do you expect me to believe
you're a descendant of Cornelius Tunt?

67
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,364
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah all,
whatever, five Cornelia.

68
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,038
MALORY And George Washington Tunt,
CHERYL/CAROL: The Tuntmore House. Yes.

69
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,969
I spent like, every summer
there, listening to my creepy

70
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:44,590
great-grandmother bitch
about Abraham Lincoln.

71
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:48,131
Apparently slavery
was pretty awesome.

72
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,043
MALORY: Prove it.

73
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,001
ARCHER: What's to prove,
it's free labor.

74
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:51,874
MALORY: Not that! Ass!

75
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:53,843
Prove you're really a Tunt.

76
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:58,102
CHERYL/CAROL Umm, I have a picture...
MALORY: You're kidding.

77
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:00,187
ARCHER: Oh my god! That's you!

78
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,455
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes, it's me.

79
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:04,458
Do you guys... I'm kinda freaking
out, you mind if I glue up?

80
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,660
MALORY: It's your house.
ARCHER: This is your house!

81
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:10,231
LANA: And right next door, is that...
that's the Roosevelt mansion!

82
00:04:10,298 --> 00:04:11,905
CHERYL/CAROL Total shitbox,
they're weird.

83
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,259
- What the...?
- What the hell was that?

84
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,103
Ugh, my stupid ocelot.

85
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:18,472
ARCHER: I've never
seen an ocelot!

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,776
MALORY: Cheryl dear...
I don't know quite how to put this, but...

87
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:25,579
ARCHER: Holy shit! You guys!
Look at his little spots.

88
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,354
MALORY: How much are
you, ahem, worth?

89
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:31,751
CHERYL/CAROL: Well until Monday it was
liiike, I dunno, about fifty million?

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,087
LANA: Do what huh what?

91
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:34,455
ARCHER: Carol, what's his name?

92
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,057
CHERYL/CAROL: Babou!
- I love him.

93
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,065
But it should be Buyer's Remorse!

94
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,465
Stupid thing's sick all the time.

95
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:42,477
MALORY: What happened Monday?

96
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,398
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.
My parents were murdered.

97
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,933
MALORY: What?!

98
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,993
CHERYL/CAROL: I'm kidding!
They are dead, though.

99
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:52,206
The chauffeur had a stroke
and slammed into a tree.

100
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,008
Funeral's probably
just wrapping up.

101
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:54,942
MALORY: Why aren't you there?!

102
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,611
CHERYL/CAROL: Because you said if
I was late again you'd fire me!

103
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,947
MALORY: Not for your parents' funeral!
CHERYL/CAROL: Well!

104
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,582
I don't know all your rules...
LANA: Can I... jump in?

105
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,419
Just kinda curious, why
do you even work at ISIS?

106
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:06,253
CHERYL/CAROL: Why do you?

107
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,722
LANA: I... because I'm not
worth a billion dollars!

108
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,790
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, me neither.

109
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,226
I have to split it with
my stupid brother Cecil.

110
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:14,727
MALORY: And how much
will you be splitting?

111
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,798
CHERYL/CAROL: It actually
is a billion dollars.

112
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,201
LANA: I am...
literally wet with jealousy.

113
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,068
CHERYL/CAROL: Jealous of what?

114
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:24,038
Being scared of kidnappers
the rest of my life?!

115
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,407
It was bad enough when I was
only worth fifty million!

116
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:31,212
Now it's gonna be ten times worse and...
And oh my God, I'm such a chicken!

117
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,257
I told them Pam was me!

118
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,230
LANA: Wow.
MALORY: Lana shut up.

119
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,751
First of all, I'm sure Pam is fine...
PAM: Who taught ya how to punch?

120
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,873
Yer husband?

121
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,798
You better just [BLEEP] kill me.

122
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,500
MALORY: And second of all, no one
is going to kidnap you on my watch.

123
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:55,330
You may consider ISIS
your personal bodyguard.

124
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,443
For, you know...
a modest retainer.

125
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,126
LANA: Ah.
MALORY: Still shut up.

126
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,248
CHERYL/CAROL: But... oh my God,
what about Pam?!

127
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,266
ARCHER: I dunno about Pam...
And I know even less about ocelots.

128
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,349
But my gut tells me you gotta
get some tree branches or a

129
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:13,687
tire swing or something in there, because
he is desperate for stuff to play with.

130
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:14,455
What're we doing?

131
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,991
MALORY: We're taking Cheryl back
to ISIS and locking it down

132
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:20,161
until we catch those
dastardly kidnappers.

133
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:21,829
Because we're all she has now.

134
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:24,598
ARCHER: Okay, but on the way we gotta
stop at a toy store and at least get him

135
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,283
a stuffed animal.

136
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,628
Something.

137
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:31,916
It's like Meow-schwitz in there.

138
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,339
POPEYE: Hm-hmm.

139
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,783
CYRIL: Half a billion?!
With a B?!

140
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:48,896
LANA: Followed by an illion.

141
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:52,478
CYRIL: Well that little... she owes
me thirtyseven hundred dollars!

142
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:53,407
LANA: For what?

143
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,966
CYRIL: What, nothing,
what're we doing?

144
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:57,991
LANA: Locking down ISIS.

145
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,652
Because once the kidnappers realize
they've got the wrong idiot,

146
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:03,150
they'll probably come
back for the right one.

147
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:05,284
So here. All hands on deck.

148
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:06,518
Cool.

149
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:11,058
Safety's off, Barn.

150
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:14,129
Trust me, dear.
This vault is the safest place

151
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,395
in the entire building.

152
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,298
CHERYL/CAROL: But wait... how much are
you gonna charge for ISIS to protect me?

153
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,218
MALORY: Well that's
based on my expenses.

154
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:25,105
Plus an administrative fee, a small
contingency fee, few odds and ends...

155
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,707
CHERYL/CAROL: And you're
gonna get Pam back, right?

156
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:28,642
MALORY: Right after you
sign that contract.

157
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,778
CHERYL/CAROL: Okaaaaayno.
First get Pam back.

158
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,589
MALORY: Wh-? But...
CHERYL/CAROL: And bring me some stuff to do,

159
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,746
it's crazy stupid boring in here.

160
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,249
ARCHER: Well, now you
know how Babou feels.

161
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:40,805
CHERYL/CAROL: Crepuscular?

162
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,351
BRETT: God! Damn it, Cyril!

163
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,595
CYRIL: Sorry!

164
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:47,315
CYRIL: Aw, c'mon...
LANA: Barney.

165
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,705
MALORY: Well now this
is just a disaster.

166
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:52,236
BRETT: Yeah ya think?!

167
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,663
MALORY: Not you, Mr. Blood Mobile!

168
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:58,059
Cheryl is insisting we try to get
the kidnappers to release Pam!

169
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,444
LANA: Weren't you...
gonna do that anyway?

170
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,029
MALORY: If it came up!

171
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,114
And will somebody answer the
damn phone once in their life?!

172
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,658
ARCHER: Lookin your way, Brett.

173
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,458
BRETT: Hello?
ARCHER: Was that so hard?

174
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:13,820
BRETT: Yes? Yeah, one sec?
Kidnappers.

175
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,088
LANA: Wh-? Keep 'em on the line!

176
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,574
ARCHER: I'm lead negotiator!
LANA: No you're not!

177
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:20,894
MALORY: And you. Take Cheryl some...
crayons, or cheese or something.

178
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:26,258
BRETT: Unghh... I'm s-so... c-coold...
GILLETTE: Brett get off the phone!

179
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:28,201
BRETT: You got it?
ARCHER: Yes! Hang up!

180
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,859
How long do I need
to keep him on?

181
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:30,810
GILLETTE: Two minutes.
LANA: What?!

182
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,273
ARCHER: What happened
to thirty seconds?!

183
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:34,104
GILLETTE: Your mother's
budget priorities!

184
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,314
MALORY: No, this is
all one solid piece.

185
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:40,313
Brazilian rosewood, straight from
the heart of the Amazon jungle.

186
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,283
Guess how many pygmies
died cutting it down.

187
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,879
Hint, six.

188
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,308
ARCHER: Small price
to pay for beauty.

189
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,491
Hi, Sterling Archer,
lead negotiator.

190
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,826
And to whom might I be speaking?

191
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,245
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Your
worst nightmare.

192
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,530
ARCHER: Hi great, one sec?

193
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,131
LANA: What are you doing?!

194
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:02,702
ARCHER: I'll tell ya what I'm not doing,
is negotiating with a goddamn cyborg!

195
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,525
LANA: That's just a
voice modulator!

196
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,802
ARCHER: You don't think cyborgs
have that technology?!

197
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,325
I'm hanging up!
LANA: Hanging up?!

198
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,089
ARCHER: Lana, it's not
worth it, it's just Pam!

199
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,777
No, Archer, stop.

200
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,967
They're probably tracing us.

201
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,608
We don't want them coming here.

202
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,485
You idiots.

203
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,382
- This is Cheryl Tunt!
- That's what I've been trying to tell you

204
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:30,235
between this little girl's love taps.

205
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,984
Seriously, maybe see if your daddy
will give you a roll of nickels?

206
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,589
KIDNAPPER: First of all, how
are you still conscious?!

207
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,452
PAM: How do ya think
I paid for college?

208
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:44,773
PAM: Two sixty, two-eighty,
and jackson makes three.

209
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,277
And sorry about your homey.

210
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,700
Homeys.

211
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:52,592
KIDNAPPER BOSS: And second,
where is Cheryl Tunt?!

212
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:56,323
PAM: Well I just assume she's safe at
ISIS, laughing her skinny lying ass

213
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,119
off because she got me kidnapped.

214
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:04,931
CYRIL: This isn't funny Cheryl, I need
that thirty-seven hundred dollars back!

215
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,938
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, sorry.
That money's gone.

216
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:09,143
CYRIL: Wh-?
What do you mean it's gone?

217
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,608
CHERYL/CAROL: It's been an
extremely volatile year.

218
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,187
CYRIL: In the stock market?
CHERYL/CAROL: Sure.

219
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:24,818
CYRIL: Well, whatever, I borrowed it from
my IRA and if I don't pay it back...

220
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:26,253
CHERYL/CAROL: What're they
gonna do, kneecap you?!

221
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:30,072
CYRIL: Wh-? Not the IRA, my IRA!

222
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,692
And there are huge tax
implications for that!

223
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,967
CHERYL/CAROL: I don't
have it, dum-dum!

224
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:37,611
All my money's in like, a trust or whatever,
and I'd have to ask my gross brother!

225
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,473
CYRIL: So?!
CHERYL/CAROL: So he's gross.

226
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,401
CYRIL: Cheryl I need that money.

227
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,870
CHERYL/CAROL: I don't have it!
Now screw already.

228
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,939
I've got kidnappers
to worry about.

229
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,111
CYRIL: But...

230
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,721
LANA: Okay, here we go...
This is Agent Lana Kane.

231
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:55,477
And you are?

232
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,651
KIDNAPPER BOSS: About five
seconds away from shooting

233
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:00,453
your friend Pam in
her rock-like face.

234
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:04,023
LANA: Well, we obviously don't want you to...
ARCHER: Violate the First Law of Robotics.

235
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:08,528
LANA:... Shoot Pam, so what will it
take for you to release her unharmed?

236
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:09,586
KIDNAPPER BOSS: I'll trade you.

237
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,874
For Cheryl Tunt.

238
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:11,942
ARCHER: Tum again?

239
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:12,923
Still nothing?

240
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:17,469
MALORY: Nooo no no no no... First of all,
we don't even know if Pam is still alive...

241
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,940
PAM: Yeah,
I'm right here with the guy!

242
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,601
MALORY: And even if she were...
PAM: I am!

243
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:22,903
MALORY: That's a no-brainer!

244
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:26,166
I mean my God, Cheryl's
worth half a billion.

245
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,351
PAM: What?!

246
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,614
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Well?!
How much is this one worth?!

247
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,320
PAM: Oh, for... seriously?
MALORY: I'm thinking!

248
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,315
KIDNAPPER BOSS: You're stalling!

249
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,737
So you can trace the call!

250
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,820
GILLETTE: No you've
got tons of time.

251
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,596
MALORY: Oh shut up.

252
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:41,246
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Hey!
What's it gonna be?

253
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,212
- Malory!
- Alright, I can do...

254
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:47,966
5 thousand?

255
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,324
PAM: What?!
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Okay, we're done here.

256
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,905
PAM: No no wait wait
wait, don't hang...

257
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,799
LANA: Five thousand?
MALORY: For Pam?

258
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,965
GILLETTE: I bet you spent ten tis
that on your new conference table!

259
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,121
MALORY: I did not!

260
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,266
Unless you include the funeral
expenses for those pygmies.

261
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,885
And I bet that sneaky little
chief just dumped them all

262
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:07,787
into one medium-sized hole.

263
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,170
GILLETTE: Well I was able to trace
the call to a one-block radius,

264
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,309
so if you will excuse me,
I am going to rescue Pam.

265
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,413
ARCHER: No, I will do that.
LANA: No, I will.

266
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,645
GILLETTE: God damn it!
Let's just everybody go!

267
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:19,499
MALORY: No!

268
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,512
There's half a billion dollars worth
of Tunt sitting in that vault!

269
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,236
That's the critical mission here!

270
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:25,787
LANA: So who gets it?

271
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:31,121
MALORY: No heroics, you two.
It's just Pam.

272
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,677
PAM: I mean, I know it's hard to put
a dollar value on a human life,

273
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,135
but for shit's sake...
five grand?

274
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,553
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Yeah, so please
don't take this the wrong way,

275
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:40,814
but I am gonna kill you.

276
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,829
PAM: Aw c'mon, I haven't
seen your faces!

277
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,125
KIDNBPPER BOSS: There.
PAM: Damn.

278
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,135
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Now shut up.

279
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:50,538
KIDNAPPER 1: Hey so, I'm not totally on-board
with a full-frontal assault on ISIS.

280
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,474
KIDNAPPER 2: Yeah I'm
actually totally off-board.

281
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,830
- My eyes still hurt pretty bad.
- Too bad.

282
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,342
That's the only way
we're gonna get to Cheryl Tunt.

283
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,215
- I can get you guys in.
- Um...

284
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,835
- Seriously?
- Yeah, screw them.

285
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,181
Especially Cheryl.

286
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,347
Hope you kidnap a shit out of her.

287
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,275
Huh! Where the hell is she?

288
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:12,092
- You're gonna be in so much trouble...
- No...

289
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:15,831
Trouble is what the IRS will do to me
if I don't pay back that loan.

290
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:17,080
The IRS?

291
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,081
Jesus, how many Irish gangs are there?

292
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:26,586
MALORY: But she must still
be in the building!

293
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,493
All the blast doors are down!

294
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,529
LANA: Yeah, so... oh, dammit!

295
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,864
Archer and Ray had to
leave through the garage!

296
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,465
MALORY: But they're not dumb enough
to leave the door wide open!

297
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,208
Are they?

298
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:38,642
ARCHER: Yes!
GILLETTE: Why?!

299
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,984
ARCHER: Because you're just
wearing it to piss me off!

300
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:42,774
GILLETTE: Is it working?

301
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:45,303
ARCHER: Yes! So take it off!
We look totally gay!

302
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,744
GILLETTE: I am gay.
ARCHER: Well I'm not!

303
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,558
GILLETTE: Then why are you
wearing that turtleneck?

304
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:50,033
ARCHER: Take it off.

305
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,433
GILLETTE: You better put
that back in your purse.

306
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,455
ARCHER: Hang on, this is far from over.
Talk to me.

307
00:13:57,523 --> 00:14:00,518
Yeah, it's totally wide open.
What?

308
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:03,855
No, I'm not an idiot, Mother!
We're still here, in the garage!

309
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,831
Because Ray is being
a total bitch!

310
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,500
MALORY: Why do you care
what he's wearing?!

311
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:11,066
LANA: Oh my God...
MALORY: I'm not taking his side!

312
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:13,714
LANA: Oh my God...
MALORY: Sterling, they've taken Cheryl!

313
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:17,842
Probably right past you two while you
were arguing over who's prettiest!

314
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,611
ARCHER: They didn't
come through here!

315
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,096
Kidnappers got Cheryl.
GILLETTE: Dukes!

316
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,867
ARCHER: But wait, they've still
gotta be in the building, right?

317
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,291
MALORY: Probably! So secure the perimeter,
do a floor-by-floor sweep, and...

318
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,588
Brett! For the love of God!

319
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,730
BRETT: Hello? Yeah one sec?

320
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,059
Kidnappers, line one.

321
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,481
MALORY: That's them.
Secure and sweep.

322
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:37,652
Idiots.

323
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:38,866
Lana, follow me.

324
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:42,267
ARCHER: Roger that.
I will definitely tell him.

325
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,208
GILLETTE: Tell me what?
ARCHER: She said for you take it off.

326
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:45,337
GILLETTE: No she didn't!

327
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,305
ARCHER: She absolutely
certainly did Ray.

328
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,507
And also for us to
sweep the building.

329
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,612
The doing of which
I am in charge.

330
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:55,412
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Hey, thanks
for getting us inside.

331
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:56,571
Somebody shoot her.

332
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:00,585
PAM: Oh, okay! Then good luck getting
past all the biometric scanners!

333
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:05,445
I mean, unless you wanna chop off my
fingertips and slice out my retinas!

334
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:09,857
Oh don't be dicks.

335
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:10,762
MALORY: What?

336
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,266
CYRIL: I said, I'll kill the Tunt
woman if you don't pay the ransom.

337
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,867
MALORY: I can't understand
a word of this.

338
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:18,882
LANA: Hey, Trainspotting.
Can you dial that modulator down a skoosh?

339
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,272
CYRIL: Is that better?

340
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:21,293
MALORY: Barely...

341
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,718
CYRIL: Hang on a second...
how about now.

342
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:24,494
MALORY: That's better.

343
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,592
Now I believe there was
some mention of a ransom?

344
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,920
CYRIL: Three thousand
seven hundred dollars.

345
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,085
MALORY: Wh-?
LANA: Wait, how much?!

346
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,160
A million dollars.

347
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,857
Fifty million dollars.

348
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,789
Why the hell are you down here?!

349
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:40,558
CHERYL/CAROL: Because
Cyril kidnapped me, duh!

350
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,838
GILLETTE: Oh you
are full of shit.

351
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,251
CYRIL: You heard me.
Fifty million dollars.

352
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:49,367
Unmarked bills, uh, non-sequential...
LANA: Just keep him on the line.

353
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,251
Something's very fishy
about this kidnapper.

354
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:54,851
CYRIL: Uh, let's see, what else...
MALORY: Tom Collins, try not to drown it.

355
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:59,112
CYRIL: Obviously a dye pack is a dealbreaker...
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Jesus, would you hurry up?

356
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:02,703
PAM: Hey! I'm not the one who
smashed my eyes into eggplants!

357
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:03,982
Nutsack.

358
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,986
PAM: There. Now cut this shit off
so I can do the fingerprint reader.

359
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,754
CYRIL: Let's see, what else?

360
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,928
LANA: Ahhhhh... ha!!
Who ya talkin to?

361
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:14,275
CYRIL: Nobody. Phone sex.
LANA: Really.

362
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,227
CYRIL: Yep! See?

363
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:19,206
Oh yeah, you like that, don't you?
MALORY: What?!

364
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:23,068
CYRIL: Your Daddy's dirty,
dirty little whore.

365
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:23,702
MALORY: What?!

366
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,441
CYRIL: Okay, I'm done masturbating.
Goodbye.

367
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:29,262
MALORY: What kind of sick,
degenerate...

368
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:37,437
My God, he was calling
from this floor!

369
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:39,818
Lana! Lanaaa!

370
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:40,585
LANA: Where is she?

371
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:42,854
CYRIL: Who knows, probably
some trailer park in Alabama.

372
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:46,530
LANA: Not the phone sex operator
you're totally lying about! Cheryl!

373
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,260
ARCHER: She's right here!
LANA: What?

374
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:50,028
CYRIL: What? I mean "See?"

375
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,864
GILLETTE: Yeah, little Miss Cry Wolf
here handcuffed herself to a radiator.

376
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:53,932
CHERYL/CAROL: What!

377
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,134
ARCHER: Which, even for
you, pretty pathetic.

378
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:58,403
CHERYL/CAROL: I didn't kidnap myself!
He did!

379
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,220
CYRIL: Who me?

380
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,488
No, I've been up here
the whole time.

381
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,391
Having some phone sex.

382
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,543
Just, jerking it.

383
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,077
On telephone...

384
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:09,538
Um, does the internet porn
know you're cheating on it?

385
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:10,898
- Very funny.
- Thank you.

386
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:13,088
Lana, Lana, the kidnapper!

387
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,416
- He was calling from this floor.
- Yeah.

388
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,099
And where the hell was she?

389
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,215
- Basement. - Kidnapped herself.
- No, I didn't.

390
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,395
- Oh, even for you...
- No, I didn't!

391
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,528
...is pathetic.

392
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:25,030
- ***, she's crazy.
- Yeah, crazy.

393
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,252
Just jacking it. On telephone.

394
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,272
*** ambushed, that's what I was doing.

395
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:31,942
- Wait, hang on.
- All the trouble you put us through.

396
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,521
Were there even any
kidnappers in the first place?

397
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:37,046
- Wh-Yes!
- Prove it!

398
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,933
They're right there, duh!

399
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:41,883
- That's not good.
- Drop your weapons.

400
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:44,049
Or she dies.

401
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,873
Oh, for... Seriously?

402
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,694
They're not gonna shoot you, Pam.
Their programming won't allow it.

403
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:51,854
- What?
- Don't ask.

404
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,278
- What?
- Plus if they do,

405
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:54,859
I'll shoot Carol.
CHERYL/CAROL: What?!

406
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:56,272
LANA: What the shit?!
ARCHER: Relax!

407
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,847
They can't risk killing Carol!

408
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,707
CYRIL: Although that would
actually be a win-win for me...

409
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:02,163
GILLETTE: Shut up.
And here, just in case.

410
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:04,285
- Oh, cool...
LANA: No no, don't give him a...

411
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:14,705
ARCHER: Shut up!
That vest is bulletproof!

412
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,329
CHERYL/CAROL: Oww!!

413
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:18,221
ARCHER: But it is,
ya know, a vest.

414
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,322
KIDNAPPER BOSS: Okay okay!

415
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,827
Don't shoot! I give up!
Totally give up.

416
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,041
LANA: Keep those hands up.
Pam? You okay?

417
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:32,263
PAM: Do you people
even give a shit?!

418
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,932
EVERYBODY: Whoa!

419
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:36,835
PAM: Cheryl's dumb ass gets me
kidnapped and the shit kicked

420
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:39,971
outta me all day, and nobody
even tries to rescue me...

421
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,039
GILLETTE: Archer's fault.

422
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,558
ARCHER: Shut up.
PAM: You shut up!

423
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,593
Mr. Pam's Not Worth It!

424
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:50,114
And then you stupid a-holes shoot a
jillion stupid a-hole bullets at me!

425
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,283
MALORY: Not me!
I wasn't shooting!

426
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,520
PAM: And you!
The worst of the bunch.

427
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,034
MALORY: Me? ! Why me?!

428
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,091
PAM: Five thousand
measly dollars.

429
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,327
MALORY: I, you know, maybe
I low-balled him at first,

430
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:03,795
but I had some wiggle room!

431
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:08,366
PAM: Yeah? Well, let's see how much you
wiggle when I'm whippin five thousand

432
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:10,187
bucks' worth of yer ass.

433
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,028
MALORY: What?!
LANA: Hey, whoa! Pam!

434
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,281
ARCHER: Lana.
Let her have this one.

435
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,233
MALORY: Sterling!
Somebody?

436
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:17,609
Anybody?!

437
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,355
PAM: Yeah, anybody?

438
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,004
Wanna piece of this?

439
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:28,981
Nope.

440
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:33,288
