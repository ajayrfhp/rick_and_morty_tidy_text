1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,168
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,169
(screaming)

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,971
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it, Ray.

4
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,106
Are you drunk?

5
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,107
>> RAY: No, dumbass, are you?

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,108
>> ARCHER: No.

7
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,175
>> LANA: Although not for lack

8
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,176
of trying.

9
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,177
>> ARCHER: Exactly, that's my

10
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,178
whole point.

11
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,213
(retching)

12
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,814
>> CYRIL: Oh, how can you drink

13
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,149
rum with all this turbulence?

14
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,150
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God!

15
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,651
That's my whole point!

16
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:20,652
>> MALORY: Enough already!

17
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,621
My God, are you people paid by

18
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,789
the word?

19
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,024
It's bad enough I'm packed into

20
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,058
this flying boxcar with you...

21
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,793
(gasping)

22
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,061
...without all this incessant

23
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,229
bickering.

24
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,663
It's like I'm stuck on a school

25
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,198
bus with the worst driver on the

26
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,234
planet!

27
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,235
(Ray muttering)

28
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,503
What was that?

29
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,504
>> ARCHER: It is kind of like a

30
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,571
school bus.

31
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,839
>> LANA: When have you ever been

32
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,874
on a bus?

33
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:42,875
>> ARCHER: No, from the movies.

34
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:43,876
We've got the whole Breakfast

35
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:44,910
Club in here.

36
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,245
I'm Emilio Estevez.

37
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,079
Cyril's obviously Anthony

38
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,680
Michael Nerd.

39
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,882
Mother, you're Paul Gleason.

40
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,250
Krieger's the loose cannon,

41
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,019
Judd Nelson, and Lana, you're...

42
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,020
um...

43
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,221
>> LANA: Wait, seriously?

44
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,023
Molly Ringwald.

45
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,591
>> ALL: Eh...

46
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,592
>> LANA: Oh, my God.

47
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,593
>> MALORY: What the hell are you

48
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,594
talking about?

49
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,730
Lana, come on, if any of you

50
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:05,831
ISIS women is Molly Ringwald...

51
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,032
>> CYRIL: It's obviously

52
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:07,866
Cherlene.

53
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:08,867
>> KRIEGER: Totally.

54
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,835
>> LANA: What?

55
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:10,836
>> ARCHER: Yes, she's the rich

56
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:11,837
one, she's a redhead...

57
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,905
>> LANA: So, what, you think I'm

58
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,206
Ally Sheedy?

59
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,207
>> MALORY: Are you all just

60
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,542
saying random words?

61
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,743
>> CYRIL: Ally Sheedy would've

62
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,044
been way more likely to get

63
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,045
pregnant in high school.

64
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,046
>> KRIEGER: Had there been a

65
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,047
sequel.

66
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:22,915
>> ARCHER: God forbid.

67
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,749
>> KRIEGER: Right?

68
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,750
>> CYRIL: And as for who's the

69
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,751
hot one...

70
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,186
>> LANA: Wait, what, of us?

71
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,220
I'm the hot one!

72
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,621
>> ALL: Eh...

73
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,689
>> LANA: Oh, my God.

74
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,690
>> CHERLENE: Oh, get over

75
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,691
yourself!

76
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,625
(muttering)

77
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,693
>> PAM: Shh! Will you shut up?

78
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:35,694
>> CHERLENE: Oh, please.

79
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,628
She knows we're in here.

80
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,229
>> PAM: She will if you

81
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,097
don't shut up.

82
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,098
>> MALORY (sighs): Pam, I know

83
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,566
you're in there.

84
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,201
>> PAM: No, we're not.

85
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,269
But if we are, which I don't

86
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,237
admit to, which Breakfast

87
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,072
Clubber am I?

88
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,307
>> ARCHER: Hmm, I guess the

89
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,708
janitor everybody thinks is

90
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,110
gross but turns out to be cool.

91
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,945
>> PAM: Aw.

92
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,079
>> CHERLENE (laughs): I love

93
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,280
that you take that as a

94
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,648
compliment.

95
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,717
(farts)

96
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,925
>> PAM: So, can we get out of

97
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:40,926
the crate now?

98
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,194
>> MALORY: No, but as it seems

99
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,163
we've arrived at a pause in the

100
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,131
idiocy, let's recap the plan for

101
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,366
when we land in San Marcos.

102
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,700
>> LANA: Yeah, because I'm

103
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,935
curious how we tell Calderón we

104
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,170
turned six million dollars'

105
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,304
worth of cocaine into one

106
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,805
million dollars' worth of

107
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,806
weapons.

108
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,807
>> MALORY: That's the CIA's

109
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:56,842
problem.

110
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,843
Calderón doesn't care.

111
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,011
It's all gravy to him.

112
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,145
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

113
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,213
I was actually wondering that

114
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,214
myself.

115
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,315
>> MALORY: All that matters is

116
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,816
that Calderón pays us for this

117
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,151
shipment.

118
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,319
Then we use the profits to buy

119
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,054
more weapons, which we sell to

120
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,956
him to make more profits to buy

121
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,157
more weapons.

122
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,358
Blah, blah, blah.

123
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,326
>> CYRIL (scoffs): Lana, for

124
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,861
God's sakes, it's Econ 101.

125
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,362
>> MALORY: Cyril, don't be

126
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,363
shitty.

127
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,364
>> ARCHER: Yeah, Cyril!

128
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,365
>> AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: Tower

129
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,800
to unidentified aircraft, you

130
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,001
are now entering restricted San

131
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,303
Marcos airspace.

132
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,804
Identify yourself.

133
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,072
>> RAY: Uh, guys?

134
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,173
>> ARCHER: Just tell them Slater

135
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,174
sent us.

136
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,175
>> LANA: You think that's a good

137
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,176
idea, flying into a war zone,

138
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,344
telling them we're with the CIA?

139
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,379
>> ARCHER: If Slater even was

140
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,380
CIA.

141
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,381
>> MALORY: Now, he's the one who

142
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,683
teabagged you?

143
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,684
(Pam growls suggestively)

144
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,685
>> ARCHER (scoffs): Beanbagged.

145
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,686
>> MALORY: Oh, whichever.

146
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,687
>> ARCHER: It's a fairly

147
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,688
important distinction.

148
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,889
>> LANA: Sorry, can I be a nag

149
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,890
for a second?

150
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,891
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God, Lana,

151
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,025
I've had only, like, eight

152
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,026
drinks.

153
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,194
>> LANA: Okay, not that,

154
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,195
but wait, really?

155
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,230
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I've totally

156
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,397
cut back, and not that it's any

157
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,032
of your beeswax, but I've also

158
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,367
cut back on... you know.

159
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,902
>> MALORY: On what?

160
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,071
Sterling, with you, that could

161
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,239
almost literally be anything.

162
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,406
>> ARCHER: Anonymous sex, if you

163
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,407
must know.

164
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,408
>> MALORY: Ew!

165
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,409
>> AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:

166
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,377
Beechcraft, please identify.

167
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,411
>> RAY: Guys?

168
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,246
>> LANA: Really?

169
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,113
>> ARCHER: I've totally,

170
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,414
relatively cleaned up my act.

171
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,782
So maybe keep that in mind when

172
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:11,783
you're choosing godparents.

173
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,418
(Lana laughs)

174
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,787
>> LANA: I will, Archer.

175
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,788
I really will.

176
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,422
>> AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:

177
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,257
Beechcraft, identify.

178
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,358
>> RAY: Guys!

179
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,259
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it, tell him

180
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,093
Slater sent us.

181
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,027
>> LANA: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

182
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,861
>> RAY: Tower, this is

183
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,428
Beechcraft.

184
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,263
>> LANA: Ray!

185
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,098
>> RAY: Uh, Slater sent us?

186
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,099
(groans)

187
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,133
>> AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:

188
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,268
Beechcraft, you are clear for

189
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,469
landing.

190
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,403
>> LANA: Thank you for hearing

191
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,404
my concerns.

192
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,739
>> ARCHER: Jesus, will you

193
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,873
relax?

194
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,742
(gulping)

195
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,809
(belches)

196
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,877
(groans)

197
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,145
(sighs) What's the worst that

198
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,480
could happen?

199
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,481
(tires squealing)

200
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,482
>> TROOPS: Get on the ground!

201
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,316
(indistinct shouting)

202
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,317
>> ARCHER: Don't shoot!

203
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,418
Don't shoot!

204
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,753
(shouting continues)

205
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:48,820
>> LANA: Way to go, Gilligan.

206
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,888
(gunshot)

207
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,323
>> CALDERÓN: <i>Silencio!</i>

208
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,425
Who is in charge here?

209
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,426
>> COMANDANTE: Señor Presidente,

210
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,460
I...

211
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,461
>> CALDERÓN: Not you, you

212
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,829
baboon-faced baboon.

213
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,930
I am obviously talking to these

214
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,465
gringos, and also, if I am here,

215
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,967
then you are obviously not in

216
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,068
charge.

217
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,069
>> COMANDANTE: I...

218
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,304
(gunshots)

219
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,440
(gun clicking)

220
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,841
(gunshot)

221
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:10,942
>> CALDERÓN: And to repeat,

222
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,312
who is in charge here?

223
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,413
>> ARCHER: That would be...

224
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,414
>> CALDERÓN: Because they are to

225
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,481
blame for this shipment of

226
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,449
weapons being late.

227
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,784
>> ARCHER: Her, that older woman

228
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,485
down there with the more or less

229
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,920
permanent scowl.

230
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,955
>> MALORY: Señor Presidente, it

231
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,457
is such an honor to meet you.

232
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,526
I'm Malory Archer.

233
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,927
>> CALDERÓN: Wow.

234
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,329
>> MALORY (chuckles): Well,

235
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,330
thank you.

236
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,532
Anyhoo, hello?

237
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,500
>> CALDERÓN: So, the stories are

238
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,135
true.

239
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,170
>> KRIEGER: What stories?

240
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,338
I... no, not what, huh?

241
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,339
Damn it, man, I was

242
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,340
sleepwalking.

243
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,341
>> CALDERÓN: Eh?

244
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,342
(muttering in agreement)

245
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,876
>> KRIEGER: Hey, what's

246
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,944
going on?

247
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:46,945
>> CYRIL (sighs): Maybe you're

248
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:47,946
their god.

249
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,847
(gasps)

250
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,514
>> CALDERÓN: Okay, all but him,

251
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,882
arrest.

252
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,017
(indistinct talking)

253
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,118
>> MALORY: Without even checking

254
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,453
the merchandise?

255
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,555
(snapping)

256
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,389
(groaning)

257
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,490
Although not that particular

258
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,958
merchandise.

259
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,126
(Pam and Cherlene shouting)

260
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,361
(guns clicking)

261
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,395
(speaking Spanish)

262
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,496
(shouting)

263
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,565
(gunshots)

264
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,336
>> CHERLENE: Goddamn it!

265
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,405
Who the hell drilled my box?!

266
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,539
>> ARCHER: So, we're just done

267
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,841
with phrasing, right?

268
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,908
That's not a thing anymore?

269
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,909
(gasps)

270
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,910
I know, right?

271
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:19,911
>> CALDERÓN: Cherlene.

272
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,912
>> CHERLENE: What?!

273
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:21,913
>> ALL: Wait, what?!

274
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:22,914
>> ARCHER: Yeah,

275
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,815
seriously, what?

276
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:24,516
>> CALDERÓN: "Outlaw Country,"

277
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,151
"Hoochie Coochie Coochie Man,"

278
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,386
"Travis County Limitado."

279
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,187
I am... I am your biggest fan.

280
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,489
Please, we go to the

281
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,390
presidential palace?

282
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,858
>> PAM: I'm fine, too,

283
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,859
by the way.

284
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,559
>> ARCHER: Oh, great.

285
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,394
>> LANA: That's good.

286
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,395
>> CALDERÓN: Please, come, come.

287
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,562
Come, come, come, come, come.

288
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,563
>> ARCHER: So, phrasing's just

289
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,498
dead then?

290
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,499
>> LANA: What is your...?

291
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,566
Wait, are you drunk?

292
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,601
>> ARCHER (scoffs): Please.

293
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,402
Off 12 drinks?

294
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,403
>> CALDERÓN: Viva Cherlene!

295
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,937
Viva Cherlene!

296
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:46,938
>> TROOPS (chanting): Cherlene!

297
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,039
Cherlene!

298
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,207
>> LANA: Wait a minute, you said

299
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,575
eight drinks!

300
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,410
(chuckles)

301
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,944
>> ARCHER: I lied.

302
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,279
I mean, yes, eight.

303
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,915
>> TROOPS: Cherlene! Cherlene!

304
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,690
>> PAM (laughing): Holy

305
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,193
dickballs!

306
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,528
I mean, I mean, I mean, just

307
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,529
holy....

308
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,530
>> LANA: Dickballs.

309
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,531
Yes, Pam, I got it.

310
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,598
>> CALDERÓN: Are you sure?

311
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,599
The room is okay?

312
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,600
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, it's fine,

313
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,601
whatever.

314
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,602
>> CALDERÓN: I-I cannot believe

315
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,603
it is actually you.

316
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,238
Here in my palace, I mean...

317
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,239
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, it's blowing

318
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,240
your mind, huh?

319
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,241
>> CALDERÓN: Boom!

320
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,242
(laughing): Yeah.

321
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,244
Can I please bring you anything?

322
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,412
A freshly squeezed juice, a

323
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,447
cocktail, a sandwich of your own

324
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,448
choosing?

325
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,449
>> CHERLENE: Don't you, like,

326
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,450
have a war to go to?

327
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,451
(scoffs)

328
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,452
>> CALDERÓN: It's in the

329
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,719
mountains far, far away where we

330
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,488
will crush the communist rebel

331
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,622
dogs!

332
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,824
Especially now that we are once

333
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,625
again receiving weapons.

334
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,893
>> MALORY: Yoo-hoo!

335
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,495
And about that, I was hoping

336
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,330
that you and I could discuss

337
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,465
our terms?

338
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,433
>> CALDERÓN: I... but Cherlene?

339
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,601
>> MALORY: Is exhausted.

340
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,504
As is my drink.

341
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,605
(sighs)

342
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,606
>> CYRIL: Why do we always have

343
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,740

00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,679

00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,684
But I kind of don't mind it.

00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,056
yes.

515
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,057
>> ARCHER: All right, is

516
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,726
that happy hour I smell?

517
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,893
>> CALDERÓN: Yes, Mr. Archer.

518
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,061
Please join us.

519
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,062
Your mother and I are drinking

520
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,063
wine that belonged to Benjamin

521
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,598
Franklin.

522
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,599
>> MALORY: We are?

523
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,600
>> CALDERÓN: And discussing a

524
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,001
shipment of four American tanks.

525
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,903
>> MALORY: Oh, tanks!

526
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,171
>> ARCHER: Thanks. Tanks?

527
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,172
>> MALORY: We do tanks!

528
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,173
We can do anything, as long as

529
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,742
you're willing to pay.

530
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,943
>> CALDERÓN: Me... me pay?

531
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:25,944
>> MALORY: Good, then it's

532
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:26,945
settled.

533
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:27,946
>> ARCHER: If you say so,

534
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:28,947
Mother.

535
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,748
>> CALDERÓN: No, no, no, I'm

536
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,749
sorry, I-I thought this was why

537
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,883
the CIA was buying my cocaine.

538
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,018
To sell to the American black

539
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,553
people, to make the money to buy

540
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,588
the weapons to give me to fight

541
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,889
the    <i>comunistas.</i>

542
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:38,923
>> MALORY: Exactly.

543
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,924
>> ARCHER: Wait, what?

544
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,925
Why wouldn't they just...?

545
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,926
>> MALORY: Sterling, shut up

546
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,927
and let me handle this.

547
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,129
Because the problem, Gustavo...

548
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,130
>> CALDERÓN: Ooh.

549
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,197
>> MALORY: I'm sorry, may I call

550
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,198
you Gustavo?

551
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,199
>> CALDERÓN: No.

552
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,934
>> MALORY: The problem, Señor

553
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,870
Presidente, the problem, you

554
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,539
see, the problem is...

555
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,940
is the White House has lost

556
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,975
faith in your ability to win

557
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,543
this war!

558
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,544
>> CALDERÓN: Ooh.

559
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,545
>> MALORY: And so, if you want

560
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,546
any more weapons, you'll have to

561
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,547
pay for them in cash.

562
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,548
>> CALDERÓN: Ooh!

563
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,549
>> MALORY: Starting now.

564
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,550
>> CALDERÓN: No, no, but I

565
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,551
cannot afford to do this!

566
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,585
>> MALORY: Oh, please.

567
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,787
Look at you, drinking Ben

568
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,821
Franklin's wine like it's

569
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,789
Kool-Aid, surrounded by

570
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,590
priceless art...

571
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,592
Not this one obviously, but...

572
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,627
>> CALDERÓN: Oh, no, this one

573
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,628
cost 40 millions.

574
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,796
>> MALORY AND ARCHER: What?!

575
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,830
>> CALDERÓN: Yes, it is an Ivan

576
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,831
Blitko.

577
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,965
So we have, in this area, these

578
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,801
very geometric shapes, in these

579
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,569
very bold colors here, and then

580
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,004
the thick black lines are coming

581
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,605
here, always drawing the eye to

582
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,840
here, and then, over

583
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,642
everything... just white.

584
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,843
Just layer after layer after

585
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,178
layer of pure white.

586
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,612
Until you can see nothing of the

587
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,848
painting below.

588
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,616
Not even with an infrared

589
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,617
camera.

590
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,985
>> MALORY: So... what's the

591
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,021
point?

592
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,189
>> CALDERÓN: The point?

593
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,190
What is the point of a beautiful

594
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,825
woman?

595
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,693
And speaking of!

596
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,961
>> JULIANA (chuckles): Hello,

597
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,863
darling.

598
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,264
>> CALDERÓN: My wife.

599
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,567
(Archer grunting)

600
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,971
(gulps)

601
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,840
(burps)

602
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,512
>> MALORY: Sterling!

603
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,880
Where are your manners?

604
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,014
>> ARCHER: Probably in my room,

605
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,015
so I should go there right now

606
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,983
and find them.

607
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,884
>> CALDERÓN: No, no, no, no,

608
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:13,952
no, please stay.

609
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:14,853
 <i>Mi amor,</i> may I present to you

610
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,821
Sterling Archer, and also his

611
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,623
charming mother Malory.

612
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,024
>> JULIANA: Juliana Calderón.

613
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,859
>> MALORY: A pleasure to meet

614
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,860
you, Juliana.

615
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:22,861
>> JULIANA: Oh.

616
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,895
>> MALORY: I'm sorry, may I call

617
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:24,829
you...

618
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,630
>> JULIANA: No.

619
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,631
>> CALDERÓN: Uh, darling, how

620
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,665
was your afternoon?

621
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,000
>> JULIANA: Exhausting.

622
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,869
>> ARCHER: Mmm.

623
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,871
>> JULIANA: So hot and sweaty.

624
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:33,905
>> ARCHER: Mmm.

625
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,006
>> JULIANA: To be honest, I'm

626
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,474
really quite sore.

627
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,408
>> ARCHER: Mm-mmm!

628
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,043
This is why I disapprove.

629
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,044
Juliana sometimes goes among the

630
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,713
servants, pretending to be a

631
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,881
maid, or working in the laundry,

632
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,015
even one time helping to carry

633
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,483
some rocks?

634
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,718
>> MALORY: Oh, how...

635
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,886
>> JULIANA: Inspiring, really.

636
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,887
>> MALORY: Mmm.

637
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,888
>> CALDERÓN: I was just showing

638
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,922
them the Blitko.

639
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:51,923
>> JULIANA: Do you like what you

640
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,858
see, Mr. Archer?

641
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,993
>> ARCHER: You know, so much

642
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,694
that... I-I'm gonna go write

643
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,063
about it in my art journal!

644
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,065
>> CALDERÓN: She is going to

645
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,501
bring us some tanks, so that we

646
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,870
may crush the rebel dogs.

647
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,071
Did they tell you what is for

648
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,439
dinner?

649
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,440
>> CYRIL: Clones?

650
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,675
>> KRIEGER: Yes, clones!

651
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,043
My God, it was like looking

652
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,745
in... several mirrors!

653
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,079
>> PAM: Oh, man, oh, man, oh,

654
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:15,914
man, oh, man...

655
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,915
>> KRIEGER: Archer!

656
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,950
>> ARCHER: What?!

657
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,085
>> KRIEGER: Ow, ah, hang on...

658
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,120
gotta stitch... oh...

659
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,054
>> ARCHER: Damn it, I don't have

660
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,589
time for... wait, Pam, did you

661
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,890
find an ice machine?

662
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,025
>> PAM: Huh-uh.

663
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,927
Ow, hang on... (groans)

664
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,761
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it...

665
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,695
>> PAM: Clones!

666
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,529
>> ARCHER: What?

667
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,463
>> CYRIL: Krieger says-- ow,

668
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,464
hold on...

669
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,365
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it!

670
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,066
>> CYRIL: Krieger says he saw a

671
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,401
bunch of clones!

672
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,402
>> ARCHER: Of what?

673
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,137
We're running to find them.

674
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,138
>> PAM: Wait, what?

675
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,139
I thought we were running away

676
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,073
from them!

677
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,408
>> ARCHER: Hang on, shut up,

678
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,909
hold that thought.

679
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,778
>> KRIEGER: Guys, come on, let's

680
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,779
go!

681
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,713
>> PAM: Not without a bunch of

682
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,914
garlic and some wooden stakes.

683
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,950
They're clones, not vampires!

684
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,084
>> PAM: It doesn't matter to

685
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:53,952
the stake!

686
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,153
>> KRIEGER: What're you... we

687
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,154
can't kill them!

688
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:56,955
>> PAM: Well, not now.

689
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:57,956
We wait till morning and then

690
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,957
murder them in their coffins.

691
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,958
Cyril?

692
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,959
Thoughts?

693
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,960
>> CYRIL: I just really wish I

694
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,428
hadn't come on this stupid trip.

695
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,631
But since I did...

696
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,099
>> KRIEGER: Taaaaanks!

697
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,969
You jerks.

698
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,037
(muffled scream)

699
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,941
(muffled scream)

700
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:17,942
(Lana sighs)

701
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:18,843
>> LANA: Don't even want to

702
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:19,844
know.

703
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,012
>> ARCHER: Lana!

704
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,013
Lana!

705
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,147
Oh, my God, you gotta help me!

706
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,115
>> LANA: Oh, for the... there is

707
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,750
no ice machine!

708
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,751
>> ARCHER: Okay, not that, but

709
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:27,752
A) a palace this big

710
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,120
definitely has an ice machine,

711
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,121
maybe not in the hall, but it's

712
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,589
not like they make ice with

713
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,590
trays.

714
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,524
B)...

715
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,359
>> LANA: "B" is hey, shut up,

716
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,994
about that thing where you said

717
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,462
you're cleaning up your act.

718
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,596
>> ARCHER: Which I'm actually

719
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,664
pretty serious about, by the

720
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,132
way, but right now I want to

721
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,667
talk about this other thing

722
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,768
where I just banged Calderón's

723
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,871
wife.

724
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,872
Lana?

725
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,474
>> LANA: Uh, hang on.

726
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,775
Okay.

727
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,010
(clears throat)

728
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,178
Why would you do that?!

729
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,780
>> ARCHER: I... I'm sorry, do

730
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,048
you mean where?

731
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,683
>> LANA: No, Archer, I mean why!

732
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,784
What happened to no more

733
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,885
anonymous sex?

734
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:01,886
>> ARCHER: It wasn't anonymous,

735
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:02,887
Lana.

736
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,888
I thought she was the maid.

737
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,889
>> LANA: Why would you think

738
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,124
that?!

739
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,125
>> ARCHER: I'm sorry, do you

740
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,226
mean why?

741
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,627
>> LANA: Wh... Yes!

742
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,628
Why?!

743
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,030
>> ARCHER: Uniform, towels, the

744
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,197
usual maid stuff!

745
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,232
>> LANA: The... whoa-whoa-whoa-

746
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,233
whoa, back up.

747
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,167
What is your definition of

748
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,502
anonymous sex?

749
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,503
>> ARCHER: I don't know,

750
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,504
bird masks?

751
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,238
>> LANA: What?

752
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,005
>> ARCHER: Or a woman you

753
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:21,806
literally bump into on the

754
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:22,807
train.

755
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,641
Or the ferry.

756
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,009
Or in a port-a-john at the

757
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,044
Preakness that time, but not

758
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,211
somebody who works directly for

759
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,212
a president, I can tell you

760
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,213
that.

761
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,214
I mean, we're talking major

762
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,582
security clearance, so you got

763
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,184
to assume there's a pretty

764
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,020
thorough vetting process for...

765
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,022
that... you know...

766
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,190
>> LANA: You done?

767
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,825
>> ARCHER: Hang on.

768
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,826
Yes?

769
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,061
>> LANA: Okay. So.

770
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,529
Here's my advice.

771
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,598
(grunts, moans)

772
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,535
Do with it as you will.

773
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,237
(Archer moans, coughs)

774
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,874
(groaning)

775
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,276
>> CHERLENE: Hey, are you going

776
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,244
to this dinner?

777
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,212
(retches)

778
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,915
Or did you already eat...

779
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,050
crayons?

780
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,051
>> JULIANA: Should we not just

781
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,086
start?

782
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,087
(clears throat)

783
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,088
>> CALDERÓN: Not until the guest

784
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,089
of honor arrives.

785
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,290
>> CHERLENE: Woooooo-hoo!

786
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,124
(Calderón gasps)

787
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,125
>> CALDERÓN: Yes, yes, yes, yes,

788
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:14,959
yes, yes, come, come, come,

789
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,893
come, come, come, because I am

790
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,861
pulling out!

791
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,862
>> CHERLENE: Phrasing, boom!

792
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,097
>> ARCHER: Thank you.

793
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,231
(moans)

794
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,232
>> LANA: How's the balls?

795
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,266
>> ARCHER: Ruined?

796
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,101
I'm pretty sure?

797
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,968
>> CALDERÓN: Okay, you sit

798
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,969
there.

799
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:25,736
Uh... you.

800
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,737
Up.

801
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,638
>> MALORY: I beg your pardon?

802
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,706
>> CALDERÓN: Get up.

803
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,074
Come on, move it, up, up, up!

804
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,275
>> MALORY: Well, of all the...

805
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,276
>> CALDERÓN: Please, Cherlene.

806
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,244
Everyone, raise a glass, and

807
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,114
join me to toast Cherlene!

808
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,648
Because-- and I happen to know

809
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,283
this for a fact-- her debut

810
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,085
album has now officially sold

811
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,287
one million copies!

812
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,288
(Malory shrieks)

813
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,289
(others cheering)

814
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:45,957
>> CYRIL: Yay!

815
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,657
>> CHERLENE: How?

816
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,758
It came out, like, yesterday.

817
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,659
>> CALDERÓN: Yes!

818
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,727
Amazing!

819
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,595
A toast.

820
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,262
>> CHERLENE: No, like literally

821
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,296
yesterday.

822
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,664
>> CALDERÓN: And now it is

823
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,265
platinum.

824
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,266
A toast!

825
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,267
>> CHERLENE: I just don't see

826
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,935
how it's possible.

827
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,905
(forklift beeping)

828
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:04,675
(many forklifts beeping)

829
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,676
>> CALDERÓN: It doesn't matter

830
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,677
how!

831
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,912
A toast!

832
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:08,679
>> PAM: Hear, hear!

833
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,947
(murmurs of agreement)

834
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:10,982
>> CALDERÓN: And also let us not

835
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,284
forget my brave soldiers, yes,

836
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,785
out there, fighting those rebel

837
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,155
dogs, far away!

838
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,156
>> PAM: And plus that one right

839
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,157
there.

840
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,992
>> COMANDANTE: Señor Presidente!

841
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,993
The rebels have broken through

842
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:22,994
our lines!

843
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,062
They...

844
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,133
They are now within mortar

845
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,134
range!

846
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,170
(screaming)

847
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,171
>> CHERLENE: Oh, my God!

848
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,172
It's starting!

849
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,173
>> MALORY: What is?

850
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,175
>> CHERLENE: Cherlenemania!

851
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,342
>> LANA: It's a mortar attack!

852
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,144
>> CHERLENE: I know!

853
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,145
How frickin' outlaw country

854
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,282
is that?!

855
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,350
¶ I'll burn it down

856
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,186
I'll burn it down to the ground

857
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,288
¶ I'll burn it down

858
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,190
To the sea...

859
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,992
¶ I'll burn it down

860
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,327
Down to the ground

861
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,229
¶ You don't mess with

862
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,865
This country queen

863
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:05,169
¶ Don't you mess...

864
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,171
With this country queen. ¶
