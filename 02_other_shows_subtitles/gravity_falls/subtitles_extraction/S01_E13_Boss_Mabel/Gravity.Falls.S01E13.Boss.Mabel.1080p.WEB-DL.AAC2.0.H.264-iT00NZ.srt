1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,150
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,460
We now return to cash wheel...

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,190
sponsored by chipackerz.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,830
The chip-flavored crackers!

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,220
They taste just like chips!

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,380
Congratulations! You're taking a...

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
Cash shower!

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,080
I like that guy's style.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,460
Mr. Pines! We got tourists at nine o'clock!

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,910
A whole busload of 'em!

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,130
Hot tamales! It's a jackpot!

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,990
Soos, make some new attractions!

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,240
You got it, boss.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,670
Wendy, mark up those prices! The higher, the better!

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,060
Higher! Bleed 'em dry!

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,570
Sheesh, grunkle Stan,

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,060
It's like when you look at tourists

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,760
All you see are wallets with legs.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,170
That's not true.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,440
Thanks for taking me to the mystery shack, daddy.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,600
Ha ha! Now, don't spend yourself all in one place.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm feeling car sick.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,190
Clean-up on the front lawn!

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,420
Ladies and gentletourists,

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,260
Looking around my mystery shack,

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,800
you'll see many wondrous roadside attractions.

27
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,350
Be amazed at the only known photo

28
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,820
of a horse riding another horse.

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,420
That's--that's pretty good.

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,580
Ooh! Wow!

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,070
Be astounded by the horrible pre-teen wolf boy!

32
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,870
Oh, look at him! All that hair!

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,790
His body is changing! Aaah!

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Grunkle Stan, this is demeaning.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,900
What?! I don't know "Da meaning" of that word.

36
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,440
If you throw money at him he dances.

37
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,160
Ow! Hey!

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,990
Ha ha ha! Ooh! Ha ha! Thank you!

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,080
Behold! Mystery shack bumper stickers!

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,110
You can stick 'em on your bumper or...

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,150
Over your husband's mouth.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,620
Am I right, ladies?

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,390
She knows what I'm talkin' about.

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,770
You are bad. How much?

45
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,370
Hey, it's on the house.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,090
That's the Mabel difference.

47
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,240
- Thanks for visiting! 
- What?!

48
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,520
What the heck do you think you're doing?

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,820
Business! Ching, ching, ching!

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,640
Listen, kid, you don't make money by giving stuff away.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,650
- You're off of register duty!  
- But--but--

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,500
No "Buts" except yours out the door!

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,410
Now shut your yap and get to work!

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,940
Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to "Please" And "Thank you"?

55
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,770
Hmm? Oh, wait.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
Here they are!

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,570
"Please" Never made me any money, kid.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,330
In fact, just saying the word

59
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,320
is giving me a burning sensation.

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,880
Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume?

61
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,240
I think I'm getting hookworm.

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,680
Ha ha! Yep, gluing dog hair to your body will do that.

63
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,190
You have all these dumb fake exhibits in the shack.

64
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,310
Meanwhile, I've seen

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,310
actual amazing things in the forest every day.

66
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,390
What if you hunted down a real attraction

67
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,200
instead of lying to people for a living?

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,230
And you should be nicer to your employees, too.

69
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,290
Yeah!

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,480
Look, you guys got a problem with how I run the shack,

71
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,230
Take it up with the complaints department.

72
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,070
Zing! Ha ha ha!

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,110
I am going to write them such a letter!

74
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,910
And don't stop till you've covered that sign with glitter!

75
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,300
Glittery signs attract tourists! Also large birds.

76
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,610
Ha ha! That's funny.

77
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,570
Okay, is it just me, or is

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,630
having grunkle Stan as a boss seriously the worst?

79
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,170
I know, right? Why do we even put up with it?

80
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,430
I tried to give him a suggestion to improve the shack once.

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,640
I had this idea where I could be,

82
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,880
like, the mystery shack mascot--

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,340
"Questiony the question mark."

84
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,390
I ask people questions,

85
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,360
You know, do the question dance...

86
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,940
That sounds amazing!

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,080
- Oh, cool! 
- Yeah, totally!

88
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,270
Yeah, well, Stan said I couldn't handle it.

89
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,570
He said what?!

90
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,100
And remember, folks,

91
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,680
We put the "Fun" In "No refunds"!

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,000
Ha ha! Suckers.

93
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,590
You!

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,640
Grunkle Stan, you've gone too far this time!

95
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,880
Did you seriously tell Soos not to follow his hopes and dreams

96
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,790
because he "Couldn't handle it"?

97
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,930
Look, kid, let me break it down for you.

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,180
Being a boss is about commanding respect.

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,230
If you give people everything they ask for,

100
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,380
they'll walk all over ya.

101
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,210
No way! I bet you'd make way more money being nice

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,130
than being a big, grumpy grump to everyone all the time.

103
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,550
Ha! You think you know more about business than I do?

104
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,160
You think you could wear this hat?

105
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,580
Yeah, because I give people respect.

106
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,880
And glittery stickers.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,360
Ha! I'd make more money on

108
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,450
vacation than you would running this place!

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,330
Then why don't you go on vacation?

110
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,470
Interesting. All right, I'm a wagering man.

111
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,220
Three days. 72 hours.

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,940
You run the shack, and I'll go on vacation.

113
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,440
If you make more money than me,

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,960
I guess it means you're right about the way I run my business.

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,910
But if you lose,

116
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,830
You gotta wear this "Loser" Shirt all summer. Ha ha!

117
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,150
Fine! But if I win, I get

118
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,340
to be the boss for the rest of the summer!

119
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,630
Plus, you have to sing an

120
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,100
apologizing song with lyrics by me, Mabel.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,520
Oh ho! You got yourself a deal, missy!

122
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,790
No, you got yourself a deal!

123
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,560
- Deal! Deal!
- Deal! Deal!

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,780
Deal.

125
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,330
See you in 72 hours! Ha ha!

126
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,150
We'll see who makes more money.

127
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,130
Mabel, did you just make a bet with a professional con man?

128
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,180
Oh, come on. Being a better boss than Stan will be a cinch.

129
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,190
Profits, here we come!

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,830
- You broke the jar. 
- We'll get a new one.

131
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,510
I guess I shouldn't be too worried.

132
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,240
I mean, how much money could Stan even make on vacation?

133
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,120
Can I help you, sir?

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm here to take all the cash from your wheel.

135
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,810
You wanted to see us, mr. Pines?

136
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,210
Stan is no longer with us.

137
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,640
He's dead?! No! It should have been me!

138
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,670
Whoa, Soos. Stan's not dead.

139
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,650
He's on vacation for three days.

140
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,580
We made a bet.

141
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,450
Thank you for that clarification.

142
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,070
Mabel's in charge now!

143
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,030
Are those shoulder pads?

144
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,580
Uh-huh!

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,320
It's just one of the many up-to-date managerial tricks

146
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,850
I learned from this book I found propping up the kitchen table.

147
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,700
Why does your mug say "NO.2"?

148
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,730
Because the real NO.1 is you.

149
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,320
- Yeah, I get it. 
- Morale!

150
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,190
Walk with me.

151
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,670
With me as boss, you're gonna notice a few changes around here.

152
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,760
My job is to help you be your best "Selves."

153
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,360
Satisfied.

154
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,110
Everyday.

155
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,920
Loving life.

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,730
Very much.

157
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,420
Everyday.

158
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,340
Satisfied.

159
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,250
Great listening here so far!

160
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
Waddles, hold my calls.

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,320
All right, people, now rap with me.

162
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,090
Wendy, how can I make your workspace more Wendy-friendly?

163
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,270
Hmm. Well, Stan never lets me hang out with friends at work.

164
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,350
Stan ain't here, sister! Door's open!

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,180
Sweet!

166
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,140
And Soos,I believe this is yours.

167
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,200
Questiony the question mark?

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,150
I wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited I am.

169
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,720
As for you, Dipper...

170
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100
Die, wolf costume, die!

171
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,580
I want you to head into those woods and don't come back

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,510
until you've found an amazing attraction!

173
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,730
Finally! Time to show Stan how a real mystery hunter does it!

174
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,510
Dipper out!

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Okay, guys, it's time to prove that nice bosses finish first.

176
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,040
In the next 48 hours, we're gonna fill up this jar

177
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,550
with six hundred billion dollars!

178
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,530
Yeah! Yeah!

179
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,120
Wait. Do you know how money works?

180
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,580
Of course. Waddles, run down to the shop and grab me a latte.

181
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,080
He's a hungry little guy.

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,980
Ahh. This line is taking forever.

183
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,070
Time to use my old man powers.

184
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,980
Aaah! I'm having a heart attack!

185
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,960
And the only cure is to be a contestant on--

186
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,410
On cash wheel!

187
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,750
Oh! Someone give me a part! I'm old.

188
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,650
Should we escort him off the lot?

189
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,050
That man is a self-centered attention hog

190
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,870
with no regard for human decency.

191
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,780
Get him on tv!

192
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,160
Whoa, yeah, come on girl

193
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Shoulder pads

194
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,870
Make that money

195
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,070
Mabel's the boss now

196
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,440
Walk in, girl

197
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,240
Show them boys

198
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,930
- Make that money...  
- Time cards.

199
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,260
Time cards.

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,620
Time cards.

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,610
Boss, boss, boss, boss, boss!

202
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,430
It's beautiful!

203
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,230
Wow, this is some freak show you got.

204
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,410
Thank you! See you soon!

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
Tell 'em Mabel sent you!

206
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,330
Mabel, I captured something!

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,700
This is gonna blow those tourists away!

208
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,010
Marvelous work, valued employee.

209
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh! Who's that?

210
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,360
Is it questiony the question mark?

211
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,190
Ah, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this, Mabel.

212
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,440
I keep forgetting my lines,

213
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,140
and this costume is more, uh, revealing than I expected.

214
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,690
Soos, don't give up.

215
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,850
Anything is possible when you...

216
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,930
"Imaginize it."

217
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,630
But I don't know what that means.

218
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,150
Shh!

219
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,320
Shh...

220
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,960
Believe in yourself.

221
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,080
But--but I--

222
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,770
Oh, so--so cold.

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,270
How's my favorite wendy?

224
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,720
Yeah. Okay, all right. No. Look out. Look out.

225
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,010
Yeah! Keep it goin'!

226
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,110
Oh, what's this?

227
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,540
Billy!

228
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,730
Your face! It's ruined!

229
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,090
I'm so sorry. Please, have a refund.

230
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,780
Wendy, you've got a lot of cleaning up to do.

231
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,570
Please?

232
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,180
Whoa. All this rule stuff

233
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,070
is starting to make you sound like Stan.

234
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,720
What?! No, I'm nothing like Stan!

235
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,750
In fact, take the rest of the day off.

236
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,780
- With full pay?  - Of course.

237
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,940
Mabel Pines, you are the best boss ever.

238
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,510
I'm questiony the question mark! Aaah!

239
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,140
Aaah! Oh, don't! It stings so bad!

240
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,460
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to...

241
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,920
Cash wheel!

242
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,820
Now let's meet those contestants.

243
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm Doug, from Fairfield, California.

244
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,050
I'm Donna, from--

245
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm Stan! Stan Pines! Ha ha!

246
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,770
Did we--did we already do me? Hello? I'm Stan!

247
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,640
Heh heh. Okay.

248
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,710
Well, it's gonna be a long night, folks.

249
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,490
It's time to solve--

250
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,320
It's, uh, time to solve that puzzle.

251
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,790
- Carla.  
- Yes, Rich?

252
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,000
Are there any "S's"?

253
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,640
Actually, it's not your turn yet--

254
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm ready to solve!

255
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,390
No. The game hasn't started.

256
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,060
Is it "Shut your yaps"?

257
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,660
Well played.

258
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,950
Cash shower, cash shower, cash shower...

259
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,890
Cash shower!

260
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes! Da da doo.

261
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,910
Mr. Pines. No, you don't need to take your clothes off--

262
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,450
No--go to commercial. Go to commercial!

263
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,790
Ladies and gentlemen--

264
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,330
My name's honest Dipper, and, unlike my cheating uncle,

265
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,620
I have something to show you that isn't a hoax.

266
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,770
It nearly killed me getting him into that cage.

267
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,360
Behold! Part gremlin, part goblin--

268
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,800
The gremloblin!

269
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,650
Well, that's fun.

270
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,220
It's fake, honey. You can see the strings.

271
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,630
What?! Those aren't strings! That's body hair!

272
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,110
Ah, look at this, dear.

273
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,830
The six-pack-o-lope.

274
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,310
Ha ha! Wordplay!

275
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,770
No! Everything else here is fake!

276
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,210
This is a real paranormal beast.

277
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey! Fun fact about this little guy:

278
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,150
You look into his eyes, you can see your worst nightmare.

279
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,380
Amazing, right? I work for tips.

280
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,010
Thanks again for visiting!

281
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,120
Thanks for shopping with us.

282
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,890
I'll get that!

283
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,570
Here ya go.

284
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,660
Sorry! Have refunds! That's the Mabel difference!

285
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,580
Well, I just made two people go insane.

286
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,000
- How about you?
- I'm so tired.

287
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,850
I gave wendy the day off, so I had to do her job.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,910
Well, maybe you need to

289
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,560
start being a little bit tougher around here.

290
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,570
No way! That's what Stan would do!

291
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,100
I just need to think positive, be friendly,

292
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,740
and everything will work out fine.

293
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,390
What? How did he get out of his locked cage?!

294
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,010
Well...

295
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,880
You gave him a break?!

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,350
He's an employee! Sort of.

297
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,050
We gotta round him up. Where's Soos?

298
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,170
He was stressed out,

299
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,330
so I told him to take a soothing nature walk.

300
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,850
Hello? Civilization?

301
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,820
Doggy?

302
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,240
Ladies and gentlemen, Stan Pines is poised

303
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,650
to become our grand champion!

304
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,400
Anything to say to your fans out there?

305
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,420
See you tomorrow night, Mabel!

306
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,500
What do we do?!

307
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,520
He's awarding himself stickers that he didn't even earn!

308
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,790
Uh, got it. "When fighting a gremloblin, use water...

309
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,340
"...only as a last resort,

310
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,510
as water will make him much, much scarier."

311
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,450
Aah! Who writes sentences like that?!

312
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,510
Don't worry. He's gotta leave eventually.

313
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,610
I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin'.

314
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin'.

315
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,110
I'm the singin' salmon spendin' all day jammin'.

316
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,540
Ohh! Why doesn't he just leave?

317
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,590
- Our profits!
- Mabel, wait!

318
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,100
Stop! Stop!

319
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,380
Don't look into his evil eye!

320
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,940
You'll see your worst nightmare!

321
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,750
I wish we had an evil eye to show him!

322
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,590
Oh, no! Aahh....

323
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
Wait. Hey, monster!

324
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,240
Take a look at this!

325
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,170
Well, at least he didn't do that much damage.

326
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Oh, boy.

327
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,880
Dipper, it's the third day.

328
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,190
We've only got seven hours to earn back our profits

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,800
Or I've gotta wear that "Loser" Shirt all summer!

330
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,480
Hey, guys. Am I nuts,

331
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,880
or does this place look different?

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,580
Wendy! Soos! Am I glad to see you.

333
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,820
We've got a lot of work to do, but if we hurry,

334
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,600
We can still beat Stan!

335
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,880
Uh, yeah. I got a little headache,

336
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,150
So maybe I should, like, not work today.

337
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,150
And I actually just met this pack of wolves,

338
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,730
And I think they're gonna, like,

339
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,790
raise me as one of their own?

340
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,370
So I should really be at the den right now.

341
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,040
But--but--

342
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,910
But, hey, we'll see you on monday.

343
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,450
Uh, is anyone gonna eat these?

344
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,770
Enough!!!

345
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,330
I have had it!

346
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I fought a monster to save this business,

347
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,310
And this is how you repay me?!

348
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm gonna get an ulcer from your lollygagging!

349
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,790
- Lollygagging?
- Ulcer?

350
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,670
You're acting... different.

351
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,910
You shut your yaps!

352
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,250
I've been doing everyone's jobs

353
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,450
while you've both been bleeding me dry!

354
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
- But-- 
- No "Buts" except yours on the floor, cleaning!

355
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,340
- Now quit loafing and get to work!
- Yes, Mabel.

356
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,360
That's "Yes, boss."

357
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,260
Dipper! What have I become?

358
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,360
What you had to, Mabel... what you had to.

359
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,340
We've got seven hours to turn this around!

360
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,840
Let's go, people!

361
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,820
You landed on "Cash flood"!

362
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,260
Ha ha ha ha!

363
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm givin' none of this to charity!

364
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,810
And now you can go home a thousandaire...

365
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,080
Or you could risk everything to double your money

366
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,560
with the bonus word!

367
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
Rich, I'm a simple man.

368
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,020
So I'm gonna take my winnings, pack my bags, and...

369
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,480
Bet them all on the bonus word!

370
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,540
Come on!

371
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,110
Time is money, hardhats!

372
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,200
You got complaints, file 'em with the complaint department!

373
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Ohh! My back!

374
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,380
Dipper! We got tourists at nine o'clock!

375
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,190
What do I show them? Real magic just freaks people out.

376
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,160
Figure something out, knucklehead!

377
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,290
Ladies and gentletourists,

378
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,700
This shack is filled with

379
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,120
wonders never before seen by human eyes!

380
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,710
The horrible giant question baby!

381
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,360
Am I a man? Am I a baby?

382
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,130
These are legitimate questions.

383
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,240
Have your picture taken with it for a buck.

384
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,480
Uh, ten bucks. A hundred bucks!

385
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,190
We put the fun in "No refunds."

386
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,370
- How'd we do?
- We filled the whole jar!

387
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,270
Minus the money to replace all the furniture

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,610
And supplies to fix the shack, that leaves us..

389
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,020
One dollar.

390
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,870
- Tick-tock! Time's up, kids!
- Oh, no!

391
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,430
Nice to see you learned how to dress while I was gone.

392
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,040
How much did you beat us by?

393
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,140
I won $300,000!

394
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,700
And then...

395
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,610
For a chance to double your cash or lose it all,

396
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,080
What is a six-letter word you use to ask for something politely?

397
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,260
For example, "May I blank have that?"

398
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,900
Do I look like an idiot, folks?

399
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,460
The word is "gimmee." twe E's.

400
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,830
Oooh! You know, because you've gone this far,

401
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,650
We're gonna give you one more chance.

402
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,980
Let's try again. It's a "P" Word.

403
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,790
Some might even say it's the "Magic word."

404
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,050
Abracadabra! Final answer!

405
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,850
I'm sorry, Stan, but the word is...

406
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,600
"Please."

407
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,760
Apparently that word can make you money.

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,190
So, wait. If you lost everything,

409
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,360
Then that means-- Mabel! You won!

410
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,020
Whoo! We did it!

411
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,070
Wait. What do we win again?

412
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,990
Well, according to our bet,

413
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,400
I guess Mabel's the new boss?

414
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,480
- No! No! Don't do that!
- Huh? What?

415
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,390
Grunkle Stan, I had no idea how hard it was being boss.

416
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,260
This place was cuckoo bananas

417
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,530
until I started barking orders at people like you.

418
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,810
Yeah, well, I got to admit,

419
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,050
It's kind of nice to be back, ya know?

420
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
Okay, okay, that's enough, get offa me!

421
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,910
And Soos, Wendy...

422
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,660
Get to work!

423
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,900
Ahem. Please. Uhh! Still hurts.

424
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,640
Mabel, didn't your agreement say something about

425
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,770
Stan having to do some kind of apology dance if he lost?

426
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,200
N-no. No, it didn't.

427
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,250
Actually, yeah, I think I have it in my notes here.

428
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,670
No! That never happened!

429
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,090
Ha ha! I'll get the camera!

430
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,450
All right, let me just--

431
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,170
Grunkle Stan!

432
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,170
Uhh. Look, I'm not gonna--

433
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:10,670
Do it!

434
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm Stan, and I was wrong

435
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,040
I'm singing "The Stan wrong song"

436
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,230
I shouldn't have taken that chance

437
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,960
Now here's my remorseful dance

438
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,480
Do the kicks!

439
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,160
Jazzier!

440
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,970
Hey, gimme that!

441
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,330
Ow! My back!

442
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,450
What do you think?

443
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,600
Take thirty!
