1
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,894
Volim da kupujem
božićne stvari ranije.

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,789
Dali imate nešto što
je u duhu sezone?

3
00:00:09,304 --> 00:00:11,305
Šta kažeš na ove kristale?

4
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:14,649
Izgledaju kao komadići stakla.
-Šta si ti? Pandur?

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,266
Šta je ona nova stvar?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,417
Ujače Stene.
-Možemo da odemo do restorana?

7
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:21,701
Gladni smo.

8
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,601
Gladni.

9
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,774
Da, naravno. Sve dok ovaj
prostak ne promeni mišljenje.

10
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,976
Imate ovo sa drugom životinjom?

11
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,681
Slažem se sa time da ga
zaključam ako ste i vi.

12
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:40,714
Puma majca...Panter majca?

13
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:43,339
Puma majca...Panter majca?

14
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,449
Puma majca....

15
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,609
Panter majca?

16
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,924
GRAVITI FALS

17
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,524
Marš.

18
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,071
Kafa. Kafa. Kafa.

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,046
Napred. Napred.
Napred. Napred.

20
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:53,454
Lazy Susan! There's my little
ray of sunshine!

21
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,028
Where we<i>you</i> yesterday?

22
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,449
Ha ha ha ha!
Hilarious!

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,117
Thank you.

24
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,107
You do split plates, right?

25
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:07,142
<i>Maybe.</i>

26
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,212
Great! We'll all split
one-fourth of the number seven,

27
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:13,114
plus a free salad dressing
for the lady

28
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,949
and a small plate of ketchup
for the boy.

29
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,786
But Grunkle Stan,
I want pancakes.

30
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,821
With the fancy flour
they use these days?

31
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:22,099
What am I, made of money?

32
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:31,088
Don't worry, guys.
Pancakes are on me.

33
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:34,047
I'm gonna win some by beating
that manliness tester.

34
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,916
Manliness tester?
Beating?

35
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,082
He says... he says he's...

36
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:45,313
What? What's so funny?

37
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:50,218
No offense, Dipper,
but you're not exactly
manly mannington.

38
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:54,538
Hey! I am <i>too</i> manly... Manny,

39
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,004
or whatever it is you said.

40
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,806
Look, face the music, kid.

41
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,109
You got no muscles,
you smell like baby wipes,

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,646
and let's not forget
last Tuesday's... Incident.

43
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:04,981
♪ Disco girl ♪

44
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,496
♪ Comin' through ♪

45
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:09,498
♪ That girl is you ♪

46
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,316
Don't come in!
Don't come in!

47
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:15,187
You were listening
to girly Icelandic
pop sensation babba?

48
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:18,123
No, I wasn't.
It's not important!

49
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:20,537
Look, come on, guys,
I'm plenty masculine!

50
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:21,805
You see this chest hair?

51
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:25,488
Put it away! Put it away!
So smooth! My eyes!

52
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,156
Oh, man.

53
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,233
Fine, family of little faith.

54
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,235
Get ready to eat your words...

55
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,303
<i>And</i> a plate
of delicious pancakes.

56
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,518
All right, Dipper.

57
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,588
Time to manhandle this...
Man handle.

58
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,974
And a-one, and a-two...

59
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,643
Quit stallin'!

60
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,610


61
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,032
Oh, what?!
This thing must be broken.

62
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,435
It's totally broken, guys.
It's like a million years old.

63
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:16,238
Probably ran out of steam power
or...

64
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,260
it's rickety, man.
You shouldn't even...

65
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,525
yes! Pancakes for everyone!

66
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,349
I need to get
some chest hair,
and fast.

67
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:38,602
I'm fine! Heh heh.

68
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,403
Everything's fine.

69
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:43,372
Sheesh! How am I
related to <i>that?</i>

70
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,910
Come on, Grunkle Stan.

71
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,946
I'm sure deep down
you have a soft side too.

72
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:52,345
Ha! Nothing in here
but a cold, dark,
empty soul.

73
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,740
Food!

74
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,908
Thanks there, sugar pie.

75
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,944
I mean, honey wasp kitten baby.

76
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:58,979
Ba-baby cow...

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,948
ha ha! Silly!

78
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,484
Silly man.
What was <i>that</i> about?

79
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:04,819
Nothing. I, uh, don't
want to talk about it.

80
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,788
Talk about what?
Why is this table wet?

81
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,523
Wait just a second.

82
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:11,392
I think I have
an idea happening here.

83
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,628
You... And her...
No! Stop it!

84
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,464
Aaah!
Oh, boy.

85
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,566
You have a thing
for lazy Susan!

86
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,535
You <i>do</i> have a soft side!

87
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,471
But k-k-keep it down,
will ya?

88
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:24,541
I admit it, okay?
It would be nice
if she liked me.

89
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,511
But I've been out of the game
for so long I wouldn't know
where to start.

90
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:30,147
I mean, look at her.
She's so classy.

91
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,416
Spin, ya dumb pie! Spin!

92
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,218
Grunkle Stan,

93
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:37,354
you are a cranky, gross,
weird old man.

94
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,356
But we will get lazy Susan
to like you,

95
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:42,059
because nothing is stronger
than the power of...

96
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,261
Love?
Mabel.

97
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,063
To victory!

98
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:50,607
Not manly enough.

99
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:53,410
Stupid diner!
Stupid lumberjack!

100
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,010
No!

101
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:58,212
Another hydrant destroyed.

102
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,114
It's a gosh-dang mystery!

103
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,750
Wanna take off our uniforms
and run around in circles?

104
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,719
Quit readin' my mind.

105
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,386
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
looking for the mailman.

106
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:15,189
Oh. What? Are you saying
I'm <i>not</i> a male man?

107
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,224
Is that what
you're trying to say?

108
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,459
I'm not male?
I'm not a man?

109
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,428
Is that what you're getting at?

110
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,363
Are you crying?

111
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,099
Two...

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,002
Three...

113
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:31,869
Four...

114
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,358
Uhh!

115
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,327
No chest hair yet.

116
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:44,335
Is it physical?
Is it mental?
What's the secret?

117
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,074
You said it, brother.
I need help.

118
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,183
For the love of
all that's holy, run!!!!

119
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,129
Wait. Sorry.

120
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:37,871
Please don't eat me!
I haven't showered
in like a week!

121
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:41,208
And I'm...
I'm like all elbows!
Elbows and gristle!

122
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,143
You!!!
Aaah!

123
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,845
Gonna finish that?

124
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:46,471
No.

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,475
I can't believe it.
Part animal, part human.

126
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,277
Are you some kind of minotaur?

127
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,145
I'm a manotaur!

128
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,247
Half man, half, uh...

129
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,449
Half taur!

130
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:59,584
So did I, like,
summon you, or...

131
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:02,253
The smell of jerky summoned me!

132
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,321
Jerky!

133
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:12,063
Huh.

134
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,134
I smell...

135
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,304
emotional issues.

136
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:23,074
I got problems, manotaur.
Man-related problems.

137
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:27,278
Well, my own uncle
called me a wimp,

138
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:29,214
uh-huh. Uh-huh.
And I kinda flunked

139
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,183
this manliness
video game thing...
Hmm...

140
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:34,252
Hey! You know,
you seem pretty manly.

141
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,321
Maybe you could
give me some pointers?

142
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:38,423
Hmm. Very well.

143
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:41,226
Climb atop my back hair, child.

144
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,161
Uh, okay.

145
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:46,264
Yes! Yes!

146
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:50,301
Ooh! Uhhh!

147
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,569
Dude, watch out!

148
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,244
Whoa.

149
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:05,283
This place is amazing!

150
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,452
The gnomes live in the trees,

151
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,488
the Mer-people
live in the water...
'cause they're losers!...

152
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:15,059
but we manotaurs
crash in the man cave!

153
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:19,130
Beasts! I have brought you...

154
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,533
A hairless child!

155
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,101
- 'Sup?
- Huh?

156
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:27,238
This is, uh, pubitaur,
testosteraur, pituitaur,

157
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:28,540
and I'm chutzpaur.

158
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,376
And you are...
My name's Dipper.

159
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,478
Weak!

160
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:36,281
The, uh, destructor?

161
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:39,117
Yeah, that's better.
An improvement, yeah.

162
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,554
Dipper the destructor
wants us to teach him

163
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:45,156
the secrets to our manliness!

164
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,293
I need your help.
Look at this, guys...
look at this!

165
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:51,429
I must confer with
the high council.

166
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,731
So, teach him our man secrets,
or what?

167
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,868
He's a human.
I don't like him.

168
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:58,804
I don't like your face!

169
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:04,409
I like these guys.
Aaah!

170
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,847
Okay, Grunkle Stan.

171
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:12,784
Welcome to the first day
of whatever is left
of your life!

172
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,653
First a "before" picture.

173
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:15,821
Aaah!

174
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,658
I never miss
a scrapbook-ortunity.

175
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,760
♪ Deedley-dum, mem-ories ♪

176
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:22,828
Bleet!

177
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,696
Let's start out
with some role-playing.

178
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:26,532
Soos will play lazy Susan.

179
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,433
I'm soft like a woman.

180
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,802
Grunkle Stan, show me
how you approach a woman.

181
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:34,540
Remember this is a safe,
non-judgmental environment.

182
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:37,643
I'll just be right off
to the side judging you
on a scale from one to ten.

183
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:44,850
Can I borrow some money?

184
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,553
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

185
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:49,454
After a lot of punching,

186
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:53,525
we have decided to deny
your request to learn
our manly secrets.

187
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,793
Denied!

188
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,795
Denied!

189
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,731
Okay, fine.
That's okay with me.

190
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,568
Obviously you guys think
it would be too hard
to train me.

191
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:05,370
Maybe you're not <i>man</i> enough
to try.

192
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,438
Huh?!!!

193
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,283
Not <i>man</i> enough?!

194
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,651
Destructor...

195
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,519
Not man enough?!!!

196
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:12,687
He didn't mean it.

197
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,391
I have three y chromosomes,
six Adam's apples,

198
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,328
pecs on my abs,
and fists for nipples!

199
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:23,465
Seems to me you're <i>scared</i>
<i>to teach me how to be a man.</i>

200
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,701
Hey, do you guys hear that?
It sounds like...

201
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,337
Oh, that's weird.

202
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,640
Is that... that sounds like...
yeah, a bunch of chickens!

203
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:36,511
I feel all weird.

204
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,481
He's using some
sort of brain magic!

205
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,350
After a second round
of deliberation,

206
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,752
we have decided to help you
become a man!

207
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,422
Man! Man! Man! Man!

208
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,590
Great! Thanks, guys.

209
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,326
Whatever it is,
I will not let you down.

210
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,797
Being a man is about
conquering your fears.

211
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:58,333
For your first man task,

212
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:02,637
you must plunge your fist
into the pain hole!

213
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,405
The what?

214
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,575
Pain hole, schmain ho...

215
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,444
whaaaa!
Aaaaaah!

216
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,645
Aaaahhh!!!!

217
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,584
Are you sure this is
really necessary?

218
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,520
You wanna be a man, don't you?

219
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:22,423
- Man! Man! Man!
- Man! Man! Man!

220
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:31,599
All right. Let's try to get that
inner beauty on t<i>outside.</i>

221
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,734
Smile harder.

222
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,371
Harder!

223
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,405
Perfect.

224
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,440
Soos!
What's up, hambone?

225
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:40,675
What do you think?

226
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,646
Aaaaaah!

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,416
Ohh. This is going to take some
really great training music.

228
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,395
Aaah!

229
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,631
Who wants to rub this
on my back?

230
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:39,734
Guys, I just want to say that
these last few hours have been...

231
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,503
I feel like there's
really been some growth.

232
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,505
<i>I</i> have a growth!

233
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,609
Glark, you are hilarious today!

234
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,678
It's just you guys
took me under your wing

235
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,448
and have just been
so supportive.
Oh, stop.

236
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,383
No, you know what?
You really have been.

237
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,418
I feel like I'm finally
becoming a man here.

238
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,354
Not yet, destructor.

239
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,722
One final task remains.

240
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,724
Hey, quit it!
<i>You</i> quit it!

241
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,326
The deadliest trial of all.

242
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,362
I've survived
forty-nine other trials.

243
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,696
Whatever it is, bring it on!

244
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,365
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

245
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:23,444
Behold our leader...
Leaderaur!

246
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,546
♪ Rum-ta-tum-tum
tum-ta-tum ♪

247

or wisest or...?

248
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,285
Greetings, young...

249
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,486
Aaaah!

Nah, he's just the offering.
That is leaderaur.

251
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,464
You! You wish to be man?

252
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:44,632
Arrrr!

253
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,302
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

254
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,570
Then you must do heroic act.

255
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,507
Go to highest mountain...

256
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,542
Aaaaah!

257
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,546
And bring back head of...

258
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,715
The multi-bear.

259
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:03,318
Ohh!
Ooh!

260
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,687
The multi-bear?
That some sort of bear?

261
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,522
He's our sworn enemy.

262
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,726
Conquer him and your
mansformation will be complete.

263
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,495
Conquer? I don't know, man.

264
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,465
Destructor!
Is this yours?

265
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,634
Uh, no. Ha ha! I...
I don't know whose that is.

266
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,303
I was just borrowing it.
It's a friend's. Not mine.

267
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,672
I don't know about this.

268
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,307
Uh...

269
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,414
I shall conquer the multi-bear!

270
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,684
Aah! Aah!

271
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,386
I'm okay.

272
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,042
I'm comin' for you,
multi-bear.

273
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,044
Okay, Grunkle Stan.

274
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,379
You started like this,

275
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,182
but y<i>became...</i>

276
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,217
Can I scratch myself now?

277
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,486
No! No, no, no!

278
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,455
Is that throw-up on your shirt?

279
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,491
I don't know
how to answer that.
Ohh!

280
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,160
Face it, Mabel,
your uncle's unfixable.

281
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,064
Like that spinning
pie trolley thing
in the diner.

282
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,200
Grunkle Stan, come with me!

283
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,135
And leave your pants at home.

284
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,104
With pleasure!

285
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:56,080
What a multi-bear?

286
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,417
O<i>that's</i> a multi-bear.

287
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,155
Bear heads...
silence!

288
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,392
Child, why have you come here?

289
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,195
Multi-bear,
I seek your head!

290
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,165
Er, one of them, anyway.
There's like, what, six?
Six heads?

291
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,368
This if foolish!
Leave now or die!

292
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,304
So be it.

293
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,055
Hahh!

294
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,237
A real man shows no mercy!

295
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,140
Ohh. Very well, warrior.

296
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,144
But will you Grant
a magical beast
one last request?

297
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,379
Uh, okay.

298
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,183
I wish to die listening
to my favorite song.

299
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,320
Tape is already in there.
You can just hit any...

300
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,422
Yeah, yeah, that's it

301
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,062
You listen to Icelandic
pop group babba?

302
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,297
I-I love babba.

303
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,432
I thought I was the only one.

304
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,334
All the manotaurs make fun of me

305
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,470
because I know all the words
to the so<i>disco girl.</i>

Finally, someone who...

Oh, yeah. I guess
I'm supposed to kill you

I'm not gonna do it!

317
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,439
You were told
the price of manhood
is the multi-bear's head!

318
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,107
Listen, leaderaur, all right?

whatever your name is.

321
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,046
Beardy?
It's beardy.

322
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,216
You keep telling me
that being a man means
doing all these tasks

323
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,118
and being aggro all the time,

324
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,387
but I'm starting to think
that stuff's malarkey.

325
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,057
You heard me. Malarkey!

326
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,460
So maybe I don't have muscles
or hair in certain places,

327
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,263
and sure, when a girly pop song
comes on the radio,

328
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,365
sometimes I leave it on,
'cause dang it,

329
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,301
top 40 hits are in the top 40
for a reason,

330
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,203
they're catchy!
Destructor!

331
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,471
What are you saying?

332
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,140
I'm saying the multi-bear
is a really nice guy.

333
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,376
And you're a bunch of jerks if
you want me to cut off his head!

334
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,416
Kill the multi-bear,
or never be a man!

335
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,319
Then I guess
I'll never be a man.

336
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,454
Boo!
Weak!

337
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,229
Hey, guys! Who wants
to go build something
and knock it down?

338
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,265
Man! Man! Man! Man!

339
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,168
Man! Man! Man!
Man! Man...

340
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,406
Spin! Spin!

341
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,410
Lazy Susan, listen.

342
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,178
I know he's not
much to look at,

343
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,546
but you're always
fixing stuff in the diner,

344
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,415
and if you like fixing stuff,

345
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,251
<i>nothing</i> could use more fixing
than my Grunkle Stan.

346
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,253
Also, women live
longer than men,

347
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,255
so your dating pool is smaller
and you should really
lower your standards.

348
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,325
So, lazy Susan, whaddya say?

349
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,463
Arggh.

350
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,165
Hey!

351
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,466
Here's my number.

352
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,369
Why don't you give me
a call sometime?

353
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,371
Really?
Really!

354
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,439
Ha ha!

355
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,108
Also, here's some pie.

356
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,144
On the house...
for <i>you!</i>

357
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,280
We did it!

358
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,116
When are you gonna call?
You want to call now?

359
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,584
I don't have a phone.
Let's buy a phone!

360
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:56,354
We can put it on a credit card!
Let's get a credit card.

361
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,123
Mabel! Let a man
enjoy his pie, huh?

362
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,194
Dipper!
It's me, Mabel!

363
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,129
I'm looking at you
through the glass!

364
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,064
Right here!
This is my voice!

365
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,067
I'm talking to you from inside!

366
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,169
Didja see me
through the...
yes.

367
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,371
What's wrong?

368
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,272
I don't want to
talk about it.
Good.

369
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,476
It's just these half-man,
half-bull humanoids
were hanging out with me...

370
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,478
Here we go.
But then they wanted me

371
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,480
to do this really tough,
horrible thing,

372
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,216
but it just wasn't right,
so I said no.

373
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,085
You were your own man
and you stood up for yourself.

374
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,155
Huh?
You did what was right even
though no one agreed with you.

375
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,458
Sounds pretty manly to me,
but what do I know?

376
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,495
Wait a minute!
Do my eyes deceive me?

377
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,097
You have a chest hair!

378
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,333
You're right! I do!

379
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,302
Ha ha! This is amazing,
I really do!

380
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,272
Take that, man tester!
Take that, pituitaur!

381
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,175
Pituitaur?
This guy has chest hair!

382
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,578
Scrapbook-ortunity!

383
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,449
Don't worry, kid.
If you're anything like me,

384
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,518
there's more where
that came from.

385
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,486
Ohh, gross!

386
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,458
Seriously, that's disgusting.

387
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,195
Oh, not again!

388
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,064
Message number thirty-six.

389
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,332
<i>Hey, handsome!</i>

390
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,235
It's me, lazy Susan,
calling to say hi!

391
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,273
<i>Hi! My cats also</i>
<i>wanted to say hi.</i>

392
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,241
<i>Say hi, Donald.</i>

393
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,444
<i>Meow.</i>
<i>Good. Sandy, you say hi.</i>

394
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,313
<i>Meow.</i>
<i>Mr. cat face,</i>
<i>now it's your turn to...</i>

395
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,348
<i>Mr. cat face!</i>

396
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,285
<i>- Anyway, call me!</i>
<i>- Call me back!</i>

397
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,220
How do I get out of this?!

398
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,859
