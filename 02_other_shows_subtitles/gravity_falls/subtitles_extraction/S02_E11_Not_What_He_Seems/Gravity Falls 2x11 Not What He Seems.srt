1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,953
Come on. Come on. Should be
just enough to finish the job.

2
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:14,839
Phew! Can't be too careful
with this stuff.

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,415
"Warning."

4
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,043
Blah blah blah...

5
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:29,362
"Extreme usage could result
in minor gravity anomalies."

6
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,239
Can it, Poindexter.
I've come this far.

7
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:32,999
I'm not giving up now.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,239
Yes, this is it!

9
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,554
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,
but it'll all be worth it.

10
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,912
Just eighteen more hours.

11
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:14,390
Finally, everything changes...

12
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,316
today.

13
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,478
Aah! It's here!
It's here! It's here!

14
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,800
Okay, so I was just
opening random doors, because I'm a creep,

15
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:44,078
when I found
something amazing!

16
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,431
If it was worth
waking up at 7:00 am for, that will be amazing.

17
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,475
Feast your eyes!

18
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,543
Whoa!

19
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,953
Bro. Bro.
We're both thinkin' it.

20
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,005
Crazy rooftop
fireworks party!

21
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,417
Not so fast, kids.

22
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:01,829
There is no way on earth
you're setting off those dangerous, illegal fireworks...

23
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,530
without me.

24
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,745
Here you go, sweetie!

25
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,340
Set something on fire for your
Grunkle Stan!

26
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,083
I am the god
of destruction!

27
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:18,479
Whoa!

28
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,808
Yay! Whoo!

29
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:22,842
Hold on a minute.
Do you have a permit for those?

30
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,186
Uh...

31
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:26,887
Uh, do you have a permit
for being totally lame?

32
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:29,657
Hey-o!

33
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,993
Well, I can't argue
with that.

34
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:33,460
Carry on.

35
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:36,338
Ha ha!

36
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:37,356
But seriously, though,
we should probably clean this mess up.

37
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,503
With water balloons?

38
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,029
I don't see why not.

39
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,541
Seriously?

40
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:49,185
Ow.
Whoo!

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,571
Ah, this is what
Saturdays are for.

42
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,156
Doing dumb things forever!

43
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,191
Dumb things forever!

44
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,335
Whoa, there!

45
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,502
To Grunkle Stan!

46
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:00,946
Not just a great uncle.

47
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,090
The greatest uncle!

48
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,610
Ha ha. All right,
all right. I tell ya,

49
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,230
it's unnatural for siblings to
get along as well as you do.

50
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,258
Ha ha! Don't worry,
we've still got plenty of summer left

51
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,918
to drive each other crazy.

52
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:19,332
Heh... yeah...
plenty of summer left.

53
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:23,252
Kids, there's something I, uh...
something I should tell you.

54
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,863
It's, um... W-well, it's
complicated.

55
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,090
I...

56
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,717
I'm gonna go refresh my soda.

57
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,487
Enjoy it while you can, Stan.

58
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:33,663
They'll find out
sooner or later.

59
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:37,466
Today's the day.

60
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,551
What is that, a ladybug?

61
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:41,987
What the...
Oh, no!

62
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,092
Target's secure.
Take the house.

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,086
What the...?

64
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,096
Kids are secure.

65
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,347
Roof team, go!

66
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,303
Clear!

67
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,196
Clear!

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,358
Pig secure, we
have secured a pig.

69
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,914
Hey, hands off, you stooge!

70
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,133
Aah! I don't understand!

71
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,452
What did I do that warrants
this much arresting?

72
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,389
The government guys?

73
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,133
I thought you
got eaten by zombies.

74
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,052
We survived... barely.

75
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,895
I used Trigger
as a human shield.

76
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,438
He cried like a baby.

77
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,865
Wha-hey!

78
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,076
Not in front
of the Special Ops guys.

79
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:31,620
This is security footage
of a government waste facility.

80
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:35,124
At 0400 hours last night,
someone robbed 300 gallons of dangerous waste.

81
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,859
What? You think
that's me?

82
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,211
Don't play dumb
with us, Pines!

83
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:41,313
<i>But I actually   am   dumb!
Last night I was restocking</i>

84
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,506
the gift shop...I swear!

85
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,217
Wait, Grunkle Stan!

86
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,962
You've got the wrong guy!
Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift the occasional tangerine,

87
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,450
but he's not
some evil supervillain.

88
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,968
Listen, kid.
We've been watching your family all summer,

89
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,105
and we've seen
some disturbing things,

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,108
but nothing as dangerous
as what your uncle is hiding.

91
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,084
Somewhere hidden
in this shack is a doomsday device!

92
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,781
Trigger, you take
the children.

93
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:09,333
I'll talk to the old man.
Sorry to break it to you, kids,

94
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:10,885
but you don't know
your uncle at all.

95
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,889
- Icy pop, clear!
- Hey!

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,317
Kids! You gotta believe me!
For once I'm actually innocent!

97
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,510
Kids!

98
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,458
¶ Headin' into work,
doot doo doo doo doo ¶

99
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:35,718
Ground team,
move move move!

100
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,786
Break down the door!

101
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,245
Or... maybe not.

102
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,910
Stanford Pines, you
stand accused of theft of government waste,

103
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,554
conspiracy, and possession
of illegal weapons.

104
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,547
How do you plead
to these charges?

105
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,684
Uh..."guiltoccent".
I mean, "innoguilty".

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,353
Um...can I
have my phone call?

107
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,733
Okay, give me whatever you
got that comes with a free toy.

108
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,060
<i> Soos! </i>

109
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,563
Mr. Pines? Is this some sort
of possession situation?

110
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,564
<i> Soos, pick up! </i>

111
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,174
Mr. Pines,
what happened?

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,651
I heard you got arrested
or something?

113
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:17,852
I had to go get
some panic food.

114
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,887
<i> Listen, I need
something from you. </i>

115
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,697
You know that vending machine
in the gift shop?

116
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,308
<i> I need you to guard it
with your life. </i>

117
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,934
<i> No matter what happens,
no matter who talks to you,</i>

118
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,436
<i> don't let them touch
that machine! </i>

119
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:33,909
<i>Time for a repair guy...
to become a repair   man. </i>

120
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,303
Sir, your Junior Yum-Yum
Baby-Time Kiddo Meal?

121
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,555
Just put one in my mouth.

122
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:41,976
Let's do this.

123
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,401
<i> We've got Mr. Pines
in custody.</i>

124
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:51,936
<i> Our men are searching
the shack for that device.</i>

125
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,405
<i> You take care
of those kids. </i>

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,307
What are you
gonna do to us?

127
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:59,343
We'll be taking you
to child services. -Boo!

128
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,288
In the meantime, enjoy
some mindless reality TV...

129
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,806
designed to pacify you
and make you stop asking questions.

130
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,926
<i> I'm about to make
the incision. </i>

131
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,569
<i> Ker-prank!
Aah! </i>

132
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:11,847
<i> You're watching   Ker-Prank'd
with Justin Ker-Prank.</i>

133
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:14,216
Dipper, this is crazy.

134
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,968
There's no way Stan
was stealing hazardous waste.

135
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:17,127
We gotta clear his name!

136
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:17,928
Hmm...

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,859
Wait a minute,
the security tapes!

138
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,552
Didn't Stan say he was
restocking the gift shop last night?

139
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,880
If we could get
the Mystery Shack's surveillance tapes,

140
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,840
we could prove
he's innocent!

141
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,668
We just need to think
of a way out of here.

142
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,612
Think, Mabel. Think.

143
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,128
No!

144
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:54,723
Oh oh oh aah!

145
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,566
Aah!
Aah!

146
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,219
Mayday, mayday!
Agent down!

147
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,616
Uhh! Darn branch!

148
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,351
Uhh!
Ha ha, yes!

149
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,479
Backup!
Requesting backup! Aah!

150
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,111
Come on, Dipper.
We're gonna go clear our uncle's name.

151
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:18,030
Oh, you poor kids.
You really think your uncle's innocent?

152
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,042
I've seen it all before.
False names, double lives.

153
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,718
One minute,
they're playing with water balloons.

154
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:24,687
The next,
they're building doomsday devices.

155
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,864
Your uncle scammed
the whole world.

156
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:27,456
You gonna let him
scam you, too?

157
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,203
You-you don't know
what you're talking about.

158
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,080
You're gonna regret this!

159
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:34,880
Aah!

160
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,888
Only five more hours
till it happens.

161
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,823
I gotta be there!
Come on, Stan,

162
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:53,448
you gotta think
of a way out of this.

163
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,326
Think!
Think!

164
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:56,969
Huh?

165
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:05,919
They're getting stronger!

166
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:06,620
Of course, that's it!

167
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:12,943
H-hey! Whoa!

168
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,804
Is it just me,
or did the entire world just hiccup?

169
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,039
I'm sure it's just
a baby-sized earthquake.

170
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,841
Aww, baby-sized!

171
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,463
It's happening!
The end's times!

172
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,516
When that machine activates,
I gotta get outta town!

173
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:30,978
Git in there,
raccoon wife, git!

174
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,531
Eh?

175
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,690
All right,
here's the plan.

176
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,316
I'll take out
those two guard guys,

177
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,477
you karate-chop
the other dude in the neck,

178
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:48,621
and then we'll back-flip
through the front door!

179
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,514
Mabel, aren't you forgetting
the simpler solution?

180
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,074
Oh, right.

181
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:54,017
So is it a rock,
or is it a face?

182
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,003
I think...
it's a metaphor.

183
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,227
All right.
If I was Stan,

184
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,229
where would I hide
those surveillance tapes?

185
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,638
Wait! The Antelabbit!

186
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:24,014
Don't you mean
"jackalope"?

187
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:25,074
Pfft!
That can't be right.

188
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,654
- Yes!
- Yes!

189
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:31,330
It's this week!
This is it!

190
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,860
<i> Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!</i>

191
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:38,796
Someone yelled
"Wormy Dance". We had to!

192
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:39,672
Fast-forward.

193
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:45,795
Ha! There it is!
Stan restocking, like he said.

194
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,379
And the date shows
it was last night!

195
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,389
It's proof!
He's innocent!

196
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,608
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, maybe he's just going to the bathroom outdoors,

197
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:00,484
the way nature intended.

198
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,959
Oh, no.
Stan, you didn't!

199
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,561
Don't panic.
That could be anyone in that suit.

200
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,098
<i> Aah! Hot Belgian waffles!</i>

201
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,335
<i> Wait, I'm alone.
I can swear for real! Son-of-a...</i>

202
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,314
That's him, all right.

203
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,334
Okay, okay.
So maybe Grunkle Stan stole some toxic waste.

204
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,063
That doesn't mean he's leading
a nefarious double life.

205
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,764
Mabel,
I'm not so sure about that.

206
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,379
What?
What is all this?

207
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:39,898
Stetson Pinefield?

208
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,310
Hal Forrester?
Andrew "8-Ball" Alcatraz?

209
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,471
These are fake IDs, Mabel!

210
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,098
You wouldn't need these
unless you were trying to hide your real identity.

211
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,491
But why would Stan
do that?

212
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,784
What?

213
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,494
"Stan Pines Dead"?

214
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,939
"Foul play suspected
in Pines' death".

215
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,967
"Fiery car crash,
brakes cut..." By who?

216
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:12,756
"Unnamed grifter
at large"?

217
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,350
Why would they call him
"unnamed"?

218
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,326
Unless Stan...

219
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,453
...isn't...

220
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,979
...Stan?!
Stan?!

221
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:28,514
Stan Pines is dead?

222
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,182
Then who have we
been living with?

223
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,658
It doesn't make
any sense!

224
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,994
There has to be
some explanation.

225
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,754
Maybe we're getting
Ker-Pranked!

226
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,048
Justin Ker-Prank
is gonna jump up

227
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,167
from behind one of these
plants, any minute now!

228
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:45,263
Any minute, Justin.

229
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,183
Can't believe it!
This whole summer I've been looking for answers,

230
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,343
and the biggest mystery
was right under our nose.

231
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:52,279
There's gotta be
some kind of explanation in here, somewhere.

232
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,513
What the--?

233
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,966
"Secret Code to Hideout"?

234
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,818
Let me see that!

235
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:00,763
A1, B, C3...

236
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,447
I've never seen
a code like this.

237
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,149
Wait, I have!

238
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,818
Dipper,
it's the vending machine!

239
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,626
All right, Pines.
Play time is over.

240
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,727
Chopper's ready
to dust off to Washington.

241
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,221
I'll enjoy
putting you away.

242
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,499
What?Um, can't we stick
around for maybe one minute,

243
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,809
uh, one minute,
thirty seconds?

244
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,779
We're not falling
for your games, Pines.

245
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,339
You've been running
your whole life.

246
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,275
Your time is finally up.

247
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,853
Bathroom break?
Just gimme 15 seconds.

248
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,012
Sorry, but you've got
a flight to catch.

249
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,270
Oh, yeah?
So do you!

250
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:42,904
Huh?

251
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:49,987
Whoa, whoa, hey!

252
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,913
Aah!

253
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,504
Hey!
Dang it, get back here!

254
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,539
Men, get him!

255
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,837
No! You won't get away
with this! Aah!

256
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,167
- Aah!
- Gonna get ya! Gonna get ya!

257
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,877
Ow!

258
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,714
Whoa!

259
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:17,364
You know where
the Mystery Shack is?

260
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,823
Uh, yeah.

261
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,341
Okay,
here's a hundred bucks.

262
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,085
Drive as far away
from the Shack as possible,

263
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,770
and don't stop
when the cops start chasing you!

264
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,126
He's getting away!

265
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,279
Obviously,
follow that cab!

266
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,710
Stanford escaped!
He's at large!

267
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,786
We need to sweep the town!
Move, move, move!

268
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,185
All right, Soos,
remember the plan.

269
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,203
Protect the machine,
earn Stan's trust,

270
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,239
legally get adopted by Stan,
change name to Stan Junior.

271
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,607
Soos!
Aah!

272
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,009
Oh, kids,
where have you been?

273
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,127
W-what are you doing here?

274
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:05,962
Stan gave me a mission
to protect this machine.

275
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:08,090
Ha! And I thought
I loved snacks!

276
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,417
Soos, listen.
Something huge is going on here.

277
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,277
If Stan is hiding
some dangerous secret,

278
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,729
we need to find out
what it is!

279
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,956
I need you
to step aside.

280
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:21,278
Yeah, just let us through so we
can prove this is all just a big misunderstanding.

281
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,705
Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised
Stan I would guard this with my life.

282
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,184
I'm sorry, Soos.

283
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,954
Aah! Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!

284
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,839
- Please, Soos!
- C'mon, Soos!

285
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,941
Aw, c'mon, I don't wanna
fight you guys!

286
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,960
This hurts me
more than it hurts you!

287
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,188
Aah!

288
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,722
Seriously, it hurts me
way more than it hurts you.

289
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,587
Aah!

290
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:51,567
Ohh...

291
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,499
It's like something
from a video game.

292
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,243
Or a dream.

293
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:02,077
Or a nightmare.

294
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,127
I gotta be there
when it happens! Aah!

295
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:21,655
Guys, are we dreaming?
Somebody wake me up.

296
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,282
This... can't be real.

297
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,319
I don't understand.
Why would Mr. Pines have all this?

298
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,913
It's just like
that bunker in the woods.

299
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,324
But what is it doing
underneath the Mystery Shack?

300
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,811
Okay, okay,
so he's got a huge, gigantic lab.

301
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,537
That doesn't mean
anything bad.

302
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:38,530
Everyone's got secrets!

303
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,575
It's still Stan,
and he loves us.

304
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,769
And we love him,
right?

305
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,929
Can't be...
it's impossible.

306
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,708
The other two journals?!

307
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,885
All this time,
all this time, Stan had them?!

308
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,422
I can't believe it!
Was anything he said to us real?

309
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,098
Why would he have
those journals?

310
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,650
Maybe he's the author.

311
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,793
Or maybe he stole them
from the author!

312
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,804
Maybe the reason he has
all of those fake IDs

313
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,715
is because he is
a master criminal,

314
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,224
and this machine
is his master plan!

315
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,523
Whoa!

316
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,287
"I was wrong the whole time".

317
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,865
"The machine was meant to create
knowledge, but it is too powerful!"

318
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,817
"I was deceived,
and now it is too late!"

319
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,551
"The device,
if fully operational,

320
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,620
could tear our universe apart!"

321
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:32,467
"It must not fall
into the wrong hands".

322
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:35,087
"If the clockever reaches
zero, our universe is doomed."

323
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,884
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!

324
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,640
The agents were right!
We have to shut it down!

325
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,069
There! Quick!

326
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:03,615
Turn these! Together!

327
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:07,828
That's it!
The shutdown switch!

328
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:14,684
This all stops now!

329
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,046
Don't touch that button!

330
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:24,136
Dipper, just back away.

331
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:29,666
Please don't pressthat
shutdown button. You gotta trust me.

332
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,301
And I should trust you, why?

333
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:33,136
After you stole
radioactive waste,

334
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,905
after you lied to us
all summer!

335
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,923
I don't even know
who you are!

336
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,592
Look, I know this
all seems nuts,

337
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,051
but I need that machine
to stay on.

338
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,103
If you just
let me explain...

339
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,780
Oh! Oh, no!
Brace yourselves!

340
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

341
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,209
Aah!

342
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,493
T-minus 35 seconds.

343
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:07,404
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

344
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,890
Whoa, aah!

345
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:10,932
Dipper!

346
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,487
Mabel! Hurry!
Shut it down!

347
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,274
No!

348
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,376
Mabel, Mabel, wait!

349
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,595
Stop! Uhh!

350
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,139
Soos, what are you doing?
I gave you an order!

351
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,149
Sorry, Mr. Pines,
if that is your real name,

352
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:30,643
but I have a new mission now,
protecting these kids!

353
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:32,179
Soos, you idiot,
let me go!

354
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,774
- Let me go!
- C'mon!

355
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,885
Mabel, press
the red button!

356
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,853
- Shut it down!
- No, you can't! You gotta trust me!

357
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:45,399
Grunkle Stan,I don't even
know if you're my Grunkle!

358
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,394
I wanna believe you,
but...

359
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,271
Then listen to me.
Remember this morning,

360
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:52,249
when I said I wanted
to tell you guys something?

361
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:52,891
T-minus 20 seconds.

362
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:00,315
I wanted to saythat you're
gonna hear some bad things about me,

363
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,401
and some of 'em are true,
but trust me, everything I've worked for,

364
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,812
everything I care about,
it's all for this family.

365
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:08,256
Mabel,
what if he's lying?

366
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,508
This thing coulddestroy the
universe! Listen to your head!

367
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,085
Look into my eyes, Mabel!

368
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,719
You really think
I'm a bad guy?

369
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,640
He's lying!
Shut it down, now!

370
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,549
Mabel, please!

371
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,500
Ten, nine...

372
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:24,639
Grunkle Stan...

373
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,715
Six, five...

374
00:20:28,387 --> 00:20:31,188
I trust you.

375
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,056
Mabel, are you crazy?!
We're all gonna...

376
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:33,932
One.

377
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,394
No!

378
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:38,361
Aah!

379
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:39,354
Aah!

380
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:40,230
Aah!

381
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,493
W-what?
Who is that?

382
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,812
The author
of the journals.

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,984
My brother!

384
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,693
Is this the part
where one of us faints?

385
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,750
Oh, I am so on it, dude.
