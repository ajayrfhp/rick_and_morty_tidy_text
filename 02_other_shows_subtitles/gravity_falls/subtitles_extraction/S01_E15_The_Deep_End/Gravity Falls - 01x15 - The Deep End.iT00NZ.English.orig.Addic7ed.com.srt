1
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,870
Gravity Falls  S01E15  The Deep End

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,000
Watch out, Gravity Falls,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,580
Because at 110 degrees

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,340
we're looking at the hottest day of the summer!

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,010
All in favor of doing nothing all day, say...

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,020
I'm gonna throw this pig out of the house!

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,680
You called my bluff, pig.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,520
On the bright side, pun very much intended,

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,560
It's opening week at the Gravity Falls pool.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,720
Gravity Falls pool?

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,460
- Today? 
- Pun intended?

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,690
Quick! To the car!

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,730
Hey, kids, a little help here.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,800
All right, off to the pool.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,370
And remember to be on alert for random wildfires.

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,810
Wait, what?

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,550
He'll be fine.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,590
All right, who wants to do a cannonball?

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,560
Cannonball!

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,720
Ah, the pool.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,730
Sparkling oasis of summer enchantment.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,730
Yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,630
It's like the bus, but wet.

24
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,740
Why would a sun need to wear sunglasses?

25
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,400
It's best not to think about it.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,410
Whoa, whoa! Stop the presses!

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Who's that?

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,350
Oh, yeah. Word is, dude never leaves the pool.

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,350
People say he's a "Mysterious loner."

30
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,390
Is it getting hot out here, or is it just that guy?

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,620
It's the hottest day of the year, Mabel.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,630
Besides, can't you go for one week

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,560
without having a new crush on some random guy?

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,660
Uh-uh.

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,330
Look at his little moustache hairs!

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,740
You are clearly enamored. Go to him.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,410
- Hey, come on! 
- Watch it, kid!

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,410
Oops, sorry!

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,710
It's so beautiful!

40
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,710
Eh, Mabel's all talk. You wanna know a secret?

41
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,610
She's never even kissed a guy before.

42
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,520
She always messes it up somehow.

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,750
Oy, women!

44
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,520
Hey, Mr. Pines.

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,560
Wendy? Where's the lifeguard?

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,620
I am the lifeguard.

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,360
I make the rules, sucka! Boosh!

48
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,400
Aah! She's attacking me with water!

49
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,430
Wow. You work here?

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,600
I found out lifeguards get free snack privileges.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,740
Plus, I get the best seat in the house.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,740
Yeah, you do!

53
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,480
I've been laughing for too long.

54
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,540
Dude, are you and Wendy having a secret staring contest?

55
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,650
'cause I think you're winning--

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,750
Soos! Shh!

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,480
So, hey, you wanna go chuck more water balloons at grunkle Stan?

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,320
I'd love to, but I gotta spend the day doing tryouts.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,320
We're looking for a new assistant lifeguard.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,330
Hey!

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,390
Hey...

62
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,590
What if I was assistant lifeguard?

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,660
That would be so much fun! You're totally in, dude!

64
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,500
You just have to check in with my boss first, Mr. Poolcheck.

65
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,700
Your boss?

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,410
I'm gonna get you!

67
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,560
Wow! Oh, my gosh, how crazy, bumping into you here,

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,520
even though we don't know each other.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,690
How long have you been underwater?

70
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,500
That doesn't matter!

71
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,670
So, hey! My name's Mabel.

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,670
Hola.

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,340
Whoa! Are you Australian?

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,700
I am charmed by your sense of humor...

75
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,510
And your bold lack of water wings.

76
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,510
You're so funny!

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,350
And your hair is beautiful.

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,450
No, no, it has silly tangles.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,450
Mind if I...

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,290
Why, Mabel, you are so forward.

81
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,690
This is it! He likes you!

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,590
Go for it, Mabel! It's time!

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,360
Ask him out on a date!

84
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,430
So, hey, you wanna go dry off? Maybe hit the snack bar or--

85
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,560
I--I'm afraid I cannot.

86
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,770
For I have a terrible secret!

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,700
I must go.

88
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,710
I'm upset.

89
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,780
Yet, intrigued.

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,580
And that is why I think I'd make a good lifeguard assistant.

91
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,550
Spf 100? Good. I like you.

92
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,660
But this isn't an easy job. It's anarchy out there.

93
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,730
I think I can handle it.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Can you handle this?!

95
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,270
I lost my hand to a pool filter!

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,700
The pool may seem friendly,

97
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,700
But she can turn on you in an instant!

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Which is why you must respect her rules!

99
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,540
Do you think you have what it takes, boy? Do you?!

100
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,710
Sure. I guess.

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,420
Welcome to the deep end, son.

102
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,420
Well, thanks. I--

103
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,720
Yep, oh, this is happening.

104
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,660
There she is, Soos.

105
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,560
Equidistant from the snack bar and the bathroom,

106
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,330
Just the right amount of sun and shade.

107
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,470
and pointed away from where old man Mcgucket lotions himself.

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,570
The perfect lawn chair.

109
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,610
The legends that you told me in the car were true.

110
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,610
I just can't believe it wasn't already taken!

111
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,350
And now to sit on it, thereby claiming it as my own.

112
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,550
What?!

113
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,390
Why, hello, Stanford.

114
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,290
Gideon! Get out of my chair, kid!

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,730
Oh, my, was this your chair? I had no idea.

116
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,560
Yes, I did, Stan. I knew.

117
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,300
Move it, you little troll!

118
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,700
First come, first serve!

119
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,670
I'll first serve you!

120
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,310
Come on, Wendy!

121
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,380
You can't do this to an old man!

122
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,550
Sorry, Stan. It's not up to me.

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,350
Actually, it is.

124
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,350
Hey, Wendy. I got this job!

125
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,350
Sweet! Wanna go abuse our power?

126
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,520
But what if poolcheck catches us?

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
He seems emotionally unstable.

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,530
Nah, don't worry, man.

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,370
You just gotta be sneaky about your rule-breaking.

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,770
Race you to the no running sign!

131
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
How long you in for?

132
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,550
Two hours, for roughhousing.

133
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,610
But I'm innocent!

134
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,380
Pool jail ain't so bad...

135
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,250
As long as you don't wind up in solitary.

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,320
It's the nights that are the hardest.

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,660
Hey, there!

138
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,330
I brought you a sandwich.

139
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,570
It's sort of wet, but it's still good. Blop.

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,340
I like sharing things-- sandwiches, secrets...

141
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,740
Share your secret, beautiful stranger.

142
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,680
That wet sandwich does look delicious.

143
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,510
Oh, very well.

144
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,280
But you must never tell another living soul my terrible secret.

145
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,290
You have to stay away from me because I am...

146
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,290
A merman.

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Oh, thank goodness.

148
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,810
I thought you were gonna say you had a girlfriend.

149
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,800
A merman! Ha!

150
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,370
I should have known from your strange foreign fish language.

151
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,540
It is spanish.

152
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,440
Your voice is so deep and masculine. How old are you?

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,610
I am 12 years old.

154
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,310
Merman's voices change when we are, like, three.

155
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,650
So what's your name?

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,450
There are some who call me...

157
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,720
Mermando.

158
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,550
This is because Mermando is my name.

159
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,390
But I don't understand, Mermando.

160
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,760
What's a guy like you doing in a public pool?

161
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,630
It is a tragic story, Mabel.

162
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,400
I was swimming with my friends, the mighty dolphins,

163
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,300
In the gulf of mexico, when I was ensnared!

164
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,740
Earl, did we just catch ourselves

165
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,610
some kind of beautiful man-fish?

166
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,740
Let's feast on his flesh!

167
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,740
The cargo was headed for gravity falls.

168
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,610
Using all my strength, I tried to escape back home,

169
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,320
but it was not to be.

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,590
I would have died of dehydration,

171
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,490
were it not for the kindness of the forest animals.

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Continue licking! Oh!

173
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,370
But now that you know what I am,

174
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,470
you must be seriously weirded out.

175
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,480
What?! I don't care that you're a merman!

176
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,310
You're, like, the coolest guy I've ever met.

177
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,710
And you can play at least one chord on the guitar.

178
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,720
Oh, Mabel. I have never met another human like you.

179
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,620
Would you care to join me in a game of the marco polo?

180
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,560
Oh, yes, Mermando! Yes!

181
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,390
You're covering my gills. I cannot breathe.

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,360
Weird.

183
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Ooh! My cheeks are baby soft!

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,740
Look at him, that smug chair-stealing jerk!

185
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,000
But I can't touch him,

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,580
or the pool patrol will throw me in pool jail.

187
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,520
Yes. Yes! Burn the child!

188
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Aah! My eyes!

189
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,690
Deal with it.

190
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,590
Soos.

191
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,760
Inflatable duck guy? Is that you?

192
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,730
Yes, Soos. I can talk.

193
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,730
Oh, my gosh, I knew you guys were secretly alive. I knew it!

194
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,470
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

195
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,640
My people have been enslaved, Soos. You must free us.

196
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,710
The inflatable pool duck revolution is at hand.

197
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,480
Pools closing! Clear out, everyone!

198
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,550
- Poolcheck! - Hide!

199
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,450
Out! Do not touch!

200
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,690
Assistant lifeguard!

201
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,690
Have a good night, son. Lock up the supplies for me.

202
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,600
The pool, she closes.

203
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,770
Can I see you tonight?

204
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,440
Sure. Where? Wanna go for a walk?

205
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,440
Merman. I am a merman.

206
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,770
Oh, right. Then I'll be back tonight.

207
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,590
Look, here's a scrapbook of human stuff.

208
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,360
Here's me standing with my legs,

209
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,590
And here I am kicking Dipper in his legs.

210
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,600
He couldn't move his legs after that.

211
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,570
Can you imagine, not having legs!

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,700
Let's skip this part.

213
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,400
And here's my whole family kickboxing!

214
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,440
What's wrong?

215
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,810
I, too, used to have a family once,

216
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,820
Back in the ocean.

217
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,350
How I miss them.

218
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,390
Mermando, why don't you just leave the pool?

219
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,560
I tried only once.

220
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,560
But escaping this pool required a plan

221
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,560
that was bold and daring.

222
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,550
And then the wolves came.

223
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,750
No, I am glad that I am here, because I met you.

224
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
This is it, Mabel.

225
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,720
First kiss moment, here we come.

226
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,790
Just go for it!

227
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,490
What are you doing with your mouth?

228
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,560
Me? Nothing! This? I was just eating some sour candy.

229
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,400
So my lips were doing that 'cause the candy was so sour.

230
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,670
Can I have some candy?

231
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
No.

232
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,540
What the--

233
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,440
- I'm scared! 
- Me, too!

234
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,540
One hundred points!

235
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,710
Dude, with this job,

236
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,380
You and me are gonna be having fun all summer!

237
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,520
All summer?

238
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,520
Pines, here, now!

239
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,360
You gave me your word that you

240
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,620
would respect the sacred rules of this municipal pool!

241
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,730
Mr. Poolcheck, are you crying?

242
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,560
That's not important right now!

243
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,630
You are on thin ice, boy. You wanna keep this job?

244
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,630
Well, some maniac broke into the supply closet last night

245
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,700
And destroyed our one and only pool skimmer!

246
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,640
I want you on a stake out.

247
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,610
If one more supply gets taken, you're fired!

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
I won't let you down!

249
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,380
Mermando, get ready! I'm gonna bring the heat!

250
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,650
Mermando, are you okay?

251
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,490
Oh, it's your family, isn't it? Are you thinking about them?

252
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,730
Mermando, enough is enough!

253
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,530
I care about you too much to see you like this.

254
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,600
We're gonna bust you out of here and get you back to your family.

255
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,600
But, Mabel, escape is impossible!

256
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,610
We're breaking you out of here tonight!

257
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,890
Whoops! Sorry about that. Water.

258
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,320
All right, Dipper, here's the plan.

259
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Catch the trespasser, protect the supplies,

260
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,200
Keep job at pool, and eventually marry Wendy.

261
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
Freeze!

262
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,330
Grunkle Stan?

263
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,060
I, uh, I'm sleepwalking.

264
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,330
Also, now I'm sleep-talking.

265
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,030
Nice hat, by the way.

266
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,870
You! You're the one destroying pool supplies!

267
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,100
What? No! My crime is a lot better than that.

268
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,740
I'm gonna get that seat,

269
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,740
and be ready in the morning when Gideon comes.

270
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,740
Then maybe I'll destroy some pool supplies. Night's still young.

271
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,880
Sheesh, all right, I'm going!

272
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,180
Hey!

273
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,120
Mabel!

274
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,060
Are you ready to see your family?

275
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,730
Yes, but how can I, a merman, possibly escape?

276
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,100
Okay, my original plan was to tape together a bunch fish sticks

277
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,900
to make you a prosthetic pair of people legs.

278
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,670
Intriguing.

279
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,530
But then I realized that

280
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,770
I could just transport you in this cooler.

281
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,920
Hey! Who's there!

282
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,750
Quick! Hide me! My kind must not be seen!

283
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,280
Mabel? Is there anyone not breaking into the pool tonight?

284
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,090
What, is Soos here too?

285
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,190
I'm okay.

286
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,190
Go home, Soos.

287
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,200
You got it.

288
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,200
So, why are you here?

289
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,900
Uh, no reason.

290
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,670
Did that cooler just clear its throat?

291
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,010
Don't be silly. There certainly isn't

292
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,770
a merman in there, if that's what you're implying.

293
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,940
Who said anything about a merman?

294
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,250
Mabel, I don't have time for your games.

295
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,380
If you don't give me those supplies,

296
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,040
I'll lose the coolest job ever!

297
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,880
I understand.

298
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,980
Hey, look! Wendy in a bikini!

299
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,990
Really? At night?

300
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Sorry, Dipper!

301
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,300
Mabel!

302
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,890
Go, Mabel, go!

303
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,900
We can't all be saved.

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,770
I'm gonna get you home!

305
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Hand over the pool supplies in the name of pool law!

306
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,040
Pool law is dumb! And so is your hat!

307
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,710
Look! Gravity Falls lake!

308
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,020
The coast is clear.

309
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,920
Now all I have to do is wait here 15 hours

310
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,820
Until the pool opens.

311
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,790
This was a good plan.

312
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,600
I think someone just sped by.

313
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,600
Probably just a dream.

314
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,740
With you, every day is a dream.

315
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,710
I cannot breathe!

316
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,840
You must hurry!

317
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm okay.

318
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
All right, the jig is up! Hand over that cooler!

319
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,560
Never!

320
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,730
Why not? Why do you even need it?

321
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,900
I needed the cooler to save my new friend

322
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,900
because he needs to go home and he's really nice.

323
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,570
And we combed each others' hair.

324
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,570
And he needs to be in the cooler because he breathes water

325
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,570
because he's a merman!

326
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,910
Hola.

327
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
Whoa! Way to bury the lead, Mabel.

328
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,810
Dipper, Mermando the merman. He's a merman.

329
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,650
Nice to meet you! Also, I think I am dying.

330
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,790
Water!

331
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,520
Agua! Yo necesito!

332
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,920
Oh, no! Mermando!

333
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,760
Dipper, you're a lifeguard! Give him CPR!

334
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,990
Mermen don't breathe air!

335
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,900
Then give him reverse CPR! Doi!

336
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,910
I hate this!

337
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
I hate this!

338
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Blackmail!

339
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,750
Thank you for saving me,

340
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,590
But why didn't you just roll me into the lake?

341
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,960
I am weak from coughing.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
How will I get my family to hear my call

343
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,800
From the mighty depths of the ocean?

344
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,770
I've got it. B.R.B.

345
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,940
Problem solved!

346
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,810
Mabel, those are pool supplies. I'll get fired!

347
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,810
Dipper! Don't you know what it's like to fall for someone,

348
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,150
Even though you know in

349
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,750
your heart that it'll probably never work out?

350
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,850
But you'd do anything for that person?

351
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,990
Give Mermando the megaphone.

352
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,660
Thanks, Dip.

353
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,960
Mabel, I have never met anyone like you.

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Same here.

355
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,870
Except for a zombie, a gnome, and a couple of cute vampires.

356
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,600
I don't remember the vampires.

357
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,940
I don't tell you everything.

358
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,010
Well, Mermando, I guess this is it.

359
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,540
Not quite. This is!

360
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,810
Whoa! Okay, that's gross. Ugh.

361
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,690
That was my first kiss!

362
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,690
Hey, it was also kind of your first kiss too, huh? Huh?

363
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,920
Please don't involve me in this.

364
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,830
Goodbye, Mermando.

365
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,590
Goodbye, Mabel.

366
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,700
You did the right thing, Dipper.

367
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,630
Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,640
Oh, wait, wait! One last thing!

369
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,840
Yes!

370
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
I've always wanted to do that.

371
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,780
A wrecked fence, dents in the pool mobile,

372
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,650
And a missing megaphone?

373
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,690
Who is responsible for this?!

374
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,560
It's my fault, sir. I'm sorry. I got in too deep.

375
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,690
Hand over the whistle, boy!

376
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,770
If one more thing goes wrong today...

377
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,840
You're free now! Free!

378
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,680
Inflatable ducks unite!

379
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,680
You!

380
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,550
Git 'em! Git 'em!

381
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,590
Hey, doofus, you'll never guess what happened.

382
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,660
I just got fired.

383
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,990
- What? Really? 
- Yeah.

384
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,660
I guess Poolcheck found out I was taking too many snacks.

385
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,930
How many?

386
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,700
Hey, wanna go break rules somewhere else?

387
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,700
Of course!

388
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,880
"Dear Mabel, I am home with my family,

389
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,820
And I am very happy..."

390
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,990
Our first kiss will always hold a place in my heart.

391
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,650
Technically hearts...

392
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,130
As a merman I have, like, 17 hearts.

393
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,530
Horrifying but true!

394
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,900
More bottles on the way!

395
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,600
Stanford!

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,700
Well, guess you've won. Put 'er there.

397
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,040
Hey! What the--

398
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,710
Unless perhaps I predicted your plan,

399
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,610
And coated the entire chair with glue last night!

400
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,710
Enjoy your chair... forever.

401
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,920
Kids, get the spatulas! Kids!
