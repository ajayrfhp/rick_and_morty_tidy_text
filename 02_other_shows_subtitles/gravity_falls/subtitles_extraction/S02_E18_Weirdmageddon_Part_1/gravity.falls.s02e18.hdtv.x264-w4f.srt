1
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:06,622
    ( maniacal laughter )
     Oh, it's happening!

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,657
        It's finally,
      finally happening.

3
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:10,559
          ( laughing )

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,961
        Physical form?
     Don't mind if I do!

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,834
    Oh! What just happened?

6
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,937
Oh! Oh, man.
This is bad.

7
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,774
       This is real bad.

8
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,910
       Guys, we've got
         a situation.

9
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:34,683
       ( all exclaiming )

10
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,618
          ( laughter )

11
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,555
    All right, listen up,
    you one-life-spanned,

12
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,823
       three-dimensional,

13
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,591
         five-sensed
        skin puppets.

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,992
    For a trillion years,
      I've been trapped

15
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:45,828
      in my own decaying
          dimension,

16
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,030
  waiting for a new universe
       to call my own.

17
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:50,599
     Name's Bill, but you
         can call me

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,702
   your new lord and master
      for all eternity.

19
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,607
     Now meet the gang of
  interdimensional criminals

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,843
        and nightmares
      I call my friends.

21
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,878
           8 Ball,
           Kryptos,

22
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,814
     The Being Whose Name
     Must Never Be Said.

23
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,716
              Ah, what the heck.

24
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,685
                  It's Zanthar.
                Then of course,

25
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,620
     there's also Teeth,
     Keyhole, Hectorgon,

26
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,889
       Amorphous Shape,
Aronica Pacifier and these guys.

27
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:16,759
       This is our town
          now, boys.

28
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,664
        Now see here,
  you unholy triangle fella.

29
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:27,636
As mayor, I strongly urge you
    to get on outta here.

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,805
      Yeah. Things with
      one eye are weird.

31
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,640
We don't like
out-of-towners.

32
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,909
        We punch what
     we don't understand.

33
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:35,944
       I would just like to say
     that as a rich capitalist,

34
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,846
                 I welcome your
               tyrannical rule.

35
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,748
               Perhaps I can be
               one of your, uh,

36
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,750
                    horsemen of
                the apocalypse.

37
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:44,019
            - Dad!
     - Not now, sweetie.
  The grownups are talking.

38
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,954
           Oh, wow,
    that's a great offer.

39
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,756
      How about instead,
   I shuffle the functions

40
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,658
        of every hole
        in your face?

41
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,031
       ( evil laughter )

42
00:01:56,065 --> 00:02:00,903
           Durland!
 My precious Deputy Durland!

43
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,672
       It's time we do
    a little redecorating.

44
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,575
      I could really use
    a castle of some kind.

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,681
  And how about some bubbles
       of pure madness?

46
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,983
         ( screaming )

47
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,919
    This party never stops.

48
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:19,922
        Time is dead,
 and meaning has no meaning.

49
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,857
          Existence
       is upside down,

50
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,526
      and I reign supreme.

51
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,796
    Welcome, one and all,
      to Weirdmageddon.

52
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,767
( shrieking )

53
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,640
ow
       the world ends.

54
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,409
               Not with a bang,
          but with a... cuckoo.

55
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,312
       - Weirdmageddon.
     - ( both screaming )

56
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,550
Move it, stretch!

57
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,619
  Hey, we're
  scampering here.

58
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,520
     The rift is shattered.

59
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,489
         Bill's world
    is spilling into ours.

60
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,725
        Every minute,
  his powers grow stronger.

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,628
         Mabel... the rift must
            have cracked inside
                  her backpack.

62
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,730
         She must be in danger.
         I have to go find her.

63
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,498
     Mabel. Come in, Mabel.

64
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,400
             Mabel!

65
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,735
Dipper, listen to me.

66
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,370
We can find
your sister soon,

67
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,305
but first, we have
to stop Bill.

68
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,407
If we can blast him back
through the rip he came out of,

69
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:46,742
we just might
be able to stop him

70
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:49,544
before his weirdness
spreads across the entire globe.

71
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,414
                   Are you sure
                 defeating Bill
              is even possible?

72
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,682
No, I'm not sure.

73
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,751
But being a hero
means fighting back

74
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,719
even when it seems
impossible.

75
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:00,722
    - Will you follow me?
 - To the ends of the earth.

76
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,392
        Good, because
 that's where we're heading.

77
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,627
        You also might
     want to step inside.

78
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,397
        Weirdness wave!

79
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,707
        Ah! Abuelita,
   a tidal wave of madness

80
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,575
       just went over us.

81
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,711
                      Oh, Soos,
           such an imagination.

82
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,446
     Ah!

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,248
You turned into
a chair!

84
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,649
      Why don't you have
      a seat and relax?

85
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,718
What about you,
and my friends?

86
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,254
                  I'll be fine.
        You go help the others.

87
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,689
      When the universe
          is broken,

88
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:36,425
      only one handyman
         can fix it.

89
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,727
I'm coming for you,
friends.

90
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,697
        Time for a nap.

91
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,399
                  Hey!

92
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,301
                That's it, goat.

93
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,670
          It's time I threw you
    off this property for good!

94
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,378
             On second thought,
             I'm gonna run like
                  a coward now.

95
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,747
( loud bleating )

96
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,686
               Freedom, freedom!

97
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,655
         Okay, inmates,

98
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,590
     it's time to review
    your finger paintings.

99
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:12,260
          Good. Nice.

100
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,396
 Gideon, does this look like
     someone who's ready

101
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,664
      to re-enter society?

102
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,266
Gideon's unappreciated
in his time.

103
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,469
       Oh, Ghost Eyes,
   you're making me blush.

104
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,571
     Gideon makes prison
      life worth living.

105
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,272
     ALL: Gideon, Gideon...

106
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,340
     - ( loud rumbling )
      - ( all gasping )

107
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,609
          ( bleating )

108
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,688
( raucous screech )

109
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,524
           Oh, my,
      Bill came through.

110
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,327
           BILL: Ready to cause
              some havoc, boys?

111
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,537
        Ah, my quantum
        destabilizer.

112
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,406
   Been waiting a long time
         to use this.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,409
    We're only gonna have
one chance to take this shot.

114
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,679
        Steady. Steady.

115
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:07,282
             And...

116
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,284
              ( goofy laughter )

117
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:10,452
                  I'm alive now.

118
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,656
            Oh, no!

119
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,661
       Well, well, well.

120
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,564
   And here I thought today
   couldn't get any better.

121
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,237
          Great-uncle Ford!

122
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,306
   Dipper, take my journals.

123
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,610
      Listen. I know of
one other way to defeat Bill.

124
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,379
            It's...

125
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,514
     Oh, no, Dipper, run!
          Get down!

126
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:41,383
     Good old Six Fingers.

127
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,385
      I've been waiting
         an eternity

128
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,389
       - to have a chat
        face to face.
         - ( yells )

129
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:50,425
     Everyone, this Armageddon
           wouldn't be possible

130
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,294
      without help from
       our friend here.

131
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,695
                       Give him
           a six-fingered hand.

132
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,465
   This brainiac is the one
     who built the portal

133
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,400
      in the first place.

134
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,469
                     Don't look
              so sour, Fordsie.

135
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,270
              It's not too late
                    to join me.

136
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,605
    With that extra finger,

137
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,308
      you'd fit right in
       with my freaks.

138
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,443
       I'll die before
         I join you.

139
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,445
I know your weakness, Bill.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,380
          Oh, yeah?
     And I know a riddle.

141
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,217
    - Why did the old man
           do this?
           - This?

142
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,591
       Because I needed
    a new back scratcher.

143
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,293
          ( laughter )

144
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,297
                  That's enough!

145
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,300
            Hand over my uncle,
                       or else!

146
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,636
  Now isn't this...

147
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,638
          interesting?

148
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,441
        My old puppet
    is back for an encore.

149
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,510
          You think
       you can stop me?

150
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,612
     Go ahead, Pine Tree,
    show me what you got.

151
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,313
              I...

152
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,581
             Uh...

153
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,517
        "I, um, I..."
         Do it, kid.

154
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,652
   Do some brilliant thing
that takes me down right now.

155
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,487
What do you got,
Pine Tree?

156
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,456
Everyone's waiting.
Do it!

157
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,324
             Bill!!

158
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,235
        That's right.
    Don't be a hero, kid.

159
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,571
     This is what happens
    to heroes in my world.

160
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,676
       No! The journals!

161
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,645
Not much of
a threat now,
are you?

162
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:20,315
   Now can anyone remind me
      why we came here?

163
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,384
         To get weird!

164
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,253
        That's right.
  VIP party at the Fearamid.

165
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,688
    Oh, and 8 Ball, Teeth,
    you've earned a treat.

166
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,423
 - Have the kid for a snack.
            - Huh?

167
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,528
        Hench maniacs,
          roll out!

168
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,440
       ( Bill cackling )

169
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,678
             ( panting )

170
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,281
           So you wanna eat him
                  or something?

171
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,517
       Oh, definitely.
        Let's eat him.

172
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,519
                   ( screaming )

173
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,109
     <i> We're day three in</i>
<i>this strange cataclysmic event</i>

174
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,144

       <i> Weirdmageddon,</i>

175
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,113

176

180
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,357
        Mabel, it's me.

181
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,226
           So far,
     I've eluded capture,

182
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,195
   but I haven't been able
to find you or Stan anywhere.

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,064
       I don't know if
       you can hear me,

184
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,966
    but wherever you are,
      whatever happens,

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,302
   - I'm going to find you.
    - ( animal shrieking )

186
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,140
   The mall! Maybe they're
       hiding in there.

187
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,250
          - Oh, no.
       - Hey. Hey, you.

188
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,218
         Hey, I wanna
         talk to you.

189
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,955
  I wanna talk to you about
    going inside my mouth.

190
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,256
      I think you wanna
         get in here.

191
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,992
        Hey, you! Hey,
     I'm talkin' to you!

192
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,994
         You don't have to make
         a big deal outta this.

193
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,929
                   Hello. Hello!

194
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,398
                    Why are you
              just ignoring me?

195
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,067
           That's seriously rude

196
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,102
                 to just ignore
             someone like that.

197
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,010
          Stan! Mabel!

198
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,147
     Maybe at least I can
    get something to eat.

199
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,050
       The last nachos
          on Earth.

200
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,153
       Help! The nachos
         tricked me!

201
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,421
                Dipper?

202
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,423
         Wendy? Oh, no.

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,425
 You've been transformed into
  some sort of tree monster.

204
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,995
     It's just camouflage.

205
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,130
My dad made me and my brothers
    do apocalypse training

206
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,431
    every year instead of
          Christmas.

207
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,433
   Guess it's sort of cool
   their paranoia paid off.

208
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,138
       Nice! Bat meat.
   Let me get that for you.

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,142
      Wendy, I'm so glad
         to find you.

210
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,277
I thought everyone
I knew was gone.

211
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,146
            Hey, hey, it's okay.

212
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,248
         We have each other now.

213
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,151
           And Toby Determined,
             who I accidentally
         mistook for a monster.

214
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,388
        This just in:
  This arrow in my shoulder.

215
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,323
              We shouldn't stay
                out in the open
                  for too long.

216
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,991
       Let me show you
         my hideout.

217
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,365
                We were playing
                  Truth Or Dare
                in the cemetery

218
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,300
               when it happened.

219
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,003
             The eyeballs froze
              Nate, Lee, Tambry
                  and Thompson.

220
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,972
   ( cash register jingles )

221
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,174
        Robbie almost got away,
               but had to pause
              to take a selfie.

222
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,942
                 What about you?

223
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,078
I was in a fight
with Mabel when
it happened.

224
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,047
     Uncle Ford asked me
     to be his apprentice

225
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,982
   after the summer was over.

226
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,051
     But that would mean
   I wouldn't go back home.

227
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,153
   It would mean growing up
        without Mabel.

228
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,055
                   Oh, dude.

229
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,322
Mabel didn't
take it well,

230
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,191
and she ran off
into the forest.

231
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,960
She couldn't even
look me in the eye.

232
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,196
      Come on, let's get
       some fresh air.

233
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,297
   Toby, you watch the camp.

234
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,299
      Don't call me Toby
           anymore.

235
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,169
      Call me Bodacious T.

236
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,104
       No one will ever
        call you that.

237
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,972
       ( whining groan )

238
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,178
End of the world.
Man.

239
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,979
              Those death metal
                   album covers

240
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,048
        got it shockingly right.

241
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,250
You know, I used to think
I could get out of anything.

242
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,286
But this?
The journals are destroyed,

243
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,987
       Ford is captured,

244
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,056
       and I can't find
     my family anywhere.

245
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,291
     Bill said it himself.

246
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,326
                There's no room
           for heroes out here.

247
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,161
                 We lost.

248
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,097
Look, dude,
it's not over yet.

249
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,998
You've beaten Bill
twice before.

250
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,400
Why is this time
any different?

251
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,368
         'Cause then,
         I had Mabel.

252
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,237
Then you need to get
Mabel back.

253
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,406
Look, this summer,
I've seen some amazing things,

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,309
but nothing as amazing
as you and your sister.

255
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,177
I don't know if
it's dumb luck,

256
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,113
or yin and yang
or whatever,

257
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,014
       but when you two
        work together,

258
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,150
there's nothing you two
can't accomplish.

259
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,252
You just need
to make up
and team up,

260
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,087
 and save the universe.

261
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,288
                   But how will
               I ever find her?

262
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,389
       ( loud rumbling )

263
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,263
      The shooting star
    from Mabel's sweater.

264
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,298
                She's in there.
                     I know it.

265
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,334
Whoa, is that like
twin ESP?

266
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,102
         No, we don't have that.

267
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,403
  But we do have this thing
     where our allergies

268
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,272
        totally act up
      at the same time.

269
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,040
             ( sneezes )

270
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,375
              Mabel needs us.

271
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,980
How are we gonna get out there
    without being caught?

272
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,181
I have an idea.

273
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,990
     ( dance music plays )

274
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,359
      Spin that person,
      spin that person.

275
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,094
       Spin that person.

276
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,366
    ( raucous laughter )

277
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,268
     Go nuts, guys.

278
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,004
When we're done partying,
I unveil phase two.

279
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,039
           Open up.
     This is the police.

280
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,374
          Time police.

281
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,342
      Just play it cool.
    Ditch the time punch.

282
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,044
     Let me do the talking.

283
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,183
     Bill Cipher, you are
         in violation

284
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,151
         of the rules
        of Spacetime,

285
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,120
   and possessing the body
      of a time officer.

286
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,956
     My body is a temple.
        How dare you?

287
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,357
       Hear this, Cipher.

288
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,960
        Ugh, Time Baby.

289
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,196
If your rip in this dimension
          continues,

290
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,132
       it could destroy
the very fabric of existence.

291
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,202
        Surrender now
     or face my tantrum.

292
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,037
       Oh, no, a tantrum.

293
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,405
      Whatever will I do
         about that?

294
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,373
        How about this?

295
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,913
      - ( all gasping )
         - Aw, snap!

296
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,082
        He just killed
          Time Baby.

297
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,251
        ( all cheering )

298
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,954
    Oh, man, this has gone
      from bad to worse.

299
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,188
      I gotta get out of
         Time Dodge.

300
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,060
        Boss, the pine tree kid
       got away before we could
                       eat him.

301
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,395
       Are you worried he might
     try to cause some trouble?

302
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,065
      Yeah, trouble with
       Mabel's bubble?

303
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,967
      Ha! I'm not worried.

304
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,136
       I've got someone
         on the case.

305
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,409
        The abandoned auto mart.

306
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,212
          Free cars,
   ripe for the hot wiring.

307
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,414
                  We have found
             our ride to Mabel.

308
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,250
                 Wonder if they
                   have a tank.

309
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,252
       I always wanted
       to drive a tank.

310
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,420
                I can't believe
                  this place is
                just abandoned.

311
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,056
     Oh, an air freshener.

312
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,425
   Finally, I'll smell like
          a person.

313
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,995
      Stealy, stealy. Ah!

314
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,230
  Huh, it's gonna take more
        than one dart

315
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,232
         to keep me...

316
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,335
Oh, no. Tony!

317
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,372
Was it Tony?
I can never
remember his name.

318
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,278
    Well, well, looks like
       we got ourselves

319
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,079
          a pair of
       ground walkers.

320
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,915
          Ha ha, ground walkers.

321
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,383
            Ain't got no wheels.

322
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,318
      ( raucous laughter )

323
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,320
       Listen, discount
        auto warriors.

324
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,255
          We just wanna make it
       to that bubble out east.

325
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,257
             We have no quarrel
                      with you.

326
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,993
Oh, but that's
where you're wrong.

327
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,295
   Hands where I can see 'em.

328
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,131
Y'all fellers ain't
goin' nowhere.

329
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,332
             Y'all?

330
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,135
        Fellers? Wait.
           Gideon?

331
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,970
     That's Sheriff Gideon.

332
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,939
    Under the authority of
         Bill Cipher,

333
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,141
       I place you two
        under arrest.

334
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:48,763
          Hi, Wendy.
    Have we formally met?

335
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,798
     ( both grunting )

336
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,000
                 Ooh-wee.

337
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,835
   Look who the apocalypse
         dragged in.

338
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,670
         Y'all are in
      a 12-piece bucket

339
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,672
        of deep fried
         trouble now.

340
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,008
     Ghost Eyes, spittoon.

341
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,943
          It's Gideon.

342
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,578
       And he's gotten
          folksier.

343
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,546
       My old pal Bill
    figured you might try

344
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:06,814
        to rescue Mabel,

345
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,551
      so he appointed me
 master of these wastelands,

346
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,687
   and keeper of the bubble.

347
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,656
  My sweet, precious Mabel's
       trapped inside,

348
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,791
   and I have the only key
     wrapped around my...

349
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,993
       well, I wouldn't
   call it a neck exactly.

350
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,828
  Wrapped around this little
 pocket of fat under my head.

351
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,564
  Gideon, you have no right
    to keep her in there.

352
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,800
   Bill explained it to me
       nice and simple.

353
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,869
        She was always
     destined to be mine,

354
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,637
   and now that I have her
          in a cage,

355
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:30,672
    she'll learn to love me.

356
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,907
  I have an eternity to wait.

357
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:36,911
 Ghost Eyes, ready to escort
our friends to Bill's dungeon?

358
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,780
       No. Hey!

359
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:39,981
       This isn't gonna
        work, Gideon.

360
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,849
          Oh? And why's that?

361
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,851
    Because after I break
       Ghost Eyes' arm,

362
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,787
      and steal that key
       from your neck,

363
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,755
   I'm gonna wear your butt
          on my foot

364
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,991
 - like a rhinestone slipper.
        - ( laughter )

365
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,794
   And what makes you think
     you can do all that?

366
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:55,663
    'Cause I'm a flippin'
          Corduroy!

367
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,670
         Ghost Eyes,
       my hench angel.

368
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:03,905
          ( screams )

369
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,940
           Get back!

370
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:09,544
     Get back, or I will
   drop-kick him, I swear.

371
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,979
You'll never
get away with this,
you hear me?

372
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,782
         Guess what?
       We already did.

373
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:18,786
Wendy, you're
the coolest person I know.

374
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,755
                  I know, dude.
        Tell me about it later.

375
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,893
          After them!

376
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:28,830
  - You want your baby seat?
        - Yes, please.

377
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,668
   We are not letting them
          get Mabel.

378
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:36,037
 Discount Auto Mart warriors,
          roll out!

379
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,648
   Okay, all we have to do
is outrace Gideon's henchmen,

380
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:50,785
      unlock the bubble,
 save Mabel, save the world.

381
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,820
Quick question:
did you ever get
your driver's license?

382
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,722
                Definitely not.
                           Arm!

383
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,700
I can't let 'em
free Mabel.

384
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:08,603
           Remind me why you're
        keeping your girlfriend
      in a prison bubble again.

385
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:11,539
        Have we, the prisoners,
            become the wardens?

386
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,875
She loves me.
She just doesn't
know it yet.

387
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,778
  - Now quit the philosophy.
  - Sorry. It was my major.

388
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,949
Ha! Weirdness bubble
blockin' the path.

389
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,652
Ooh-wee!
We got 'em now.

390
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,621
Watch it. Go around
that bubble field.

391
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,923
        No way around.
Hold on! We're goin' through.

392
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,591
What's even in there?

393
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,627
       ( both screaming )

394
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,007
         ( coughing )
      That was horrible.

395
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,843
Here comes another one, dude.
       Brace yourself!

396
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,565
              ( screams )

397
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,732
Wendy, we're
almost there.

398
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,968
         We just have
      to make that jump.

399
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,904
Total lack of driver's training,
      don't fail me now.

400
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,661
           So close.

401
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,598
        Mabel... I'm...

402
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,032
             almost there.

403
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,672
Hey, Dipper.
How's it hangin'?

404
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,774
           - Soos!
           - Soos?

405
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,910
 Handyman of the apocalypse,
       at your service.

406
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,995
      Soos, how'd you...
        where'd you...

407
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,631
     I've been wandering
 the plains like a desperado,

408
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,866
       helping strangers.

409
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,834
      I guess there are
some folk songs about me now.

410
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,036
          Let me see
   what the damage is here.

411
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,738
      The good news is,
      your arm is okay.

412
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,873
      What's the bad news?

413
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,675
         Bad news is,
   we're surrounded, dudes.

414
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,712
            Ooh-wee!

415
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,047
     I daresay you almost
       had a jump on me

416
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,882
      there for a second.

417
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,017
        But this ain't
 your Gravity Falls anymore.

418
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,786
        Out here, I win.

419
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,856
       ( blows low note )

420
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,694
      Bill's hench bats
   will be here any minute

421
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,730
      to retrieve y'all.
      Mabel's mine now!

422
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,602
            Is she?

423
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,704
         Well, yeah.
     I have her trapped.

424
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,938
      Ergo, Mabel is mine.

425
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,773
     Gideon, listen to me.

426
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,875
       If I've learned
    anything this summer,

427
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,979
     it's that you can't
  force someone to love you.

428
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,648
     The best you can do
       is strive to be

429
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,016
   someone worthy of loving.

430
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,985
        Oh, I'm worthy
          of lovin'.

431
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,754
    These prisoners love me.

432
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,657
      But Mabel doesn't,
   because you're selfish.

433
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,592
      But you can change.

434
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,727
     Bill thinks there's
   no heroes in this world,

435
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,596
   but if we work together
       and fight back,

436
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,797
       we can defeat him.

437
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,833
         You wanna be
        Mabel's hero?

438
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,602
       Stand up to Bill
     and let us save her.

439
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,571
  That's crazy.

440
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,905
You know what Bill
would do to me if
that happens?

441
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,808
    - You scared of Bill?
          - No, I...

442
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,810
It's a complicated
situation.

443
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,946
      Look inside, Gideon.

444
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,748
         If all this
        is for Mabel,

445
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,883
 then ask yourself what Mabel
    would want you to do.

446
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,060
  Dipper, will you tell her
         what I did?

447
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,762
           Of course.

448
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,697
     I hope you're right
         about this.

449
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,033
        Guys, new plan.

450
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,001
   Bill's minions are gonna
     be on us in seconds.

451
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,936
    But I'm not gonna let
      that dumb triangle

452
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,672
      be the warden of me.

453
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,740
   Y'all ready for a good,
 old-fashioned prison brawl?

454
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,676
       We're behind you
      for life, brother.

455
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,910
      Fighting children
          is boring.

456
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,812
     Fighting a chaos god
         sounds fun.

457
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,948
        Let's do this!
     Henchmen, roll out!

458
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,691
            Whew! And I thought
               I was gonna have
                 to throw down.

459
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,760
    Okay. Remember, guys,
   this is a prison bubble

460
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,862
       designed by Bill.

461
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,732
We've gotta prepare ourselves
  for what we find in here.

462
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,600
Whatever it is,
we'll do it together.

463
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,002
         - For Mabel.
         - For Mabel.

464
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,671
           For Mabel.

465
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,653
        Anybody wanna
       get in my mouth?

466
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,954
   I'm a big, hungry monster.

467
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,023
      I'm a big, hungry
        monster here.

468
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,991
 I would really appreciate it
        if someone...

469
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,927
         You, ma'am,
         you, ma'am,

470
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,029
       - how would you
       like to get in--
     - ( woman screams )

471
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,931
        Anybod... hello!

472
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,699
         Hey, sir, sir.

473
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,835
         False alarm.
      It's just a bird.

474
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,069
        Not one person.

475
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,939
        Not one person
   has gotten in my mouth.

476
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,675
    I don't care anymore.
          I just...

477
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,977
          ( sighs )
   I gotta call my mother.
