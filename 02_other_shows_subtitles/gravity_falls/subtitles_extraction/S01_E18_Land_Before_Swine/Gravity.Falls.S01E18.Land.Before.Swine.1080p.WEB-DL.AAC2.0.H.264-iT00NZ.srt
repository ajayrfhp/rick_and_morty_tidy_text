1
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,620
Gravity Falls  S01E18  Land Before Swine

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,730
Focus, deputy. Remember your trainin'.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,880
Easy, easy...

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,520
You're almost there.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,650
Dang it! I almost got the treasure!

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,200
The time we spend together is treasure enough.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,170
Hey! You feel that?

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,170
Reckon we should report that.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,310
Or go for a ride in our new convertible!

10
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,550
Ladies and Gentlemen,

11
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,390
Continuing our mystery tour,

12
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,360
You'll see the world famous outhouse of mystery.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,170
I got stuck in there once!

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Could I go to the bathroom?

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,570
Save all questions until after the tour.

16
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,470
And up ahead if you look really closely--

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,180
Everybody get your cameras,

18
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,180
You're gonna want to see this...

19
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,610
Finally, Waddles,

20
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,610
We have the whole house to ourselves!

21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,220
What do you think, dance party?

22
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,190
I'm not hearing a no!

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,390
Uh-oh, cuddle time. Ha ha ha!

24
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,130
Waddles, can I tell you a secret?

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,160
You're my favorite pig in the whole world.

26
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,500
Mabel! What are you doing on the floor?

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,310
Being cute and great.

28
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,180
And I thought your brother was weird.

29
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,450
No, he's more like, "Oh! Let's solve a mystery!

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,410
I kiss a pillow with Wendy's face drawn on it."

31
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,380
Ha ha! That's pretty good! Kissin' a pillow.

32
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,520
Go! Go! Chew that pant leg!

33
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,360
All right, outside. Now!

34
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,360
No! Grunkle Stan!

35
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,430
It's not safe for waddles outside.

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,260
There's predators! And barbecuers!

37
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,570
That's just the natural order.

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,270
It's not my fault your pig's potentially delicious.

39
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,370
He should be inside like a person.

40
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,110
People don't roll around in their own filth.

41
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,210
Except for Soos.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,110
And we're the lesser for it!

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,280
Maybe we're the ones who should be put outside.

44
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,280
Huh? Huh? Think about it!

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,150
Today's the day, Soos. Thanks for coming along on this mission.

46
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,590
Dude, it's an honor.

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,190
Today I'm sweating from heat and excitement.

48
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,590
There's something hiding in these woods.

49
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,200
Something big enough to rip the roof off a car.

50
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,200
If we get a photo of this thing, we'll be heroes!

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,370
Yeah, we'll get all the babes.

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,370
You'll be fending off smooches with a stick!

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,570
Ha ha! Shut up, man.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,270
With a stick, dude.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,310
Here. Give me a boost.

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,510
Oof! Got it.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,510
Uhh. Is sap supposed to be this sticky?

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,280
If everything goes according to plan,

59
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,620
The creature will grab that steak,

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,320
Cross through the string,

61
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,150
And set off cameras a, b, and c.

62
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,420
And nothing can go wrong.

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
High five.

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,560
This was poorly planned.

65
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,200
- Hey, you! 
- Me?

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,170
- Sick of constantly dropping your baby? 
- Yes!

67
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,470
Hi! I'm Bobby Renzobbi,

68
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,140
And what you need is the huggy wuvvy tummy bundle!

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,110
I can hold ten babies at once!

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
I know what you're thinkin'-- "Does it work for pigs?"

71
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,410
Yeah, it does work for pigs, stupid!

72
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,280
Feel your pig's heartbeat next to yours!

73
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,420
It works for p-I-I-I-I-gs!

74
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,160
Grunkle Stan!

75
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,390
I'm off to get a huggy wuvvy tummy bundle!

76
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,300
Yeesh! Isn't knitting matching sweaters for that pig enough?

77
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,460
Nope. Anyway, I need you to look after

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,170
This little gentleman while I'm gone.

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,440
Not now, kid. I got some tourists comin' through.

80
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,170
Grunkle Stan, I know you're not crazy about Waddles.

81
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,140
He's a fat, naked jerk!

82
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,510
But you do care about me.

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,580
Promise me you won't let him outside?

84
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,280
Fine! Yeah, yeah, I promise.

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,150
Thanks, Grunkle Stan!

86
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,550
I'm watching you, pig.

87
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,090
We did it! It tripped the wire!

88
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,360
Somewhere in these cameras is a photo of that creature!

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,430
I'll go develop the film.

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,300
I'll go make us victory nachos.

91
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,300
Dipper and Soos for life!

92
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,440
And here, ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,570
Is our final exhibit,

94
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,170
The most hideous creatures known to man!

95
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,580
Oh, it's us!

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,150
Right, right. We...

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,250
We have fun here.

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,350
But seriously, folks,

99
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,150
This is something.

100
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,280
I present to you

101
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,250
A unicorn made out of corn:

102
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,160
The cornicorn!

103
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,520
I-I don't know. I'm tired.

104
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,130
What the--?!

105
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,560
What a rip-off!

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Kids, we're leaving.

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,430
No! Noooo!

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,170
Grrr. You!

109
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,540
Come on, come on...

110
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,310
That's a wing!

111
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,150
If camera b got the wing,

112
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,320
Then the one that should have got the rest is...

113
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,120
Camera c!

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,450
The creature!

115
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,220
Who wants victory nachos?

116
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,330
No!

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,330
Dude, don't worry.

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,490
I only ate like a third of 'em.

119
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,300
Half of 'em.

120
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,160
I ate all of 'em, dude.

121
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,570
Just ten minutes without this pig in the house,

122
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,340
Is that so much to ask?

123
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,170
There. If Mabel asks...

124
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,110
This never happened.

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,480
"Oh, but Grunkle Stan! It's not safe out there!

126
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,580
There's predators!" Oh, brother.

127
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,460
I can't believe you, man!

128
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,630
Sorry, dude. I was just so excited! Nachos cause excitement.

129
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,260
Soos, no offense, but you gotta be more careful sometimes.

130
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm mean, what are the

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,810
odds we'll ever get another picture of the--

132
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Dude, did you see that?

133
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
That thing was a dinosaur, bro!

134
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,310
How is it possible a dinosaur survived 65 million years?

135
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,120
Did you see it, Mr. Pines?

136
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,450
- Mr. Pines? 
- It--

137
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,490
- It took him. 
- Took what?

138
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,120
The pig. It took Waddles.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
What'd you say about waddles?

140
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,300
Oh, whoa. Awkward silence.

141
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,910
What's going on? Why are you standing around and where's Waddles?

142
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,200
The good news is, you're gettin' a puppy!

143
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,480
- What happened? 
- Well, see,

144
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,610
Uh, when the--

145
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,380
The pig got eaten by a p-terodactyl, bro.

146
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,580
What?!

147
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,520
Waddles? Waddles!

148
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,250
Where did he go?! How did this happen?!

149
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,460
Grunkle Stan, you didn't put him outside?

150
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,260
What?! No! I didn't put him anywhere!

151
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm not acting suspicious!

152
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,600
You're acting suspicious!

153
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,500
- What's a pig?! 
- Then what happened?

154
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,570
Uh, look, it went down like this, see?

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,540
So there I was, in the living room...

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,510
Tenderly nursing him with only the richest of creams,

157
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,650
When all of a sudden...

158
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,460
So I said...

159
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,730
Aaah! No dice, cowboy!

160
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,330
I start punching him right in the face!

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,370
But he played dirty.

162
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,640
That really happened.

163
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,540
Why?! Why couldn't you have taken me?!!!

164
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,650
Oh, Grunkle Stan, you tried to save him!

165
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,490
Uh, yep. I'm a... great man, all right.

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
You punched a pterodactyl in the face?

167
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,520
I thought you didn't even believe in the supernatural.

168
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Dinosaurs aren't magic. They're just big lizards.

169
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,560
Get off my back!

170
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,300
Oh, Waddles.

171
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,520
That's it.

172
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,530
No pterodactyl messes with my sister.

173
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,470
We're gonna go out there, catch him, and save your pig.

174
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,240
For Mabel, guys!

175
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,340
For Mabel!

176
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,670
But how do we even find the little guy?

177
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,680
We follow that!

178
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,510
Oh, sweet! Yes! Genius!

179
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,580
Or, ya know, we could just call it a day,

180
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,650
Maybe hit the pool hall or, uh...

181
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,520
Yeah! Let's go...

182
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,690
Save waggles!

183
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
- Waddles. 
- Him too.

184
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,560
All right!

185
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,700
That p-terodactyl won't know what hit him.

186
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,730
Huh. It's "Pterodactyl," Man.

187
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,600
Actually, nobody knows how to pronounce it

188
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,640
Because no one was alive back in dinosaur days,

189
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,700
So, uh--

190
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,410
Whoa! Almost ran over my own head there.

191
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,680
Mabel, we've gotta talk.

192
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,610
This is a really high-stakes mission

193
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,410
And I'm a little worried about Soos coming along on this one.

194
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,520
I love the guy, but sometimes he...

195
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,320
Messes stuff up.

196
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,520
What?! Since when?

197
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,650
Sorry, dude.

198
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,360
Sorry, dude.

199
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,590
Look! A fairy!

200
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,360
Ha ha!

201
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,700
Oh, sorry, dude, I killed that fairy.

202
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,330
Let him down easy.

203
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,370
This is so great! You and me, bro!

204
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,280
Best friends,

205
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,660
Fighting and potentially high-fiving dinosaurs.

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,370
Soos, look, I, uh... I gotta tell you something.

207
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,510
Okay, but before you do,

208
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,610
check out these matching shirts I made for us.

209
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,580
Who's this guy right here?

210
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,310
You. Totally you, dude.

211
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,320
And these rays indicate friendship.

212
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,490
So what was it you were gonna tell me again?

213
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,070
Uh... p-terodactyl, here we come!

214
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,330
Yes!

215
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,230
Bros before dinos!

216
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,370
Okay, the red yarn leads to...

217
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,480
Old Man McGucket?!

218
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,440
Howdy, friends!

219
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
What are you doing out here?

220
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,410
You'll never believe me.

221
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,320
So I was doing my hourly hootenanny--

222
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,550
Ohh! This guy.

223
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,490
When this enormous wingly critter

224
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,790
Stole my musical spoons

225
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,390
And flew lickety-split into the abandoned mines down yonder.

226
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,460
Looks kinda hairy down there.

227
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,660
Come on, Grunkle Stan, you can handle it.

228
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,500
You punched a pterodactyl in the face, remember?

229
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,770
Oh, yeah. Ha ha.

230
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,540
I did do that, didn't I?

231
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,510
My! What suspicious laughter!

232
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,780
Guys, we're going in.

233
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,510
Need someone to tag along

234
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,350
and tell weird personal stories?

235
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,350
No, thanks.

236
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,780
So there I am

237
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,690
Fightin' a raccoon for the same piece of meat,

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,690
When our mouths get close and we kiss accidentally.

239
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,420
Uhh. You can't take a hint, can you?

240
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,530
Nope!

241
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,610
- Sweet moses! 
- Razzle dazzle!

242
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,610
Fancy marmalade!

243
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,310
These plants look all jurassic-y.

244
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,580
Huh. This little fella smells like battery acid.

245
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,520
Looks like I lost my sense of smell. Ha ha ha!

246
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,580
Oh, Waddles,

247
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,450
We're gonna find you!

248
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,600
They're all trapped inside tree sap!

249
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,400
That's how they survived for 65 million years.

250
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,770
The summer heat must be melting them loose!

251
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,740
Holy moly! Forget the cornicorn--

252
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,650
This is the attraction of a lifetime!

253
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,750
I could bring people down here

254
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,720
And turn this into some sort of theme park.

255
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,450
"Jurassic sap hole."

256
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,690
Uh, dudes...

257
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,390
Maybe we should keep moving.

258
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,630
This could be a gold mine!

259
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,530
Velvety rope type deal there,

260
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,660
Ticket booth here--ha!

261
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,500
I shoulda put that pig outside ages ago!

262
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,670
- Wait. What did you just say? 
- Hmm? What's that?

263
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,270
You said the dinosaur flew into the house.

264
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,370
No, wait. Uh--

265
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,540
- If you think about it 
- you put waddles outside,

266
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,480
Then you lied to me about it!

267
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,650
And now, thanks to you, my pig could be dead!

268
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,450
Waddles could be dead!

269
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,680
Look, he's an animal. He belongs outside.

270
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,390
No! That's it!

271
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,590
Grunkle Stan, I am never, ever speaking to you again!

272
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,010
Look, you can't be serious.

273
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,430
Oh, is someone talking right now? Because I can't hear them!

274
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,500
Kid!

275
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,460
I can't hear anyone!

276
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,600
No one's talking to me!

277
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,730
Guys, guys, don't fight.

278
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,570
Why can't you be more like me and Dipper?

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,740
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

280
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,470
All we gotta do to find the pig is follow this here yarn.

281
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,340
We just keep following and following,

282
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,510
And when we reach the end--

283
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,480
Wh-which cave was it again?

284
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,650
Ohh, Soos! You lost the trail!

285
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,350
Hey, come on, we'll find our way. Trust me!

286
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,690
Sorry, dude.

287
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,760
That is it! See, this is why I didn't want to bring you along!

288
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,460
What--what do you mean?

289
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,500
I mean, this is really important to Mabel,

290
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,300
And you keep screwing everything up!

291
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,400
You ruined our photograph,

292
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,330
And now you've got us hopelessly lost!

293
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,700
But we're p-terodactyl bros. I made t-shirts.

294
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,640
It's pronounced "Pterodactyl."

295
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,740
And these shirts are useless! They're gigantic!

296
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,740
I...have...A different. Body type, dude!

297
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,480
- Oh, so it's my fault? 
- I just thought, ya know...

298
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,520
Hey! Cheer up, fellers!

299
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,420
I fixed your lantern!

300
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,760
Heh heh! What-- what are we doin'?

301
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,070
Nobody make any sudden movements or loud noises.

302
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,140
Yeehah! We found a pterodactyl!

303
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,920
Guys. We need a plan to get out of here.

304
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,060
Okay, okay. How's about Mabel knits Soos a pig costume...

305
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,130
I like it.

306
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,200
And we use soos as a human sacrifice!

307
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,130
- I like it. 
- Whaddya say, mabel?

308
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,170
Aw, come on,

309
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,930
You can't stop talkin' to me forever.

310
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,940
Yeah, Mabel, we have to work together here.

311
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,200
What? You want to work with Mabel

312
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,840
But not your buddy Soos?

313
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,050
Wait! Did you hear that?

314
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,250
Waddles!

315
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,350
- Wait, kid! 
- Mabel!

316
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,080
Are you nuts?!

317
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,960
Oh, is someone speaking?

318
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,260
Because I can't hear anything!

319
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,230
Oh, no! She's gone deaf with fear!

320
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,360
Mabel, come back here!

321
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,120
Waddles!

322
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh! My waddles!

323
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,010
I'll never lose you again!

324
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,410
Uh... Mabel?

325
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,010
Sh-sh-sh. You're safe now.

326
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,110
Mabel, great, you got him.

327
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,980
Now we gotta get out of here!

328
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,250
Waddles, wait!

329
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,800
Get off me, you dumb pig!

330
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,930
Look out!

331
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,400
- Oh, no! 
- Stan!

332
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Mr. Pines!

333
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,040
Yeah, you would enjoy this.

334
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
Guys, we've gotta save them!

335
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,020
McGucket, do you have an invention

336
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,320
that can distract the pterodactyl?

337
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,390
Do I?!

338
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,290
Nope.

339
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,330
Well, welcome to the world, little feller.

340
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,370
The dumb thing must be hungry.

341
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,820
I guess it's you or me, pig.

342
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,340
What are you lookin' at?

343
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,280
Aw, come on, don't give me that look.

344
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,140
What am I supposed to do, let it eat me?

345
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,050
Oh I get it! You're trying to guilt me.

346
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,320
Well, it ain't workin', pal.

347
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,390
Who cares if you're mabel's favorite thing in the world?

348
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,220
I can live without the kid talkin' to me all the time,

349
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,600
Tellin' me her jokes... makin' me laugh...

350
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Ah, dang it!

351
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,140
Well, this is just about the dumbest thing I've ever done.

352
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,200
You want this pig?

353
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,480
Then you're gonna have to get through me, you flying devil!

354
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,220
Come and get me!!!

355
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,880
Aw, dude. Did he really just

356
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,120
eat that prospector guy? That is messed up!

357
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,190
I'm okay!

358
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,100
What do we do? What do we do?

359
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,500
- We have to get in a straight line. 
- What?!

360
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,430
A pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart

361
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,400
That if you stand right in front of it, it can't see you.

362
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,140
Soos, you've been wrong about stuff all day.

363
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,270
- How can we... 
- Dude, look.

364
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,510
I know I've messed up a lot.

365
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,310
I could be sorta clumsy,

366
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,180
And it's not always as loveable as I think.

367
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,210
But please, as my friend, just trust me on this one.

368
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,320
Get behind me, dudes.

369
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,370
It's working.

370
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,050
Soos, you did it!

371
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,060
Was that...

372
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,030
Stan?

373
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,500
Waddles!

374
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,430
He's punching him in the face!

375
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,360
From heck's heart I stab at thee!

376
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,350
Oh, yes! Ha ha! You're all right, Stan?

377
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,180
Oh, Mr. Pines, you're okay!

378
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,210
Here's your pig, kiddo.

379
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,250
Oooh! Waddles!

380
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,190
Oh... you saved him for me!

381
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,390
Yeah, well, sometimes you just gotta--

382
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,330
Look out!

383
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,280
We're trapped!

384
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,220
Quick! The geyser can shoot us back up!

385
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,220
Come on, go! Go!

386
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,430
Bros before dinos!

387
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,720
I can't believe you did all that for Waddles!

388
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,620
Ah, well, I can't have my favorite niece not talking to me,

389
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,530
And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl and punch him in the face,

390
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,360
Then that's what I gotta do.

391
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,830
That's kinda sappy.

392
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,300
What?! That's how I feel!

393
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,400
No, I mean...

394
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,200
Gotcha!

396
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,240
Check it out, that thing destroyed my vest.

397
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,610
Soos, look!

398
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,580
A real dinosaur tooth? That's awesome!

399
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,250
Not as awesome as you saving us back there.

400
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,390
Pterodactyl bros?

401
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,450
Pterodactyl bros.

402
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,290
Hey, I pronounced it right that time.

403
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,460
Think we need to worry about the rest of those dinosaurs?

404
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,900
I doubt it.

405
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,570
I ate my way through a dinosaur!

406
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,380
Hi, I'm Bobby Renzobbi!

407
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,250
Are your arms jealous of your legs?

408
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,380
Then you need arm pants--

409
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,350
The pants that you wear on your arms!

410
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,280
Sheesh. Who actually buys this infomercial stuff?

411
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,620
Ha. I know, right?

412
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,250
Cancel the order. Cancel the order!

413
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,290
Snorting. That's his tell.

414
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,230
- I fold. 
- Tough luck, sucker.

415
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,660
- Waddles was bluffing. 
- What?!

416
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,400
I had four aces!

417
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,460
That pig is a wizard!

418
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,470
Look at him. He's taunting me.

419
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,400
I've been cheating the last eight turns.

420
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,300
Ha ha! That's my girl.
