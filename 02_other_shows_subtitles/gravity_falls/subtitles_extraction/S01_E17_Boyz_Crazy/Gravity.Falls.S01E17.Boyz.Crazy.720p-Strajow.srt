1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,400
(imitates Fat Guy) Do you have this T-shirt in my size?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
(imitates Stan) I have something even better! Behold, my butt!

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
(whispering) I could play this game forever.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
What'd you say?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Coughing! <coughs> I was coughing. Those weren't words.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,400
<laughs> This is fun. What you two have.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Mabel! How long have you been standing there?

8
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:30,400
Don't worry about that.Let's talk about why I'm doing this dance! Doo-doo-dooo...

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Oh, no! She got into the smile-dip again.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Wrong one thousand! It's because today is the greatest day of my life!

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Ow!

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,400
'Sev'ral Timez,' is playing at the Gravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet!

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Ugh, Sev'ral Timez? Aren't they that boy band that came a decade too late?

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,034
Oh-oh-oh-Oh! Girl you got me actin' so cray-cray!

15
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,363
You tell me that you won't be my bay-bay!

16
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,400
We're non-threatening!

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Mable, you know all those boy bands are fake, right?

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Dipper's right. They're just a manufactured product of the bloated, corporate music industry.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
You're making my dance sad.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,400
<snorts> There's probably a machine that mass-produces them.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400
<chuckles> Or maybe the boys are grown from pods!

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah, pods, totally!

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
You guys can't ruin this for me. Mable's got backup!

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Hey guys!

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Woot woot!

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Who's ready for the greatest night of our lives? (singing) How many times am I gonna luv ya?

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Sev'ral Timez!

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Ugh, girls.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,309
I know, right?

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm ok!

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,676
Gravity Falls. 1x17.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Hmm. Should I go with lip balm or lip salve?

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Go wild! Tonight's our night!

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I can't wait, guys. Tonight we're gonna meet Creggy G, Greggy C, Leggy P, Chubby Z, and Deep Chris.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
He's the fat one.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
And those boys will fall in love with us!

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Why wouldn't they! <chews>

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
<imitates Robbie> Hey is this the fingerless glove store? I like things that are dumb, I'm Robbie.

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Come on, man.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Laugh it up, chief. (to Wendy) So, hey, Wendy, Nate and his girlfriend are going to Lookout Point this weekend. Maybe we should go, too.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Are you kidding me? First you stand me up last night, and instead of apologizing you want me to go to Lookout Point?

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll just be over here.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Look, Robbie, <sighs> I'm not sure this relationship's working. Maybe I should see other people.

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Yes!

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,750
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey. Before you do anything crazy, I, I, uh, I want you to hear this.

46
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,477
I hope this works.

47
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,563
I wrote this song just for you.

48
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:32,691
When I think about you I feel feelings so deep

49
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,397
I'm tossing and turning And you know I'm losing sleep

50
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:47,434
And I know I'm going crazy When I look into your eyes Just listen to this song And you'll be hypnoti-i-i-ised.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
You know, maybe I was being a little hasty. I'll give you another chance.

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes, all right!

53
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,400
Let me go grab my coat.

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
All right, Robbie, I saw that weird CD. What the heck are you up to?

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
It's called romance, kid. Something you'd never understand.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
You ready? I can't believe you wrote that for me!

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I know, I'm just so insanely talented.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Hmm. ... Hmm?

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
What are you doing?

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Guys, the weirdest thing just happened. I think Robbie might be hypnotizing Wendy with his music.

61
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh, Dipper. Girls just like musicians. You'll understand when you're older.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
We're the same age!

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Girls mature faster than guys. Right, Grenda?

64
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,900
This is Grenda time!

65
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay, girls, have you all practiced your obsessed boy band scream?

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Just gonna ignore that. ... Tickets please!

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Too late girls. The show is sold out!

68
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:03,400
This night is ruined!

69
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:07,400
I welcome you, death.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,400
No! I said we're going to meet Sev'ral Timez tonight and I meant it, and I'm not gonna let a "Keep Out" sign keep us out!

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Stocking meat for the Apocalypse, doodly-doo. We're all gonna die! (normal) What's with the pacing, kid? You look even more freaked out than usual.

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Ah, I don't know. You wouldn't understand.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Aw, come on, kid, try me.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Okay, this is gonna sound weird, but I think Robbie might be brainwashing Wendy with music.

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I've seen this before.

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Really?

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Her name was Carla McKorkle. Carla "Hot Pants" McKorkle.

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,594
Me and Carla-baby would cut a rug together at The Juke Joint.

79
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:53,537
Our favorite fifties themed nineteen seventies diner.

80
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:59,729
Then one day, this new age tree hugger starts playing this transcendental hippie music.

81
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:08,173
Carla's hot pants turned into bell bottoms before I even knew what happened.

82
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,400
My memories get a little hallucinationy at the end, but you get the gist.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
So wait, you actually believe my theory?

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:29,400
You're darn right I do! And we're gonna get to the bottom of it! Right after I get to the bottom of this brown meat! <eating> It's apocalycious!

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
(singing) Sev'ral Timez!

86
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:39,859
(into microphone) Hey, girl, I just wanna get real for a moment and say that while we love being superstars, the real reason we do this, is for you!

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,809
For you specifically. Not the girl sitting next to you! But you!

88
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,400
I love you Deep Chris.

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
He was talking to me!

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Get 'im! Get 'im!

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Thank you, good night!

92
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Hello? Sev'ral Timez?

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
We want to give you several kisses!

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Look!

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:13,890
This is it, girls! You're finally going to meet the five cutest boys in the world. Dipper's gonna eat his words that boy bands are "fake!"

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
This is fun!

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Yo, we're clones, dawg!

98
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400
O.('Oh')

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
M.('My')

100
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
G.('God')

101
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,400
That is one big hamster tube!  Someone's coming!

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Terrible show! What is wrong with you boys? You barely even sold out the arena! And Deep Chris, you call that a pout?

103
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,761
Every one of you should be ashamed of yourselves!

104
00:07:58,762 --> 00:07:59,762
Except for you, Leggy P, you were really on point tonight. Here ya go, gorgeous.

105
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:15,220
As for the rest of you, remember, you can always be replaced by your 'brothers!' Dance for me, child! Dance!

106
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:25,117
My throat is killing me! Can someone get me a lemon and water!

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Who goes there? Prepare to be danced at.

108
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Step off, Deep Chris. She's a lady. Don't disrespect her, bro! Don't disrespect!

109
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
My bad.

110
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Chubby Z, let's calm this boo by posing for her, poster style.

111
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:54,400
Trying hard not to let my brain explode. I've always wanted to meet you guys! But what was the deal with that scary chub-chub man?

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Mr. Bratsman is our producer, yo.

113
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
He genetically engineered us to be the perfect boy band, G.

114
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
But he keeps us in cages! That junk is straight brutal, girl.

115
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
That is straight brutal, Chubby Z.

116
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,422
Our one dream is to escape into the real world, for real. Yo, I heard tell about these things called trees?

117
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,153
I don't know what they are, but I wanna kiss one! But we can't disobey Mr. Bratsman. He says he loves us.

118
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,295
If he loved you, he'd set you free!

119
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,400
Oh, yeah. True dat.

120
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
That's a valid perspective!

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Lets go, right now! Me and my friends can help you escape!

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
We're masters of stealth!

123
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,210
Yo, you'd really do that for us, beef?

124
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:36,400
You can count on me! I'm sorry, did you just call me 'beef?'

125
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:41,426
You see, Dipper, music has subliminal mind-control hidden in it all the time.

126
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:46,268
If you listen closely, even the music I play in the gift shop has subtle hidden messages.

127
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:50,550
Buy more key chains! Buy more key chains!

128
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,885
If you want to hear the mind controlling messages, you gotta slow down the record. Gimme that LP.

129
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Oh. Right.

130
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
We're doing something wrong here but I can't put my finger on it.

131
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Hey, guys. How was the concert? And what's in the bag?

132
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Uh, money! Money we stole!

133
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
We're criminals! We'll cut you!

134
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Let's go away from here now.

135
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Ow! Oof! Ow! Hey! Dang, girl!

136
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Your tour bus is really strange, Mable-girl. Where the feedin' tubes at?

137
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,236
Yo, whatup, girl?

138
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:36,176
So when do we get to go outside?

139
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:39,400
I wanna cavort like a woodland creature.

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
It's your producer!

141
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,957
I can't believe those boys escaped from their cage! You there!

142
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,286
I found this trail of frosted tips leading to this very location! Have you seen any perfect boys around here?

143
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,400
Only when I look in the mirror. Heh heh! Up top!

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,910
They must be around here somewhere. I'll find those boys if I have to turn this town upside down.

145
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,166
Shoo! Shoo!

146
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,718
Good boy.

147
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,400
Guys, it's not safe out there. Ergman's still looking for you .

148
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,400
What do we do!

149
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Ah, dang!

150
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm scared, Mable!

151
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Don't worry, guys, he has to give up eventually. Hey, in the meantime you could stay here with us!

152
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
All right!

153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,258
Twenty thirteen!

154
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:36,400
Girls, do you realize what's happening here? We have our very own pet boy band that we can do whatever we want with!

155
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Remember, eventually we have to let them go. We have to promise not to get too attached to them, right, Mable? Mable?

156
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:50,914
All aboard the braid train! Braid! Braid! What?

157
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,864
(singing) C'mon baby, wont you fly away with me

158
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,065
Take my hand, its destiny

159
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,845
We dont need nobody if we stay together

160
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:02,452
Girl, just take my hand, it can be forever

161
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,864
Up into the sky, girl were gonna fly

162
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:07,692
Look into my big blue eyes

163
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,696
Girl you know its destiny

164
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,216
Take my hand and youre gonna see

165
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,918
Escape, runnin from reality

166
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,171
Itll be this way forever

167
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,404
Just, oh, just a few more minutes.

168
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:21,982
But...

169
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,068
All right, it took all day, but I converted it to a record.

170
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:35,548
And now we can slow it down to see if the mind control message theory is correct! Prepare to have your mind blown.

171
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,164
Spit-take, here I come!

172
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:44,723
(singing) When I think about you (in slow motion) I feel feelings so deep

173
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm tossing and turningAnd you know I'm losin sleepAnd I know I'm going...

174
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,366
Hmm... <swallows> That's not spit-worthy! What gives?

175
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,382
What? Is that it?

176
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,484
(slow motion) ...cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-crazy...

177
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:59,060
This was so stupid! Of course there's no hidden mind control messages.

178
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,971
Mable was right. Wendy just likes the song! She just likes Robbie.

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Hey, Dip. Forgot my keys.

180
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:10,400
What's up, junior. What are you doing, trying to come up with an equation to make girls like you?

181
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,427
Ready to go to Lookout point?

182
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:18,090
Am I! Later, dorks! Catch you on the rewind! <chuckles> I made that up.

183
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,522
I'll rewind your face!

184
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:23,400
Wait a minute! Stan! Rewind!

185
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,424
<indistinct> You are now under my control. Your mind is mine.

186
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,816
Holy mackerel! Now there's your spit-take!

187
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:39,279
I knew it! It's mind control after all! Oh, no! I gotta save Wendy!

188
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:43,340
Finally a good reason to punch a teenager in the face! Let's roll!

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How'd it go up there?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I finally got them to sleep. Poor Greggy C, he tried to eat a tape dispenser.

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think this is food, dawg.

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yo, you gonna share that?

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ah, memories.

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,096
<i>The music industry was shaken today at the news that boy band king, Ergman Bratsman, has been arrested. </i>

195
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,490
<i>He was pulled over tonight for not having a rear license plate.</i>

196
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm telling you! The goat took it!

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's what they all say.

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>He is now in county jail, awaiting trial.</i>

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes!

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We have to tell the boys they are free now!

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go!

202
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Not so fast! They're not going anywhere!

203
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,200
What's the dealio, Mable? That evil producer is gone, we have to tell the boys.

204
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,727
Wait, girls, let's not be so hasty. I mean, think about it.

205
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:47,046
If we don't tell the boys, then they can stay here with me! I mean, with us.

206
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Mable, we can't keep them here forever.

207
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
But I love them!

208
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
If you loved them, you'd set them free.

209
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Never! Every boy I loved this summer has left me, and I'm not gonna let it happen again.

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Candy, we gotta get past Mable. She's gone boy crazy.

211
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,200
Boys!

212
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Mmmm! Candy, attack!

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
You guys! Ergman Bratsman is in jail! You're free!

214
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Just go!

215
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Woah! Is that true, Mable-Dog?

216
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Uh, no, your producer's still out there. You're gonna have to stay here, probably forever!

217
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
What? You can't listen to her!

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Mable's our girl, girl. She puts pizza in our food trough.

219
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
She changes my newspaper, yo! She's a'ight!

220
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
She is not a'ight, Chubby Z!

221
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Sev'ral Timez!

222
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes Mable-Dog?

223
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Remove these two from the premises please.

224
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,983
Oh, no! They're aggressively dancing at us! Mable's gone mad with power!

225
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:50,167
Save yourselves, Sev'ral Timez! You were better off with your producer!

226
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Word!

227
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Call me, Deep Chris!

228
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Twenty thirteen!

229
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Thank you, boys. Now let's get aboard the braid train!

230
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,307
Things just got pretty heavy, Mable. Maybe we should all just, like, chill for a minute and--

231
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,892
(interrupts) I said let's get aboard the braid train!

232
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,600
We gotta warn Wendy about that song before she gets brainwashed!

233
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Road safety laws, prepare to be ignored!

234
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Ha, weird, Nate didnt show up. So I, I guess its just you and me. This isnt what I was planning at all!

235
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Whoa!

236
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Wendy! Stop! Robbie's been lying to you!

237
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Dipper?

238
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Kid! Mr. Pines?

239
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,926
That's Mr. Pines to you!

240
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,600
What? That's what I just said.

241
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Look, Wendy, you've gotta hear this.

242
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Mable, you've gotta hear this. It's a song we wrote to say thank you. Hit it!

243
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh, boy, songs are like hugs that mouths give to ears.

244
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,382
(singing) Here comes yoMable-girl, we dreamed of being free (so free)

245
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:08,095
But now we know that that can never be

246
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,966
You know what friends are all about

247
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,815
You kicked those lying shorties out

248
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm starting to feel guilty here.

249
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,925
(singing) Break it down! Who's the girls who's so a'ight.

250
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,861
(singing) Tucks in to bed at night.

251
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,395
(singing) Holds the fan up while we sing.

252
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:23,915
(singing) Keeps me entertained with string.

253
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,366
(singing) My shirt was wrinkled till...

254
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:26,454
(singing) ...she pressed it.

255
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:26,600
(singing) Chews our food...

256
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
(singing) ...so we can digest it.

257
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
(singing) He was evil, mean and reckless.

258
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
(singing) You gave me this candy necklace.

259
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,093
(singing) 'Sup, girl, other folks we could never trust

260
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:40,134
But we know that you'd never lie to us.

261
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,600
(singing) Mable-girl, we know you love us so

262
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,600
And that's why I've got to let you go.

263
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:51,600
(singing) When I think about youI feel feelings so deepI'm tossing...

264
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Uh, there's a message in there, I swear!

265
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Let me just close the window.

266
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Wait, wait! Here!

267
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,600
You are now under my control. Your mind is mine.

268
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Whoa! Robbie, what's that doing in our song?

269
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Baby, I promise, I don't know anything about those messages. In fact, I didn't even write that song. I ripped it off some other band. So we're all good, right?

270
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,600
No, we're not all good. I don't care about the messages! You said you wrote that song for me. And I actually thought it was sweet, you big liar!

271
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I know, I know. I lie about a lot of stuff. Like using your makeup and fighting a bear, although--

272
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
(interrupts) No. You know what. It's over Robbie. We're through.

273
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
What! Wendy!

274
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Goodbye.

275
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,600
We won! Kid, this is a victory for every guy who's hands are too weak or fat to play a musical instrument!

276
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I couldn't have done it without you, Grunkle Stan!

277
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Ha!

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Um, hey! Uh, now that your night is free, me and Grunkle Stan were thinking, maybe bowling or something.

279
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Are you serious? Right now? What is wrong with guys? You only think about yourselves! All of you should just leave me alone.

280
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh, man!

281
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Look, if it makes you feel any better, the apocalypse is coming soon. Bury your gold! You've been buying gold, right?

282
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
We've got to save the boys.

283
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm prepared to defend myself.

284
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Hi, guys. I'm sorry I went bonkers. A catchy song made me realize that you were right. Can you ever forgive me?

285
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Of course!

286
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Friendship repaired.

287
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
What's goin' on, Mable-girl?

288
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,600
You said you had something you wanted to show us or some deal?

289
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Yep, this!

290
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Yo, dawg, who is this big round bright fool?

291
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
That, Chubby Z., is the sun.

292
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:49,600
That fool's makin' my eyes burn straight painful! I'm gonna stare that fool down!

293
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Yo, yo, hold up. What's this big green mess?

294
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:00,600
That's nature, Deep Chris! Bratsman wont bother you anymore. You can do anything you want to do, go anywhere you want to go. You're free.

295
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Fuh-ree?

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Free! You're free! It means you can skedaddle! Now go! Go! Get outta here before I change my mind!

297
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,600
(singing) Goodbye, girl!

298
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
They won't last a week.

299
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Women! They're the real mystery, Dip. You ruin their date, drive their hippie boyfriend's van into a ravine, and somehow you're the "bad guy".

300
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,600
No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have meddled in Wendy's personal life. She probably hates me now.

Ah, chin up, kid, you were trying to do the right thing. Even though you destroyed a relationship and part of my car.

302
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
You think she'll ever forgive me?

303
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I bet she will, and until then you can always go bowling with me.

304
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Thanks, Grunkle Stan?

305
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Don't mention it, kid.

306
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:55,600
<grunting>

307
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Wait a second. Is something rooting through our trash?

308
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Hey, hey! Get outta here!

309
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,940
Darn beautiful men! Always eating, eating out of my trash. Wait, what?

310
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:19,956
(singing) Girl you got me actin' so cray-cray! (cray-cray)You tell me that you won't be my bay-bay! We're non-threatening, girl. Yeah

311
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:29,721
Dang, girl.

312
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:36,591
Twenty thirteen.
