can stop

Things change.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,328
I have to warn them.

Ah, children.
Come in, come in.

00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,357
Ooh, mysterious
scrolls and potions.

44
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,192
Are you going to tell us
we're finally of age

45
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,094
to go to
wizard school?

46
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,996
Is there an owl
in this bag?

47
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,798
No. I can assure you,
if there's an owl in this bag,

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,967
he's long dead.

49
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,836
Now tell me, children,

50
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,906
- do either of you
recognize this symbol?
- ( both gasp)

51
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,675
- Bill.
- You know him?

52
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,811
Know him? He's been
terrorizing us all summer.

53
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,080
I have so many questions
and theories.

54
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,749
Dipper's been
pretty paranoid

55
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,018
since Bill turned him
into a living sock puppet.

56
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,353
The important thing is,
we defeated him twice.

57
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,756
Once with kittens,
and once with tickles.

58
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,724
It was a lot more heroic
than it sounds.

59
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,760
The fact that you've
dealt with Bill

60
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,827
is gravely serious.

61
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,963
So how do you
know Bill?

62
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:21,400
I have encountered
many dark beings
in my time, Dipper.

63
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,735
What matters is, his powers
are growing stronger,

64
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,237
and if he pulls off
his plans,

65
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,806
- no one in this family
will be safe.
- ( gasps )

66
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,142
Fortunately, there should be
a way to shield us

67
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:33,312
from his mental tricks.
A way to Bill-proof
the shack.

68
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,814
All I have to do is place
moonstones here, here and here,

69
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,716
sprinkle some mercury,
and let's see,

70
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,418
I always forget
the last ingredient.

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,720
Ugh.

72
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,021
Unicorn hair.

73
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,257
That's not, like,
rare, is it?

74
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,858
It's hopeless.

75
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,994
Unicorns reside deep
within an enchanted glade,

76
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,495
and their hairs
can only be obtained

77
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,764
by a pure, good-hearted
person who goes on

78
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,866
a magical quest
to find them.

79
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,168
( screams )

80
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,904
Grunkle Ford, can I please
go on this quest?

81
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,906
I am literally
obsessed with unicorns.

82
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,507
My first word
was unicorn,

83
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,244
I once made my own unicorn
by taping a traffic cone

84
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,779
to a horse's head.

85
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,116
Are you even looking
at the sweater
I'm wearing right now?

86
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,286
Not to mention that
I'm probably the most
pure-of-heart person

87
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,421
in this room.

88
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,257
- That's true.
She has a point.
- Can't argue there.

89
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,425
So can I go on a mission
to get that hair?

90
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,095
Please, please, please.
I'll give you my blood!

91
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,230
Very well,
but it won't be easy.

92
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,933
- Take this, and this.
- Ooh.

93
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,868
I haven't been in
this dimension for a while.

94
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,070
It's okay to give
children weapons, right?

95
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,272
Come on, dawg.

96
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,142
- ( car alarm blares )
- MAN: It's the cops. Gun it!

97
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,544
( tires screeching )

98
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,781
Candy, Grenda, Wendy,
clear the afternoon.

99
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,483
So what are the odds
she gets that hair?

100
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,952
Unlikely. I've dealt with
unicorns before,

101
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,920
and if I had to describe
them in one word,

102
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,789
it would be "frustrating."

103
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,859
- So what are we gonna
do about Bill?
- Follow me.

104
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,141
Welcome to
my private study.

105
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,344
The place where I keep my most
ancient and secret knowledge.

106
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:16,148
Even your Uncle Stan
doesn't know about this place.

107
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,817
Dipper, come along.

108
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,285
If we can't
Bill-proof the shack,

109
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,020
we're gonna have to do
the next best thing.

110
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,524
We're gonna have to
Bill-proof our minds.

111
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,292
( gasps )

112
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,030
It's nice to finally
be out on a mission.

113
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,598
Just us gals.

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Forget the gal talk.

115
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,103
I'm here to meet, touch,
and/or become a unicorn.

116
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,939
I hear, if you lick
a unicorn's neck,

117
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,143
it tastes like your favorite
flavor in the world.

118
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,878
Candy, I will make sure
you lick that unicorn's neck,

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,281
because I care about
my friends.

120
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,516
Honestly, I stopped
believing in unicorns

121
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,285
when I was, like,
five years old.

122
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,053
I'm just coming along
to keep you kids

123
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,988
from walking into
a bear trap.

124
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,459
Stop! This is
the magic part of the forest.

125
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,295
Let's see, the gnome tavern
is over there.

126
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,597
The fairy nail salon
is over there.

127
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,999
It says to summon
the unicorn,

128
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,502
one must bellow
this ancient chant,

129
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,105
droned only by
the deepest-voiced
druids of old.

130
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,906
On it.

131
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,508
( clears throat )

132
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,878
( chanting with
deep voice )

133
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,047
I bet you ten bucks
nothing happens.

134
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,416
- I'll take that bet.
- ( loud rumbling )

135
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,995
( all gasping )

136
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,631
The paintings airbrushed
on the sides of vans were true.

137
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,175
Mother of mothers!

138
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,110
- Dream of dreams!
- No way!

139
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,045
- Eh, eh.
- ( sighs )

140
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,988
Hark. Visitors to
my room of enchantment.

141
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,290
( all gasping )

142
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,026
- ( choking )
- Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.
What's your name?

143
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:13,031
I am Celestabellabethabelle,
last of my kind.

144
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,001
Come in, come in.
Just take off your shoes.

145
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,503
I have a whole thing
about shoes.

146
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,973
Uh-uh, I'm talking to
all of you.

147
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:26,111
Celestabellabethabelle,
we have journeyed far and wide.

148
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,512
About an hour.

149
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,247
On a mission to protect
our family

150
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,482
with your magical hair.

151
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,350
This is your chance, Candy.

152
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,419
Lick the neck.
Lick it.

153
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:38,123
Very well. To receive
a lock of my enchanted hair,

154
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,626
step forth, girl of
pure, perfect heart.

155
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,495
Presenting...
( hums fanfare )

156
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,263
Mabel!

157
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,567
What?! You?

158
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,603
A unicorn can see
deep inside your heart, child.

159
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,104
Ugh.

160
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,074
And you have done wrong.
Wrong, I say.

161
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,744
I guess I do make fun
of Dipper a lot.

162
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,581
And I did just shatter
a window with a crossbow.

163
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:07,352
Your bad deeds
make me cry.

164
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,054
( screams )

165
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,724
Come back when you're
pure of heart.

166
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,060
( whinnies )

167
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,497
The exit is that way.

168
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,066
Shoes, shoes,
take your shoes.

169
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,102
This isn't some... some...
shoe store.

170
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,306
Hey, Mabel, don't
let her get to you.

171
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,009
Yeah, I wouldn't trust
a horse that wears makeup.

172
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,044
No, girls, she's right.

173
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,480
I used to be one of
the sweetest people I knew,

174
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,048
but recently, I've been
slacking

175
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,750
in the whole
goodness department.

176
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,085
Well, today, we're
gonna fix it.

177
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,686
From this moment forth,

178
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,321
I'm gonna do
so many good deeds,

179
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,024
I'll have the purest heart
in Gravity Falls.

180
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,594
That... that bird is fine.

181
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,731
( beeping )

182
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,166
So what is Bill exactly?

183
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,668
No one knows for sure.

184
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,238
Accounts differ of his
true motivations and origins.

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,074
I know he's older
than our galaxy,

186
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,110
and far more twisted.

187
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,079
Not a physical form,
he can only project himself

188
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,582
into our thoughts
through the mindscape.

189
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,551
That's why he wants this.

190
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,619
I dismantled the portal,
but with this tear,

191
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,188
Bill still has a way
into our reality.

192
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,623
To get his hands
on this rift,

193
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,492
he would trick
or possess anyone.

194
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,094
So how do we keep Bill
out of our minds?

195
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,729
There's a number of ways.

196
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,299
I personally had a metal plate
installed in my head.

197
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,200
( chuckles )
Good one.

198
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,136
( clanging )

199
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,270
( coughs )

200
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,638
But this machine is safer.

201
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
It will scan your mind,

202
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,775
bio-electrically
encrypting your thoughts

203
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,276
so Bill can't read them.

204
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,111
Now say hello
to your thoughts.

205
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,546
Oh, man, I can't believe
I'm with the author.

206
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,248
Is my fly down?

207
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,449
♪ Disco girl,
coming through ♪

208
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,184
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy,
Wendy.

209
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,587
You might wanna
ignore that last one.

210
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,256
By the way, you never told me
what your history with Bill was.

211
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,158
Dipper, do you trust me?

212
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,760
- Well, yeah, but...
- Then you'll trust that
that's not important.

213
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,263
Now focus. It's time to
strengthen your mind.

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,135
All right, Mabel, it's time
to strengthen your heart.

215
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,370
♪ Share a smile

216
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,572
♪ Dream a dream

217
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,841
♪ Doin' some good deed

218
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,383
♪

219
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,257
Boom!
1,000 good deeds.

220
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,593
When that unicorn
scans my heart,

221
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,297
she's gonna say I'm absolutely,
100%, bona fide...

222
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,132
Not pure of heart.

223
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,167
Boo-ya! Wait, what?

224
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,702
How is that
even possible?

225
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,538
Mabel's a straight-up
saint, you judgmental hoof bag.

226
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,274
Please tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

227
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,443
Doing good days
to make yourself look better

228
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,312
isn't good at all.

229
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,548
Not to mention you're crushing,
like, ten dandelions right now.

230
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,318
Those are basically
children's dreams.

231
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,254
I'm sorry, Mabel.
It's not my fault
you're a bad person.

232
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,456
( all gasping )

233
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,925
- ( sobbing )
- Mabel, wait. Come back.

234
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,261
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a 3:00 posing

235
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,530
in front of a rainbow.

236
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,266
( whinnies )

237
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,303
Come on, Mabel. Don't beat
yourself up over this.

238
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,873
Let's forget about getting
that dumb unicorn hair.

239
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,275
It's not about the hair
anymore, guys.

240
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,943
It's about me.

241
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,179
Being kind and sweet
is what makes me who I am.

242
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,782
If I'm not a good person,
who am I?

243
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,950
I'm not leaving this spot
until I think of a deed

244
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,453
that makes me as good as
Celestabellabethabelle.

245
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,721
But Mabel...

246
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,556
Just leave me be.

247
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,726
Psst.

248
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,263
Guys, if you ask me,
this whole thing is
a serious load.

249
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,632
Mabel's, like, the best
person I've ever met.

250
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,600
We tried getting
that hair the good way.

251
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,336
Now it's time
we try the Wendy way.

252
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,706
Are you suggesting violence?
Sabotage?

253
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,974
Mabel's not going
to like that.

254
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,243
Mabel doesn't
need to know.

255
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,779
Look, it's time we stopped
trying to be so "perfect,"

256
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,614
and be who we really are.

257
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,517
We're crazed, angry,
sweaty animals.

258
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,952
We're not unicorns.

259
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,454
We're women!

260
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,322
And we take
what we want.

261
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,257
- Yeah!
- Yes!

262
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,728
Too much?

263
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,463
Here's what
we're gonna do.

264
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,364
( whispering )

265
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,872
Get me a flagon of your
daintiest honeysuckle, please.

266
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,608
I'm gonna need
to see some I.D.

267
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,312
The cops.
Hit the deck.

268
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,315
I'm lookin' for someone
who knows how to
take down a unicorn.

269
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,516
No tricks or games.

270
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,319
We are human.
We take what we want.

271
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,287
- Yeah!
- Fairy dust.

272
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,325
A whole magic bag's

273
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,726
enough to put
a unicorn out cold,

274
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,428
but if I
do you a favor,

275
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,730
you gotta do
something for me.

276
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,732
Just spill it, half-pint.

277
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,668
Butterfly trafficking
is illegal in this
part of the forest.

278
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,370
But I like butterflies.

279
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,939
They tickle my face
and make me laugh.

280
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,609
Bring me a bag of butterflies,
and we got a deal.

281
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,289
Two bags of fairy dust,
just like we agreed.

282
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Where do you get this stuff?

283
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,361
Everyone likes sausage,
but no one likes
to know how it's made.

284
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,929
You disgust me.

285
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,931
You've got your poison,
I've got mine.

286
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,299
We made a deal.

287
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,468
Yeah, well,
the deal is off.

288
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,970
Freeze. You're under arrest.
Get down, get down.

289
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,305
These butterflies
aren't mine.

290
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,973
I swear.
I've been framed.

291
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,343
Tell it to the adorable owl
we've dressed as a judge.

292
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,746
My cut.

293
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,314
Good deeds,
good deeds.

294
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,316
Oh, that's not good enough.

295
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,884
Come on, Mabel, you can do
better than that.

296
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,625
Oh, sure, sure.
I wish I could travel,

297
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,427
but it's just not feasible
in this economy.

298
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,062
What the hay?

299
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,570
Sleep now. Sleep.

300
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,344
No, wait!
Stop!

301
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,512
Mabel, sh!

302
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,680
You'll wake her up.

303
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,381
But this is wrong, guys.

304
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,116
But protecting
the shack is good.

305
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,919
What?

306
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,422
Doth my eyes
deceive me?

307
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:21,426
You shall never be
pure of heart.

308
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,561
No, you don't understand.

309
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,998
I just wanna be
good like you.

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,001
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you gotta be kiddin' me.
- Huh?

311
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,403
Yo, C-Beth, are you
seriously pullin'

312
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,440
this "pure of heart"
scam again?

313
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,008
That is
messed up, man.

314
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,810
Wait. Scam?

315
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,045
Kid, unicorns can't
see into your heart.

316
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,449
All our dumb horns can do
is glow, point toward
the nearest rainbow,

317
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,884
and play rave music.

318
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,554
( rave music playing )

319
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,023
Yeah, the whole
"pure of heart" racket

320
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,759
is just a line we use
to get humans to
leave us alone.

321
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,428
Guys, shut up.

322
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,530
All this time.

323
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,500
All this time, I thought
I was a bad person.

324
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,703
- But you're even
worse than I am!
- ( all gasping )

325
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,406
Okay, fine, so you
learned our secret.

326
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,475
We're jerks, okay.

327
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,976
We have more hair
than we know what
to do with,

328
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,411
and we keep it
to ourselves

329
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,812
just to tick
humans off.

330
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,915
What are you gonna
do about it, huh? Huh?

331
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,517
What are you gonna do?

332
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,618
( gasping )

333
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,087
Whoo!
Go, Mabel.

334
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,423
Join the dark side.

335
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,493
Fight, fight, fight!

336
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,796
So it's a fight you want.

337
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,998
Well, then it's
a fight you're gonna get.

338
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,442
Uh, this is taking forever.

339
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,444
How long have I been
doing this for?

340
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,547
( snoring )

341
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,582
Why does he have to be
so mysterious about Bill?

342
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,618
I can handle the truth.

343
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,553
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>Great-uncle Ford is thinking.</i>

344
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,622
<i>Use the machine.</i>
<i>It'll show you his thoughts.</i>

345
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,957
I shouldn't.

346
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,725
<i>He won't know.</i>

347
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,493
<i>He's going to tell you</i>
<i>eventually.</i>

348
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,628
<i>The more you know</i>
<i>about Bill,</i>

349
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,029
<i>the more you can help.</i>

350
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,031
Man, I am really good
at rationalizing.

351
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,566
<i>Yes, you are.</i>
<i>( voice echoing )</i>

352
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,602
Just a little peek.

353
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,738
What are you hiding
about Bill?

354
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,009
( evil laughter )

355
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,877
<i>Where are these ideas</i>
<i>comin' from?</i>

356
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,646
<i>Who are you working with?</i>

357
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,514
<i>My brother's</i>
<i>a dangerous know-it-all.</i>

358
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,516
<i>He would trick or possess</i>
<i>anyone.</i>

359
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,952
<i>Then it's a deal.</i>
<i>From now until the end of time.</i>

360
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,021
<i>Just plug me into</i>
<i>your mind, Stanford.</i>

361
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:33,491
<i>Please, call me</i>
<i>a friend.</i>

362
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,127
<i>( laughter )</i>

363
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,029
Ford and Bill?

364
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,697
( gasps )

365
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,000
You shouldn't
have done that.

366
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,945
Why were you
shaking hands with Bill?

367
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,714
You said Bill could possess
anyone so he could get this.

368
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,049
Careful!

369
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,518
Hand me the rift.
Now, boy.

370
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,186
Why were you really
scanning my thoughts?

371
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,521
Are you Bill right now?

372
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,256
Now just calm down.

373
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,626
Pine Tree. Is that what
you were going to call me?

374
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,294
I was gonna say
please, kid.

375
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,630
Great-uncle Ford told me
to protect the rift.

376
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,832
Get one step closer
and I'll shoot.

377
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,267
I'll erase you right out
of Ford's head.

378
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,935
It's me, Dipper.
It's your uncle.

379
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,771
Trust no one,
trust no one.

380
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,239
- Trust...
- Hand it to me.

381
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,883
Let go of me.

382
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,251
Now just calm down.

383
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,053
Calm down.
Look into my eyes.

384
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,621
Look at my pupils.

385
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,623
It's me, Dipper.
It's me.

386
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,759
I tried to erase your mind.

387
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,594
I'm so sorry.

388
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,897
It's okay, Dipper.

389
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,332
Besides, my mind can't be
erased anyway, remember?
( clanging )

390
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,834
If that really was
Bill, though,

391
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,636
you would've done great.

392
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,738
I should've been
more like you
when I was young.

393
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,707
Dipper, I was a fool
to try to hide all this.

394
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,743
The reason I've been
trying to prepare you

395
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,012
for Bill's tricks
is because Bill tricked me.

396
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,714
It's the biggest
regret of my life.

397
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,249
Bill wasn't always
my enemy, Dipper.

398
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,618
I used to think
he was my friend,

399
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,654
long, long ago.

400
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,322
<i>I had hit a roadblock</i>
<i>in my investigation</i>

401
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,024
<i>of Gravity Falls,</i>

402
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,959
<i>until I found</i>
<i>some mysterious writing</i>

403
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,961
<i>in a cave.</i>

404
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,597
<i>Ancient incantations</i>
<i>about a being with answers.</i>

405
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,666
<i>It warned me</i>
<i>not to read them,</i>

406
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,601
<i>but I was desperate.</i>

407
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,304
<i>I read the inscription</i>
<i>aloud, but nothing happened,</i>

408
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,239
<i>until later that afternoon,</i>

409
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,641
<i>when I had</i>
<i>the most peculiar dream.</i>

410
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,653
Hiya, smart guy.
( voice echoing )

411
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,288
Whoa, don't have
a heart attack.

412
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,756
You're not 92 yet.

413
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,792
Who are you?

414
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,161
Name's Bill,
and your name's
Stanford Pines,

415
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,696
the man who
changed the world.

416
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,965
But I'm getting ahead
of ourselves.

417
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,968
Let's relax. Care
for a game of
interdimensional chess?

418
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,971
Have a cup of tea.
( voice echoing )

419
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,973
<i>He told me</i>
<i>he was a muse,</i>

420
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,809
<i>that he chose one brilliant</i>
<i>mind a century to inspire.</i>

421
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,677
<i>What a fool I was.</i>

422
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,047
<i>Blinded by his flattery</i>
<i>and games.</i>

423
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,983
<i>He became</i>
<i>my research assistant.</i>

424
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,018
<i>He was free to move</i>
<i>in and out of my mind</i>

425
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,787
<i>as he pleased;</i>
<i>we were partners.</i>

426
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,394
When he told me that I could
<i>complete my research</i>

427
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,163
<i>by building a gateway</i>
<i>to other worlds,</i>

428
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,964
<i>I trusted him.</i>

429
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,834
<i>He said this was</i>
<i>the way genius happened--</i>

430
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,235
<i>with a little help</i>
<i>from a friend.</i>

431
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,904
<i>It seemed that I was</i>
<i>on the verge</i>

432
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,772
<i>of my greatest</i>
<i>achievement.</i>

433
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,342
<i>Until my partner</i>
<i>got a glimpse</i>

434
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,810
<i>of Bill's true plans.</i>

435
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,913
Bill, you lied to me!

436
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,315
Where does that portal
really lead?

437
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,852
( laughs )
Looks like Mr. Brainiac
finally got smart.

438
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,854
Let's just say that
when that portal finishes

439
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,756
charging up,
your dimension is gonna learn

440
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,724
how to party,
right, guys?

441
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,860
( echoing laughter )

442
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,162
No. I'll stop you.
I'll shut it down!

443
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,997
A deal's a deal, sixer.

444
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,466
You can't stop the bridge
between our world from coming.

445
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,068
But it would be fun
to watch you try.

446
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,369
Cute even.

447
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,838
<i>I'd been betrayed.</i>

448
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,874
<i>I shut the portal down,</i>

449
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,143
<i>severing the link</i>
<i>between Bill's world and ours.</i>

450
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,011
<i>I had to hide</i>
<i>my instructions</i>

451
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,147
<i>so no one could ever</i>
<i>finish Bill's work.</i>

452
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,016
Bill's been waiting
for the gateway
to reopen ever since.

453
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,019
All he needs to do
is get his hands on
this rift.

454
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,888
To Bill, it's just a game.

455
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,758
But to us, it would mean
the end of our world.

456
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,495
Oh, man.

457
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,798
"Oh, man" indeed.

458
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,468
I'm so embarrassed
about earlier.

459
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,869
I'm such an idiot.

460
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,138
From now on,
no more secrets between us.

461
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,041
We're not the first
two idiots to be
tricked by Bill, boy,

462
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,245
but if we work together,
we could be the last.

463
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,049
But what about Bill?
I broke the machine.

464
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,518
Now we have no way
to protect the shack.

465
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,321
Did someone say
unicorn hair?

466
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,790
Uh, no, actually.

467
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,859
Oh. That would've
been perfect.

468
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,394
Either way, we got
some unicorn hair.

469
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,764
Also some unicorn tears,
unicorn eyelashes.

470
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,199
They finally gave us
this treasure chest

471
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,367
to get rid of us.

472
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,869
It can't be.

473
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,871
This is
a great day, girls.

474
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,840
With this unicorn hair,

475
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,141
we'll be able to
completely shield the shack

476
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,210
from Bill's
mind-reading tricks.

477
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,947
- Is it okay?
- Better than okay.
It's perfect.

478
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,116
You've protected
your family.

479
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,785
You're a good
person, Mabel.

480
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,820
Thanks, Grunkle Ford,

481
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,057
but today I learned that
morality is relative.

482
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,825
Money!

483
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,969
Perfect.

484
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,104
This will protect us
from Bill.

485
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,007
As long as
we're inside,
our minds are safe.

486
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,412
I guess I can't possess
anyone inside the shack,

487
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,947
so I 'll just have to find
my next pawn

488
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,850
on the outside.
