00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,690
Gravity Falls  S01E20  Gideon Rises

2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,890
I just had a horrible dream

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,260
that Gideon stole the deed to the Mystery Shack and kicked us out

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,400
and we all had to move in with Soos's grandma.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,830
That was no dream, dude.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,090
Shh! Por Favovor.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,120
Uh, sorry abuelita.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,080
Oh! Soos, your grandma is so adorable!

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,150
And her skin is old lady soft.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,520
Mabel, quit bebeing creepy! The news is finally on!

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,230
In a move that has all of Gravity Falls buzzing,

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,460
child psychic Gideon Gleeful

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,300
has taken surprise ownership of the Mystery Shack,

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,570
previously belonging to area shyster Stanford Pines.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,570
That picture's taken out of context.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,410
Now that you have the shack,

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,140
What exactly are you planning to do with it?

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,540
I have a big announcement to make today,

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,280
And I'd like to cordially invite

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,110
all the good people of Gravity Falls to join me.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,080
Free admission to everyone who wears their Gideon pins!

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,350
It's my face!

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,350
I just can't believe Gideon beat us!

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,360
Normally I'm able to save the day.

25
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,320
This is all my fault.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,090
Don't worry, Dipper.

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,290
Looks like Mabel's gonna have to be the hero of the family now!

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,430
I'll defeat Gideon with my grappling hook!

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,400
Mabel, no offense, but that grappling hook
has literally never helped us once.

30
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Oh, yeah? Jelly grab!

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,280
I vacuum the walls now.

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,690
So you lost the shack. Look on the bright side, dudes.

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,360
Now you get to live here with me.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,500
Soos!

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,700
Hey, anyone wanna play racecars?

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,530
They're out of batteries but we can make pretend.

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,640
Would it be a new low if I ate that?

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,310
I'm just kidding. I'm totally eating it.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,410
We've gotta get the shack back.

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,320
Hello, Gravity Falls!

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Gideon is the psychic-est!

42
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,330
He guessed the secret ingredient to my coffee omelet!

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,230
Somehow he knew about my horrifying secret birthmark.

44
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,400
I love that child psychic so much!

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
You're choking me!

46
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,170
Grandma, is that you?

47
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,340
We're in.

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,110
Just wanna say, don't know what we're doing here,

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,540
But I am loving these fake moustaches!

50
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,080
If anyone asks, I'm not Soos.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,080
Ladies and gentlemen!

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,060
Today I am delighted to announce my new plans 
for the former mystery shack.

53
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,290
I give you Gideonland!

54
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,330
What?!! Dude!

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,310
We're gonna turn this dirty old shack

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,070
into three square miles of Gideon-tertainment!

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,340
And, introducing our new mascot,

58
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,170
Li'l Gideon junior!

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,340
Boom! He's a pig!

60
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,470
Waddles! You monster!

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,410
All right, that's it!

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,080
Listen up, people! Gideon's a fraud!

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,250
This kid broke in and stole my property!

64
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,420
- Arrest him, officers! 
- Yeah!

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,360
Such accusations!

66
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,360
Mr. Pines, I recall you gave the property to me.

67
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,330
Look, here's the deed right here!

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,330
Well, that's all the proof I need to see.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,470
I love you, Li'l Gideon! Sing them funny songs!

70
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,110
Now get off my property, old man.

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,410
I'll show you who's the old ma--

72
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Ow! Aah! My hearing aid! Aah!

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,510
Thanks for visiting Gideonland, friends!

74
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,350
Don't come back. I don't care for y'all.

75
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,160
Don't worry, guys, we'll get the shack back somehow.

76
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,260
We better.

77
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,360
Wendy!

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,560
If I can't work at the shack,

79
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,260
My dad's gonna force me to work upstate 
at my cousin's logging camp.

80
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,170
What? You're leaving town? But we need you here!

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,570
Yeah, especially dipper, because of his giant crush on...

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,760
You. Calyptus trees!

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,720
The kids loves eucalyptus trees.

84
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,310
Saved it!

85
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,150
Oh, man, guys, don't look now.

86
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,380
Take me back, Wendy!

87
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,320
My arms are too skinny to keep holding this boom box forever!

88
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,190
- I was never here. 
- Have you been getting my texts?

89
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,420
Do I need to send you more texts? Wendy!

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,260
This is not good. I cannot feed such a big family.

91
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,600
Where will we stay, Dipper?

92
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,230
Where will I put all my sweaters?

93
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,270
And what's Stan gonna tell mom and dad?

94
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,370
Ah, Mr. Pines will figure something out. He always does!

95
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,180
Don't worry. Your son and daughter are fine.

96
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,380
Where are we staying?

97
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,480
Uh, I put 'em up at this amazing 4-star hotel!

98
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,420
What? Uh, sure, we got... plenty to eat.

99
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,090
Uh, relax. If I thought I couldn't take care of these kids,

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,030
I'd send 'em back right away. Uh-huh. You, too.

101
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,290
Grunkle Stan, can we order pizza?

102
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
Back to your corner!

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,200
I've been meanin' to ask you, boy.

104
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,040
Shouldn't you be celebratin' Gideonland

105
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,240
instead of sticking your head in that there book all day?

106
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,210
Father, have I ever told you the true nature of this book?

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,180
It was written many years ago by a brilliant unknown author

108
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,110
who learned secrets too powerful for one man.

109
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,220
He hid his journals where he thought no one would ever find 'em.

110
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,020
Because he knew that if the journals were ever brought together,

111
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,860
They would unleash a gateway to unimaginable power!

112
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,790
Codes and maps have led me to believe

113
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,860
The other book's buried somewhere on this very property.

114
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,030
And I intend to find it.

115
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,830
So that's why you wanted the Mystery Shack.

116
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,900
That's right, father.

117
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,100
It's time to begin the search...

118
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,800
For the other journal!

119
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,840
Go, red car!

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Go, other red car!

121
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,750
This would be a lot more fun with batteries.

122
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,750
Kids, we gotta talk.

123
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,820
Look, I've been thinking, and I can't take care of you anymore.

124
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,020
I don't have a house, or-- or a job.

125
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,160
The plan is you're going home.

126
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,860
Your bus leaves tomorrow. Here are your tickets.

127
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,060
But, Grunkle Stan, you can't give up.

128
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, dude. Look at these faces!

129
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,030
Be cuter, Mabel! Your summer depends on it!

130
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,130
Look, I lost, okay?

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,230
The best thing is for you to be with your parents.

132
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,030
I'm sorry, kids. Gideon won.

133
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,230
Summer's over.

134
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,230
Mr. Pines! Come back! Reconsider!

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,140
Mabel, that's enough!

136
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,140
If Stan won't get our home back from Gideon,

137
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,080
Then we'll have to do it ourselves!

138
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,480
Gideon may have the upper hand,

139
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,250
But we have one thing he doesn't.

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,010
- A grappling hook! 
- The journal!

141
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, the journal.

142
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,120
Journal!

143
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,660
All right. The bus to take us out of Gravity Falls

144
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,050
comes at sundown.

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,940
If we wanna stay in town,

146
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,750
we've gotta get past those guards,

147
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,850
Make it through the fence,

148
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,050
And get Gideon to hand over that deed.

149
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,090
Leave that to Mabel! Wa-cha!

150
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Now will you admit the grappling hook is useless?

151
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,860
Nope!

152
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,630
Okay, what can we use to defeat Gideon.

153
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,410
Let's see. Barf fairy?

154
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,900
- Yeah! 
- Nope.

155
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,250
Butternuts squash with a human face and emotions?

156
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,060
- Yeah! 
- Nope..

157
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,570
Whoaoa! What's this?

158
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,280
I've stared at this page for hours.

159
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,080
It seems like a blueprint to build some kind

160
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,350
of strange futuristic super weapon--

161
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,130
Boring! To defeat those guards,

162
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,840
we need some kind of army.

163
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,670
Wait a minute. An army!

164
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,840
Mabel, that's it! The gnomes!

165
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Uh...

166
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,880
I think this is their hiding spot.

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,520
I wonder what gnomes do out here all alone in the forest.

168
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,820
This...this is normal.

169
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,930
This is normal for gnomes. Scrub, scrub.

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,900
Well, well, well! Look who came crawling back!

171
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,590
Take five, Chris.

172
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,770
You guys keep doin' what you're doin'.

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,540
So, changed your mind about marrying me, did you, Mabel?

174
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,360
Ew! Hardly! We need your help.

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,710
And seriously, ew!

176
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,640
You want our help?

177
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,640
After you left me at the altar? No dice!

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,450
Well, what if we were able to get you a new queen?

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,810
One even more beautiful than me!

180
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,450
Her name's Gideon and she has lovely white hair.

181
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,660
Whoa! Mature woman, huh?

182
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,520
Hey, Shmebulock, get my cologne!

183
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,850
Shmebulock!

184
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,420
Is "Shmebulock" all you can say?

185
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,390
Shmebulock.

186
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,490
It's a deal!

187
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,730
Waiter, give me a glass of the strongest,

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,870
most expired apple cider you've got.

189
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,770
Sure thing, Mr. Pines.

190
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,540
Soos? What are you doing here?

191
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,640
Since the Mystery Shack shut down,

192
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,440
I've had to take a bunch of part-time jobs.

193
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,540
Grave digger, bus driver, really awesome cook.

194
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,420
Hey, is the kitchen supposed to

195
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,850
have that much fire in it?

196
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,720
You're a good man-child, Soos,

197
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,450
But it's not looking good.

198
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,550
This whole town loves Gideon and hates me.

199
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,560
If only they knew how evil he really was.

200
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,560
Hey, I'm here for you, dude.

201
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,760
The entire lower half of your body is on fire.

202
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,600
Shh. We're having a moment.

203
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,870
Where are you, journal?

204
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,540
Where are you?

205
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,710
Boy, I hate to interrupt you, but you have some guests.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,810
What?

207
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,740
Give us the deed to the shack, Gideon! Or else!

208
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,780
Am I supposed to say, "Or else what?"

209
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,820
Yes, you are supposed to say that! Now!

210
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,700
You're surrounded by an unstoppable gnome army.

211
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,530
Now give us back our deed and get off our property!

212
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,900
And let the marriage ceremony begin!

213
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,610
Very well. I suppose this deed belongs to--

214
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,610
Ha! What do you know? Works on gnomes, too.

215
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,850
Stop! We'll do anything!

216
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,850
How can we serve you, your majesty?

217
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,520
The most beautiful girl we've ever seen!

218
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,550
I am not a girl!

219
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,190
Really? But your skin is so soft.

220
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,760
You moisturize or...

221
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,630
Subdue them!

222
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,660
I have to admit, kids,

223
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,760
I am impressed by your creativity.

224
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,570
- How did you ever? 
- Let go!

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,670
Oh, no!

226
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,440
No! Could it be? Is it?

227
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,510
Of course!

228
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,770
It all makes sense!

229
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,680
The one place I'd never think to look.

230
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,440
You had it the whole time!

231
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,780
And to think I actually considered you a threat!

232
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,510
No! Give it back!

233
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,520
Every victory you had was because of your precious book!

234
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,920
- Give it back or I'll-- 
- Or you'll what, boy?

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,540
You'll what? Huh? Huh?

236
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,760
No muscles, no brains.

237
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,660
Face it. You're nothing without this!

238
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,730
Bye-bye forever, y'all.

239
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,900
No!

240
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,560
Next time, do your own dirty work!

241
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,440
Come on, boys!

242
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,780
Well, that's it.

243
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,810
Guess the bus should be here soon.

244
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,550
What? Dipper, don't give up!

245
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,620
You always have a plan!

246
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,590
No, the journal always has the plan!

247
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,660
Think about it, Mabel. Gideon was right.

248
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,830
The only courageous or cool things I've ever done

249
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,630
have been because of that journal.

250
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,180
Without it, I can't help you or Stan or anyone.

251
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,520
There's gotta be something we can do.

252
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,960
What can we do?

253
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,380
Bus fifty-two departing Gravity Falls. All aboard.

254
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Sorry, kids. It's for the best.

255
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,370
Can't believe this is happening.

256
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,760
I've got it! I've finally got it!

257
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Get out!

258
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,530
It's finally mine!

259
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,930
At last, I have journal number...

260
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Three?

261
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,570
There are three of 'em?

262
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,500
But where is journal number one?

263
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,470
I must have all three for the power to be unlocked!

264
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,480
But where could I-- Dipper! He must know where it is!

265
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,810
He gave me the third one and kept the first for himself!

266
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,510
I can't let him leave Gravity Falls!

267
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
You there! Is it ready?

268
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,590
Only one way to find out!

269
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,750
I got a good feelin' about that kid!

270
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,560
Well, Stan, this is it. Rock bottom.

271
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,560
No friends, no family,

272
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,890
Stuck watching infomercials for whatever that is.

273
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,190
Are you sick of piles of owls

274
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,860
constantly blocking your driveway?

275
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,670
Well, then you've gotta get owl trowel!

276
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,670
How did you do it, kid?

277
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,770
Why are you always one step ahead?

278
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,870
Maybe he really is psychic after--

279
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,540
Aah! My hearing aid!

280
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,880
What keeps causing that?

281
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,140
Wait a minute. That's it!

282
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,550
I know Gideon's weakness!

283
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,510
Would Mr. Pines like a--

284
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,790
I go vacuum my face.

285
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,600
Hey, Dipper. Wanna play bus seat treasure hunt?

286
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,730
I'm not in the mood.

287
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,830
Oh, come on.

288
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,470
We got Canadian coin,

289
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,570
Gum that's shaped like Ronald Reagan's head.

290
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,640
Ooh! Miscellaneous fluid stain.

291
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,240
- Giant robot! 
- Yeah, giant robot. Wait. What?

292
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,710
- Look! 
- Halt! I command you to halt!

293
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,490
Mr. Bus driver! There's a giant Gideonbot coming towards us!

294
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,620
- Ho hey, dudes! 
- Soos!

295
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,560
Don't worry, guys. I've been a part-time 
bus driver for at least 40 minutes.

296
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,830
One of these things is probably a clutch.

297
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,730
Hang on, dudes!

298
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,800
- Soos! Look out! 
- Aah!

299
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,750
He already won! What does he want from us?

300
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,750
I got you in my sights!

301
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,690
Soos! Cliff!

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,870
Okay, what's closest to our present situation?

303
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,770
"Raccoon in the engine" or "Angry grandparent won't leave bus"?

304
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,440
Probably-- probably the second one.

305
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Tell me! Where is journal number one?

306
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,620
Journal number one?

307
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
Don't play games with me, boy!

308
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,730
I don't know what you're talking about!

309
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,730
You took the only journal I ever had!

310
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,400
What do you even want with these journals, anyway?

311
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,570
Let go of her!

312
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,740
Ha ha ha! You still think you're some kind of hero?

313
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,420
Once I find the final journal, I'll rule this town!

314
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,650
With you as my queen!

315
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,520
Dipper, help me! Help!

316
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,500
Face it, kid. You're nothing without that journal.

317
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,830
How you gonna fight back?

318
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,500
No muscles, no brains.

319
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,800
What are you gonna do? Huh? What are you gonna do?

320
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,550
Let go of my sister!

321
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,590
Never! I finally won this time!

322
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,620
Aah! Aah! Get off! Let go of me!

323
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,470
Huh?

324
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,810
Careful in there!

325
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,520
Dudes! No!

326
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,530
Grappling hook!

327
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,550
Told you it would come in handy.

328
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,520
Mabel, that was amazing!

329
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,490
Not as amazing as you defeating that robot!

330
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,850
Hey, my journal!

331
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,460
- Oh, there it is! 
- Is this the thing that exploded?

332
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,790
What's going on? What is that?

333
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,630
It's over here.

334
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,600
Gideon!

335
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, good heavens! What on earth happened here?

336
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,470
It was the Pines twins. They tried to attack me

337
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,770
and blew up my statue with dynamite!

338
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,410
Arrest 'em!

339
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,810
What? Officers, he's lying!

340
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,710
Sorry, kids, but we trust Gideon,

341
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,850
And nothing short of a miracle could ever change our--

342
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,890
Wait! Wait! Stop everything! I've got something to say!

343
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,660
- Not this guy again. 
- Just wait! Look!

344
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,890
You guys all think Gideon is so perfect and honest.

345
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,730
"Oh, I could never tell a lie! I'm Gideon!"

346
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,830
He's more honest than you!

347
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah! And he's psychic too!

348
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:14,740
How's this for psychic? Bam! Take a good look!

349
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,410
Wait a minute! Is that me?

350
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,840
The secret ingredient to my coffee omelet is coffee!

351
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,580
And me!

352
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,750
I can verify that that birthmark is indeed disgusting.

353
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,550
Hooray!

354
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,790
That's me!

355
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
That's right! These pins are hidden cameras!

356
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,460
And my hearing aid was picking up the feedback!

357
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,690
Who's the fraud now?

358
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,670
Gideon, we gave you our trust.

359
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,670
You lied to us!

360
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,400
Please, I-- it's not what it looks like.

361
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,840
What are you gonna do with me?

362
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,670
Tyler?

363
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,540
Get him.

364
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,850
Get him.

365
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Li'l Gideon, you are under arrest...

366
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,850
For conspiracy, fraud, and breaking our hearts.

367
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,850
Durland, the tiny handcuffs.

368
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,460
Wha-- no!

369
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,790
Just one more thing.

370
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,500
Let go of me! Ow! Ow! Ow!

371
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,500
I believe this belongs to me.

372
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,600
No! No! Watch the hair!

373
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,710
You can't do this to me! Y'all are sheep!

374
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,610
You need me! I'll be back!

375
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,430
You'll hear from my lawyers!

376
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,440
There you have it.

377
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,610
Local hero Stanford Pines has just exposed

378
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,550
Li'l Gideon as a fraud.

379
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,680
Anything you have to say to the town, Stanford?

380
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,920
The Mystery Shack is back, baby!

381
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,770
Oh, thank you, thank you!

382
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,840
Hey, Grunkle Stan!

383
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,610
Uh, you kiddos settling back in okay?

384
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,950
Yep! All of my favorite moldy spots

385
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,920
On the ceiling are still there!

386
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,590
Even you, Daryl!

387
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,760
Hey, Grunkle Stan, me and Mabel have been talking,

388
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,760
And I think there's something we should finally tell you.

389
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,490
This is a journal I found in the woods.

390
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,900
It talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on in Gravity Falls.

391
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,830
Gideon nearly destroyed the whole town trying to find it.

392
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,770
I don't know what it means, or who wrote it,

393
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,670
But after all we've been through,

394
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,710
Maybe you should finally know about it.

395
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,610
I'm glad you showed me this, Dipper.

396
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,780
Now I know where you've been getting it all from!

397
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,680
Spookums and monsters.

398
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,860
This kooky book has been

399
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,850
filling your head with crazy conspiracies!

400
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,750
But it's all real!

401
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,960
You gotta quit readin' this fantasy nonsense for your own good.

402
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,560
Although some of these would make great attractions!

403
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,490
Can't come up with this stuff! Mind if I borrow this?

404
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,700
Wait! No! Grunkle Stan!

405
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,600
"Magic book." Ridiculous!

406
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,640
- Stan, I need it! 
- Dipper, you don't need that book!

407
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,740
Don't you see?

408
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,810
On your own you defeated a giant robot

409
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,810
with nothing but your bare hands!

410
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,610
You're a hero whether you've got that journal or not!

411
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,760
Whoa. Thanks, Mabel.

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,750
I still want it back though.

413
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm sure you'll get it back.

414
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,580
What would a boring old man like Stan want with that book anyway?

415
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,820
Soos'ed!

416
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,430
After all these years.

417
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,730
Finally, I have them all.

418
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,650
It's working!

419
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,390
Here we go.
