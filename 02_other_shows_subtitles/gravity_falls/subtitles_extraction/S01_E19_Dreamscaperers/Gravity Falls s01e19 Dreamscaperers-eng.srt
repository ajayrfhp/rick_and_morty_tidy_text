1
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,150
Gravity Falls  S01E19  Dreamscaperers

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,690
I'm gonna say b-five.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,690
Miss!

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,360
I don't think you're playing this right.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,660
Kids! Come quick!

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,570
I need you to laugh at this with me!

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,340
Who's cute as a button, and always your friend?

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,600
'Lil G-I-D to the E-O-N!

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,670
Wink!

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,470
Lil' Gideon.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,610
Ugh, Gideon.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,710
Remember when I wouldn't date him,

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,510
And he tried to destroy us?

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,380
He's always trying to trick me into losing the Mystery Shack!

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,480
One time, I caught him stealing my moisturizer.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,590
And yet, our mutual hatred for him bonds us together.

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,360
Come on down to

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,390
'Lil Gideon's tent of telepathy.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,390
Opening soon at this location.

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,400
Uh, should we be worried about that?

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,570
Please. The only way Gideon's taking over this shack

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
is by breaking in and stealing my deed.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,670
You mean like right now?

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,370
Uh, thirty-eight?

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,510
Forty-one? Oh, heavens to Betsy!

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,610
Gideon!

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,710
Well, well, Stanford!

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,510
My arch nemesis.

29
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,580
We seem to have entered

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,380
a dangerous game of cat and mouse.

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,680
But the question remains,

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,320
Who is the cat, and who is the--

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,690
Soos, broom.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,460
Oh, no, not the broom!

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,300
You mark my words, Stanford!

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,530
One day I'm gonna get that combination!

37
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,470
And once I steal that deed

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,270
You'll never see the Mystery Shack again!

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,640
Good luck, bucko!

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,480
Ha! The combo to this safe is in the one place

41
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,320
he'll never find it, my brain!

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,560
Your brain isn't as safe as you might think, Stanford Pines!

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,760
This is the last straw.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,370
It's time to unlock the journal's greatest secret.

45
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,200
He put the "old" in old west.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,650
They call him... Grandpa the Kid!

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,390
I'm tired during the day.

48
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,620
I can relate to this.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,520
Grunkle Stan, why can't we watch a movie

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
that we'll all enjoy? Dream Boy High!

51
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,260
Where love is on your permanent record.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Boo!

53
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,400
You'll learn to like it.

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,630
Dudes! There's a bat in the kitchen!

55
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,640
It tried to touch me with its weird little bat fingers.

56
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,340
Don't worry, I got this under control.

57
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,470
Dipper, take care of it.

58
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,410
Yes!

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,250
What? Why can't Mabel do it?

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,310
'Cause life ain't fair.

61
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,380
Now go fight a bat so we can watch tv.

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,450
No way, Grunkle Stan.

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,450
You always make me do dumb chores.

64
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm putting my foot down this time.

65
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,390
I said, do it, kid! Now!

66
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,330
Okay, I'll do it!

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,370
Stupid chores.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,610
Remember, bats are more afraid of you than you are of them.

69
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,580
Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings.

70
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,450
Ducklings. Quack, quack.

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,450
Quack, quack, quack.

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,490
Swabbin' on disinfectant. Doo-do-doo.

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,620
Why does Grunkle Stan always pick on me?

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,360
Think about it, the more painful or difficult the chore is,

75
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,360
The more likely it is I'll have to do it.

76
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,230
Why doesn't he pick on you guys?

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,660
Dipper, Stan's personality is one of life's great mysteries.

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,400
Like whether or not it's possible to lick your own elbow.

79
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,230
- I bet you can't. 
- I bet I can.

80
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,270
Lick it! Lick it!

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,340
Lick it!

82
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,470
Sometimes I feel like Stan hates me.

83
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,340
The sink's clogged!

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,480
Dipper, get in here and fix it!

85
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,290
You think that combination's safe in your mind, Stanford?

86
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,460
We'll see what my new minion has to say about that.

87
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,660
"Triangulum. Entangulum.

88
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,690
"Veneforis dominus ventium.

89
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,700
Veneforis venetisarium!"

90
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,660
Lick that elbow! Lick that elbow!

91
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,170
Like the infinite horizon, it eludes my grasp.

92
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,400
Is that who I think it is?

93
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,270
Oh! Oh! Gravity Falls, it is good to be back!

94
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,670
Name's Bill Cipher.

95
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,270
And I take it you're some kind

96
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,540
of living ventriloquist dummy?

97
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,340
I'm just kidding,

98
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,440
I know who you are, Gideon.

99
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,640
What-- what are you?

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,710
H-- how do you know my name?

101
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,310
Oh, I know lot of things.

102
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,610
Lots of things.

103
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,450
Hey, look what I can do.

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Deer teeth, for you, kid!

105
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,460
You're insane!

106
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,730
Sure, I am! What's your point?

107
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,400
Listen to me, demon!

108
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,530
I have a job for you!

109
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,640
I need you to enter the mind of Stanford Pines

110
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,670
And steal the code to his safe!

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,680
Wait.

112
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,280
Stan Pines.

113
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,320
You know what, kid, you've convinced me.

114
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm sold!

115
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,220
I'll help you with this, and in return,

116
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,650
You can help me with something I've been working on.

117
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,620
We'll work out the details later.

118
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,690
Deal.

119
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,690
Well, time to invade Stan's mind.

120
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,230
This should be fun!

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,230
Remember, reality is an illusion,

122
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,570
The universe is a hologram, buy gold!

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Bye!

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
It worked!

125
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,420
No. Sorry.

126
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,620
What is going on in that guy's head?

127
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,290
Dipper!

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,420
We've gotta help Stan!

129
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,490
Wait, what?

130
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,530
This evil triangle guy

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,390
said he's gonna break into Stan's mind,

132
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,690
And steal the combination to his safe!

133
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,700
Also, we stopped for snacks on the way here.

134
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,430
Triangle guy?

135
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,340
I feel like I've seen something like this before in the journal.

136
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,500
"Beware Bill.

137
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,570
"The most powerful and dangerous creature

138
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,310
"I've ever encountered.

139
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,680
Whatever you do, never let him into your mind."

140
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,680
Grunkle Stan!

141
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,390
"It is possible to follow the demon

142
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,660
"Into a person's mind and prevent his chaos.

143
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,260
One must simply recite this incantation."

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,430
This is just great.

145
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,630
I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan,

146
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,370
And now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?

147
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,500
But if we don't do anything,

148
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,570
Gideon might steal the shack, or worse!

149
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,410
Fine.

150
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,410
Get ready, guys. We're about to journey

151
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,310
into the most horrifying, disturbing place

152
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,650
any of us have ever been.

153
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
Our uncle's mind.

154
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,590
You think I can take these burrito bites into Stan's brain?

155
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,590
Thumbs up, thumbs down?

156
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,180
You know what? I'm just gonna bring them.

157
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,610
Okay, guys.

158
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,630
In order to save our uncle,

159
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,450
we're gonna have to follow that dream demon into his mind.

160
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,340
I wonder what Stan's thinking about right now.

161
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,850
I love Soos like a son.

162
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Soos! This is serious!

163
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
Sowee.

164
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,460
Let's do this!

165
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
"Fidentus omnium.

166
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,540
"Magis omentium.

167
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,770
"Magnesuim adharminum.

168
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,340
"Magnum opus.

169
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,440
"Habeas corpus.

170
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,350
"Inceptus Nolanus overratus.

171
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,750
"Magis tremensium. Magis tremensium.

172
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,620
Magis tremensium!"

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,690
Oh, wow! Whoa!

174
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Oh, what the--

175
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,370
Whoa! This is Stan's mind?

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,470
Huh. Figured there would be a lot more hot old ladies.

177
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,540
Remember, everyone,

178
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,440
We've got to look out for the triangle guy.

179
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,480
Yeah, look out for the triangle guy!

180
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,710
It's him! It's the guy!

181
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,610
You leave our uncle's brain alone,

182
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,500
You isosceles monster!

183
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,320
Gotcha!

184
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,660
Wait. What?

185
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,790
Ah, Stan's family, we meet at last.

186
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,790
Question mark, shooting star, pine tree,

187
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,660
I had a hunch I might bump into you.

188
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,600
Mabel!

189
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
What do you want with our uncle's mind anyway?

190
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,510
Oh, just the code to the old man's safe!

191
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,640
Inside the shack is a maze of a thousand doors

192
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,580
representing your uncle's memories.

193
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,610
Behind one of them is a memory of him inputting the code.

194
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,680
I just need to find it

195
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,680
and Gideon will pay me handsomely!

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,420
Not if we stop you!

197
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,620
Ha! Fat chance!

198
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,550
I'm the master of the mind.

199
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,560
I even know what you're thinking right now.

200
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,620
That's impossible!

201
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,490
No one can guess what I'm thinking!

202
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,830
Whoa! Where are we, bro?

203
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,470
We must be in heaven, 'cause I just saw an angel.

204
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm never letting go of your leg!

205
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,600
You're out of your league, kids.

206
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Turn around now, before you see something you might regret.

207
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,410
Later, suckers!

208
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,510
We're going in.

209
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,610
Mabel, can we leave those guys out here?

210
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,420
Looking at them hurts my eyes.

211
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,780
No! They can help us!

212
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,590
Totally! Arm throne!

213
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,820
Dude, arm throne!

214
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,660
- Arm throne! 
- Ah!

215
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,560
- Whoa! 
- Neato!

216
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,700
- Radical! 
- I also think it's radical!

217
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,570
No refunds! No refunds!

218
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,640
No refunds! No refunds!

219
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,410
Whoa, look! All of Stan's memories.

220
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,680
Great, sure there's plenty of memories

221
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,420
of Stan bossing me around.

222
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,490
Can't wait to see more of that!

223
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,590
Come on, Dipper.

224
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,490
We've gotta find the code before Bill does.

225
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,590
Mabel is talking!

226
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,420
So rad!

227
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,430
Let's get searching!

228
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,700
Jorge, Rico,

229
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,730
You're the two best Colombian prison friends

230
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,850
a fella could make.

231
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,740
Nope.

232
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,670
Sir, would you like to buy a Stan Vac vacuum?

233
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,740
Stan Vac. It sucks more than anything.

234
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,510
Gotta work on that.

235
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,650
Nope.

236
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,390
Whoa! It's Stan on a date!

237
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,660
So, your, uh, your eye is weird.

238
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,590
Let's, let's talk about that.

239
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,400
This is going terrible.

240
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,600
I can't think of anything to say,

241
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,830
And she looks weird up close.

242
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,870
Think of a way out.

243
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,740
Non-specific excuse!

244
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,610
Yeesh!

245
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,410
Look, guys. Memories about me.

246
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,620
That doesn't seem like a good idea.

247
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,620
I just want to know what the old guy really thinks of me.

248
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,720
We already know how Stan feels about us,

249
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,690
He loves us! We're great.

250
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,760
Yeah, let's just keep moving.

251
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,590
More moving? Yes!

252
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,490
I love motion!

253
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,570
Okay, just a quick peek.

254
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,740
Dipper, my back itches, can you scratch it?

255
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,670
Dipper, clean the boiler!

256
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,540
No buts!

257
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,480
Now go chop that firewood already!

258
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,480
Dude, Stan, I been meaning to ask you.

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,420
Why are you so hard on Dipper all the time?

260
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,490
Look, Soos, I'm gonna let you in on something.

261
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,790
You wanna know what I really think?

262
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,460
The kid's a loser. He's weak.

263
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,400
He's an utter embarrassment.

264
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,460
I just want to get rid of him.

265
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,640
Hello, code to Stan's safe, where are you?

266
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,440
Opening and closing doors is fun.

267
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,740
I can do it also!

268
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,620
If only people knew the truth.

269
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,520
That hidden behind this vending machine,

270
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,520
- I secretly have a 
- boring!

271
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
All right, guys,

272
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,360
I have a good feeling about this door.

273
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,690
Hey, mr. Tummy.

274
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,500
Hey, mr. Stan!

275
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,560
Are you hungry?

276
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,360
Yes.

277
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,770
- Eat your crackers! 
- Ugh!

278
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Sweet sally.

279
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,470
Oh, we've been searching forever.

280
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,810
What if the triangle guy finds the memory before we do?

281
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,410
If we wanna find Stan's memory, we gotta think like Stan.

282
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,380
He's always hiding stuff, right?

283
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,780
Yeah, like how he hides his arrest warrants

284
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,480
under that rug in the gift shop?

285
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,780
Soos, that's it! Look!

286
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,760
There ya go.

287
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,470
And now to input the code.

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,770
Thirteen, forty-four, and finally--

289
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,700
Dude, we found it! Yeah!

290
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,440
But what do we do now?

291
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,470
Jinx!

292
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,540
Um, um, let's just destroy the door

293
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
Before bill can find it.

294
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,450
Wait! Maybe I should do it!

295
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,320
My big fat arms are great at destroying stuff.

296
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Oh, okay.

297
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Hey, guys!

298
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,360
I just saw a memory of Stan

299
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,360
roller skating and wearing short-shorts!

300
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,630
Didn't look--didn't look half bad.

301
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,700
Hey, something weird is going on here.

302
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,570
Boy, you kids sure are gullible!

303
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,610
I knew you'd lead me straight to the code!

304
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,090
It's funny how dumb you are.

305
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,060
The combination to Stan's safe!

306
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Boy, that was even easier than I thought.

307
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,290
Oh, yeah?

308
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,500
Well, you're a...

309
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,330
A stink-face!

310
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,300
Awesome comeback, Mabel!

311
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,130
Don't treat me like a child, Xyler.

312
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,100
Later, suckers!

313
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,140
Come on, we've got to save Stan!

314
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,510
What's the point?

315
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,510
Why should I save him, huh?

316
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,340
I work for stan day and night,

317
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,010
And all he does in return is say he wants to get rid of me.

318
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,250
Dipper, I'm sure that's not true.

319
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,420
I saw it with my own eyes in one of his memories, Mabel!

320
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,050
He's always picked on me and now I know why!

321
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,220
Stan hates me!

322
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,460
Dipper, it doesn't matter what you saw.

323
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,660
If we don't stop Bill, we'll lose the shack!

324
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,730
No, you know what? Not this time.

325
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,630
For once, this is one of Stan's problems I'm not gonna fix.

326
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,540
Fine! Come on, Soos.

327
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,570
We'll save Stan ourselves!

328
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,670
Dipper, you're a cool dude, but this isn't cool, dude.

329
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,410
Let's go, Xyler!

330
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,680
All right, Craz!

331
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,280
Those are our names!

332
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,520
- Yello? 
- Bill!

333
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,590
Did you find the memory with the combination yet?

334
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,290
Relax, shortstack, I got it right here.

335
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,590
Perfect!

336
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,630
Now give it to me

337
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,500
And I'll fulfill my end of the bargain.

338
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,570
Finally! It's-- you got a pen there?

339
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,570
It's thirteen, forty-four--

340
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,710
Ah! No, no, wait! No!

341
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,640
None more bottomless than the bottomless pit.

342
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,310
Which, as you can see here, is bottomless.

343
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,610
Whoo! Whatever that was, it's gone forever.

344
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,280
Ha ha! Boom!

345
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,380
Mabel did it!

346
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
The shack is safe!

347
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,420
The deal's off!

348
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,490
Wait. No! Wait!

349
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm switching to plan b!

350
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,560
You!

351
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
You can't even imagine what you just cost me!

352
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,300
Do you have any idea what I'm like

353
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,470
when I'm mad?

354
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,350
So I guess he gets really mad when he gets mad.

355
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,520
Eat nightmares!

356
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,490
How do I get out of this place?

357
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,430
Exit? Hello?

358
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,560
Ah, this again?

359
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
He's a loser. He's weak.

360
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,700
I just want to get rid of him.

361
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,310
Yeah, those are all things people said about me when I was a boy.

362
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,310
Huh?

363
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,510
It was terrible.

364
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,480
I was the biggest wimp on the playground.

365
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,320
So one summer my pop signs me up for boxing lessons.

366
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,320
And it was even worse than the schoolyard!

367
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,620
Left hook!

368
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,630
You know, at the time, I thought my pop was trying to torture me.

369
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,260
But wouldn't you know it?

370
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,270
The old man was doin' me a favor all along.

371
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,270
Give me that bag!

372
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,330
Help! My purse!

373
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,640
- Help! 
- Left hook!

374
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,480
So you see?

375
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,510
That's why I'm hard on Dipper.

376
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,610
To toughen him up,

377
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,650
So when the world fights, he fights back.

378
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,750
Do you think it's actually working?

379
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,690
I, I did it!

380
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Yes!

381
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,420
He's really comin' along.

382
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,430
When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him.

383
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,330
Just don't ever tell him that.

384
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,630
His head's big enough as it is.

385
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,460
That's true.

386
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,370
Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here?

387
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
Nice hole in your chest, by the way.

388
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,340
Let's fix that up.

389
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,340
W-- what the-- how did you do that?

390
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,550
Word to the wise, kid, we're in the mind.

391
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,610
You could do whatever you can imagine in here.

392
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,550
Well, how about that.

393
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,420
No! Make it stop!

394
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
Help! Someone, please!

395
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,620
Oh, my gosh, what am I doing?

396
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,730
I gotta stop Bill!

397
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,430
Huh. Fightin' back.

398
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,530
One nightmare, coming up!

399
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,600
Nightmare?

400
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,400
Hope he doesn't mean that British dog-man

401
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm always dreaming about.

402
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,610
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,570
Who's crike for a shdig in the pudding?

404
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,340
Ah! It's everything I ever feared!

405
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,340
You!

406
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,480
Ahh! My cuteness!

407
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,520
What did you do to my cuteness--

408
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,390
You're next!

409
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,690
Cool, we're next!

410
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,600
My dream boys!

411
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,570
And now to finish you off, for once and for all!

412
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,240
No! No!

413
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,300
Dude, no!

414
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,440
Hey, Bill!

415
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,570
What!

416
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,270
Nice bowtie!

417
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,380
- Dipper! 
- Dude!

418
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,350
Guys! I just learned that you can conjure

419
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,520
whatever you can conceive in Grunkle Stan's mindscape!

420
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,250
Huh?

421
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,590
Just think of cool fighting stuff and it'll happen!

422
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
Like this.

423
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,390
He's dead now.

424
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,460
What? Who told you that?

425
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,460
Don't listen to him!

426
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,330
We can do anything?

427
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,300
Like have kittens for fists?

428
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,370
Well, hello, friends!

429
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,440
Anything, huh?

430
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Soos loves stomach beam stare!

431
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,350
Enough games!

432
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Hamster ball shields, activate!

433
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Activate!

434
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,290
Ah, my eye!

435
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,600
Rise, Xyler! Rise, Craz!

436
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,770
No! Synthesized music!

437
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,410
It hurts!

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,540
And now to imagine your worst nightmare!

439
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,610
A portal out of Stan's mind!

440
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,680
Out of Stan's mind!

441
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,550
Mabel! Everyone!

442
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,680
Together!

443
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,690
No, no, no!

444
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Enough!

445
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,830
You know, I'm impressed with you guys.

446
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,560
You're a lot more clever than you look.

447
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,360
Especially the fat one.

448
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,630
He's talking about you.

449
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,470
So I'm gonna let you kids off the hook.

450
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,770
You might come in handy later.

451
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,540
But know this.

452
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,700
A darkness approaches,

453
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,370
A day will come in the future

454
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,610
when everything you care about will change.

455
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,580
Until then, I'll be watching you.

456
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,580
I'll be watching you.

457
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,520
He's gone, we did it!

458
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,520
Wha--

459
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,690
Stan must be waking up.

460
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,760
Will I ever see you guys again?

461
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,430
In your dreams.

462
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,660
Good one, bro. Good one.

463
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,530
We did it!

464
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,670
What? Did what?

465
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,570
What are you all doing here?

466
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
And why was I dreaming of

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,410
two brightly colored and radical young men?

468
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,710
Grunkle Stan! You're okay!

469
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,780
What is this, a hug?

470
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,310
Nope.

471
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,310
It's a choke hold.

472
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,790
Not bad, kid. Not bad.

473
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,390
I'm just glad Gideon didn't get into the safe.

474
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,490
I really love this old shack.

475
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,360
Group hug!

476
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,430
No?

477
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
I never know the right time!

478
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,660
Hey, do you guys feel a--

479
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh, I'm sorry, Pines family, did I wake you?

480
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,640
But we defeated Bill.

481
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,270
Bill failed me!

482
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,380
So I switched to plan b.

483
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,410
Dynamite.

484
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,510
What? Bill?

485
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,750
Who-- wh-- what are you guys talking about?

486
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,710
Spoiler alert, Stanford. I've got the deed!

487
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,450
The mystery shack belongs to me!

488
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,690
So, get off my property!

489
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,420
Daddy?

490
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,660
Bring it around the front.

491
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,690
Don't worry, guys.

492
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,360
It's just part of the dream.

493
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,300
We're going to wake up any second now.

494
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,430
Right? Right?

495
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,610
Someone, pinch me, dude.
