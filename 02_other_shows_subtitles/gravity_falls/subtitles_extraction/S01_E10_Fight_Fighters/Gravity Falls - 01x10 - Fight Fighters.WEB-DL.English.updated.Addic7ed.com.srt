1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,990
This is it, dudes:
my favourite place in Gravity Falls

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,930
Everything I know I learned right here

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,620
A frog told me how to cross a street

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,190
When my house was haunted,

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,510
I learned how to eat ghosts

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,680
And this thing taught me how to dance

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,320
I've been jigging for 7 days straight!

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,900
Soos?..

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,110
Let him have this

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,450
Congratulations!

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,900
You win!

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Oh! Watch out!

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,660
Ooh, cutscene

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,820
Dr. Karate, you killed my father

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,320
Dr. Karate, you killed my father again!

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,740
You take that baaack!

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,420
Fight!

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,980
Yeah yeah yeah! Go go!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,880
Our winner Rumble McSkirmish

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,640
Winners don't lose!

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,100
What? You cheated

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,880
You'll take that baaack!

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Round 2

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm gonna punch them rough

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,150
Fight!

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,170
Let's gang up on them

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,410
Wendy! What's up babe?

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,690
Just putting up some flyers for my band

29
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm leading guitar. No biggie

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,310
Are you wearing mascara?

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,900
Um, it's eye-paint for men

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,780
Robbie, Dipper was just showing me this great game

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,920
Ah, yeah, sweet, sweet

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,540
How's about you sit this one out, kid champ?

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,240
But... We just started this round

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,480
Hey, relax, man

37
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm just trying to spend a little time
with my girlfriend, all right?

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,420
It'll just be one round

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,150
Round 3. Fight!

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,860
I'm going camping tomorrow with my dad,
so I won't be around

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,450
Ah, cool, cool. Watch out!

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
King me!

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,250
It's not fair!

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,840
She doesn't even know what we're playing!

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,190
Go fish?

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,620
Dude. I think I'm picking up
a radio station inside my head

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,540
Try blinking to see if you can change the channel

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,090
We-endy-y!..

51
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,570
Sounds like Robbie

52
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,570
Robbie?

53
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,000
Is he that jerky twerp I see making
goo-goo eyes at Wendy all the time?

54
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,010
He called me big dude once. I mean,

55
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,980
I am a big dude, but it kinda hurt

56
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,300
Should I sick Waddles on him again?

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,610
Easy, tiger!

58
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll handle it

59
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,420
O-o-oh!

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,820
Ha-ha, conflict

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,070
Wendy, Wendy-Wendy, Wendy!

62
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,160
Come on out, girl! Come on down!

63
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,940
You realize she's not here, right?

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,430
Pssh. Yes.

65
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,050
What?

66
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,140
She's out camping with her family today

67
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,700
Maybe if you listened to her for once, you'd know that

68
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,050
What was that?

69
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,450
I just said she's not here

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
No-no-no. You wanna get into it, huh?

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,200
Who wants get into it, kid?

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,770
You think I don't know what's been going on, huh?

73
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,000
It's obvious, you've gotta thing for my girlfriend,

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,430
Don't you? Don't you?

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,550
What? No! Come on, man!

76
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,890
Yeah. I'm sure she's just dying to ask out 12 year old kid

77
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,890
who wears the exact same shorts every day

78
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,310
Hey, here's an idea.

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,300
Why don't I call her right now and see
if she wants to go out on a date with you

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,480
Hey! Look! Don't... You don't have to!

81
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,970
Don't, please, man!..

82
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,920
What are you gonna do, huh?

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,710
What? What? (Hello?)

84
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,580
My phone!

85
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,190
I'll buy you a new one

86
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,810
Oh no. You're not getting off that easy!

87
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,160
Hey, I know a fight when I see one

88
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,170
Stay right there!

89
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,990
You, me, Circle Park, 3 o'clock

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,150
We finish this!

91
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,080
Oh, he's gone

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,700
I was just gonna call the boys over to place a few bets

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,900
The smart money's on skinny jeans

94
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,790
What was I thinking? I can't fight!

95
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,370
I've never been in a fight before

96
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,970
Look at these noodle arms!

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Just bonk him over the head

98
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,080
It's nature's snooze button

99
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:47,980
Boys!

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,580
Why can't you learn to hate each other in secret?

101
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,040
Like girls do

102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,670
Sure, listen to your sister

103
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,390
Maybe you can share dresses too

104
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,120
Ha-ha-ha Boom!

105
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,640
Maybe he'll just forget about it?

106
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,400
Maybe it'll all blow over

107
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,540
I don't know Dipper. Teenagers are dangerous

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,200
Those hormones turn them into killing machines

109
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,300
Really?

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,990
Oh yeah dude. My cousin Reggie got in a fight with teen once

111
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,050
The guy broke like...

112
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,910
All his arms... All his legs...

113
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,540
I think he killed him or something, I don't know

114
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,230
Me and Reggie were just talking about it

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,570
I can't stay here. What if Robbie comes back?

116
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,670
I gotta hide!

117
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,620
Look kid. You've got yourself a choice here

118
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,660
You could either go face him like a man

119
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,580
or you can hide indoors, like a wimp

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,770
What will it be?

121
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,900
Wimp it is

122
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,830
Come on, Soos. Robbie is twice my size!

123
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,280
I mean, what would getting myself killed accomplish?

124
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,720
I just need to hide here until 3 o'clock passes

125
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,730
This day will never end

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,230
Relax, Dipper. Just try not to think about Robbie

127
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,600
Girl, why you ackin' so cray-cray?

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,720
"Why you ackin' so cray-cray" will be back in a moment

129
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,920
Poor Dipper

130
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,420
Hiding from Robbie, unable to face his fears

131
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,010
Fears are for chumps. That's why I don't have any

132
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,010
You want me to go get a ladder?

133
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,750
— We don't have one
— What?

134
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,500
You know, study shows that keeping a ladder inside the house

135
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,130
is more dangerous than a loaded gun

136
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,940
That's why I own ten guns:

137
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,800
in case some maniac tries to sneak in a ladder

138
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,520
Grunkle Stan! Why you ackin' so cray-cray?

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,340
You're the one who's ackin' cray-cray!

140
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,850
I gotta go now

141
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,020
Why would Grunkle Stan be so weirded out by ladders?

142
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,040
Of course!

143
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,250
I think he has a secret fear of heights!

144
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,640
We'll have to test him to be sure

145
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,430
Or we could leave well enough alone

146
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,550
Na-a-ah!

147
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,700
I wonder what it's gonna be like
to go inside a video game for real

148
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,740
I should have thought of this years ago!

149
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,140
Stupid Robbie, such a jerk

150
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,110
Round 4. Fight!

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,040
K.O.

152
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,890
Continue?

153
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,270
A winner never runs away from a fight!

154
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,460
That's easy for you to say

155
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,750
You have more than one life!

156
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,330
I wish one of these guys could fight Robbie for me

157
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,350
"To unleash ultimate power?"

158
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,320
I do like things that are ultimate

159
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,350
Back, back, hold, forward, back, forward,
down, hold, quarter, circle forward, triple punch!

160
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,090
I guess it didn't work

161
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,250
Uh... Soos?

162
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,890
Select your character!

163
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,440
Uh... Rumble McSkirmish?

164
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,100
You're real?

165
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,960
High five!

166
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,400
Ow! Your pixels are really sharp!

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,650
Greetings child boy!

168
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,860
I'm Rumble McSkirmish from a USA!

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,880
Punch Kick Punch Kick!

170
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,870
Ow! Cool!

171
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,630
Change machine! Change me into a powerful wolf!

172
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,990
With Rumble around Robbie will be so scared
I won't even need to fight him

173
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,480
I've got the world's greatest fighter to be my bodyguard!

174
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,000
I need power-ups!

175
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,230
This is so amazing! I've got to show Soos!

176
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,270
Soos?

177
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,350
Help! I'm trapped in a game!

178
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,370
It was cool in theory but in practice it was really boring

179
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,940
It's not just a game anymore

180
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,770
Alright Waddles. It's time to begin

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,670
Operation Get Stan Over His Fear Of Heights!

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,340
I came up with that name

183
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,830
Happy Great Uncle's Day!

184
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,400
There's a Great Uncle's Day?

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,240
Of course it's not a day I've made up

186
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,840
High heels! You shouldn't have

187
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,680
Seriously. What... What is this?

188
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,750
What's wrong?

189
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,420
Are you saying these heels are too high?

190
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,680
Do they make you uncomfortable?

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
— Maybe
— Admit it! Admit you have a fear of heights!

192
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,490
What? That's why you bought me these?

193
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,550
You should be ashamed of youself!

194
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,870
And on Great Uncle's Day no less!

195
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,660
But no, I don't have a fear of heights

196
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,050
We now return to world's most terrifying skydiving!

197
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,090
Ah! Ah! Ah! Turn if off!

198
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,700
So I have a fear of heights

199
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,770
Is that really so cray-cray?

200
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,100
We don't have any traditional power-ups

201
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,570
Turkey legs, pizza boxes or golden rings

202
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,720
How about half a taco?

203
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,120
Place it on the floor

204
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,190
I wish I could do that!

205
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
Now I must defeat the world's greatest fight fighters!

206
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,540
Take me to the Soviet Union!

207
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,220
That's gonna be tough. For a number of reasons

208
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,620
But I do know a fighter here in Gravity Falls

209
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,010
Maximum power?

210
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,880
His name is Robbie V. and he's kinda my archenemy

211
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,670
Did he kill your father?

212
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,470
Well, he's dating the girl I like

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,390
and he posts a really annoying amount of status updates

214
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,550
And then he killed your father!

215
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,490
Uh, sure

216
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,520
Anyway, I was hoping you could scare him off for me,

217
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
so I don't have to fight the guy?

218
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,670
Ha-ha-ha! Your question makes my shoulders bounce!

219
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,710
Fireball! Uppercut! Downercut! Bowl of punch!

220
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,920
So you'll protect me from Robbie?

221
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,890
Challenge accepted! Press Start!

222
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,650
Oh-oh. I think I hear my uncle

223
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,540
Stay perfectly still

224
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,110
I said stay still

225
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,010
This is as still as I can stay

226
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,340
How I'm gonna get Grunkle Stan over his fear of heights?

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,650
Hey Mable. Have you met Rumble yet?

228
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,780
He's my new bodyguard

229
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,630
The child gave me a taco!

230
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,540
Wow! He's got a crazy voice!

231
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,310
Here, say these words

232
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,730
Effervescent!

233
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,270
Applefritter!

234
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,160
Riboflavin!

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,860
Mabel, he's not a toy, he's a fighting machine

236
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,540
I'm gonna get him to defend me from Robbie

237
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,430
Isn't that kinda like cheating?

238
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,370
I guess so

239
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,490
Well, I'll see you after the fight

240
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,350
Poop! Poppenbuts!

241
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Tell me my opponent's special moves

242
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,810
Don't worry. As soon as he sees you,
he's gonna wet his pants

243
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,390
His wet pants will be no match for this!

244
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,770
Woah! Where did that come from?

245
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,200
I punched an oil drum!

246
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,130
Trust me, you won't need that. Just give him a good scare

247
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,090
Yes!

248
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,830
With this!

249
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,390
This street has really dangerous litter

250
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,160
Hey Grunkle Stan!

251
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,680
How would you like to go take a walk

252
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,000
nowhere in particular while wearing a blindfold?

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,500
Huh! Beats just sitting around being old

254
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,390
Wait a minute!

255
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,510
You're not planning on taking me
somewhere super high up, are you?

256
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,580
Grunkle Stan! I would never!

257
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,890
Scout's honour!

258
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,530
All right. Let's go

259
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,410
Hee-hee-hee

260
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,030
Well-well-well, look who decided to show up

261
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,450
I thought you chickened out

262
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,410
You ready to settle this like men?

263
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,800
Look dude, I don't think you wanna fight me

264
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
Let's just call this thing off before someone gets hurt

265
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,950
You're scared, huh? Is that it?

266
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,070
Ok dude. You asked for it

267
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,120
Who's your friend? And why is he blurry?

268
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,090
This happens to be the greatest warrior that ever lived

269
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,470
Yeah, right. Hey eyepatch, what have the kid promised you

270
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,260
more tate for your forearms?

271
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,460
How can you laugh when you killed this boy's father?!

272
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,210
Wait, what?

273
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm giving you one last chance: back down,

274
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,060
or this guy is gonna go nuts

275
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,860
How about you back down, kid!

276
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,050
You asked for it. Rumble, go!

277
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,310
What the?..

278
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,560
Wha... What is happening?

279
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,510
I didn't want to do this, man, but you gave me no choice

280
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,220
Maybe now you won't mess with me

281
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,930
Woah! Rumble, you can stop! I think Robbie's had enough!

282
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
Rumble Throw!

283
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,800
Stop! I said stop!

284
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
What the? That guy is crazy!

285
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,520
Fireball!

286
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,080
What the heck was that?

287
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,870
You're only supposed to scare him, you almost killed him!

288
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,350
I will not rest until the man who dishonoured you

289
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,250
is DESTROYED!

290
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,230
Punch!

291
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,050
This isn't good

292
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,050
Something told me this would be his first stop

293
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,830
Chill out man!

294
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,290
Please, Rumble, you gotta stop!

295
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Rumble, wait!

296
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,270
Punch-punch-punch!

297
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,330
You don't have to do this

298
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,670
At least pace yourself

299
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,840
You might get a cramp

300
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,990
I love you dad!

301
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,210
Oh! My car!

302
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,690
We'll just buy another one

303
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,520
I love being rich

304
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,820
All you can hit!

305
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,560
Hi dude!

306
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,220
Soos! Where have you been?

307
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,700
Long story, man.

308
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,430
Dude, did you see that video game guy
destroying everything in sight?

309
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,010
That's crazy!

310
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,060
Yeah, I kinda sorta brought him to life to be my bodyguard

311
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,740
But now I have to stop him before he kills Robbie!

312
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,450
You need an amiable sidekick with a pickup truck?

313
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,110
You know I do!

314
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,800
Take off your blindfold NOW!

315
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,990
Yeah, that's pretty much what I was expecting

316
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,050
You're doing better than I thought!

317
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,830
Now look over the handrail

318
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,460
Nope

319
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,490
Hey, do you smell anger and hormones?

320
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,540
Finally, I'm safe

321
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,410
Hey, Robbie, get your own water tower!

322
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,670
Shh, keep it down, he'll find us!

323
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,100
Challenger sighted!

324
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,730
On to save the day, dude

325
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,910
You can hide, but you cannot hide!

326
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,060
Rumble, this has to stop, please, listen to me!

327
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,650
Kick!

328
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,000
What was that?

329
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,880
Oh boy

330
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,500
We're safe, right?

331
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,430
Of course not! This thing is on stills!

332
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,550
High, high up!

333
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,430
Punch!

334
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,270
Finish him!

335
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,580
No no no! Don't! Don't finish me!

336
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,230
Rumble!

337
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,220
Rumble, I have something to tell you

338
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,330
Robbie...

339
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,710
Robbie didn't kill my father

340
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,530
Then who did?

341
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,170
What?

342
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,410
No one did, I lied to you

343
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,540
Then you're actually a...

344
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,390
bad guy!

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
I guess I kinda am...

346
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,490
My entire journey —

347
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,830
A lie. My honour has been insulted

348
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,350
Sensei warned me not to join the path of evil

349
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,790
The boy has led me astray from my teachings

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,330
If Robbie V. is not the last stage,

351
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,660
then it must be...

352
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,960
YOOOUUUUUUUUUUU!

353
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,660
Dude!

354
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,450
Don't fight him, man

355
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,180
That guy's got like the black belt
wrapped around his black belt

356
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,170
You could get killed

357
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,000
I have to

358
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,180
I started all this, and I've got to at least try to stop it

359
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,230
You're sure you wouldn't rather hide like a wimp?

360
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,000
Fight like a man it is

361
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,980
Ready!

362
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,760
Fight!

363
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,910
Fireball and lightning ball through

364
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,670
Fire!

365
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,100
Ha ha ha! You fight like a girl!

366
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,490
Who was also a baby!

367
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,840
Oh no

368
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
That was worth a shot

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,720
No. I have no looking up

370
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,680
...animation!

371
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,310
What should I do? Roll him up and put him on my wall?

372
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,270
Dude! We should rock paper scissors for him

373
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,740

374

375
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,500
FIST PUNCH RAIN!!!

376
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,460

I wouldn't be too sure about that, man

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,070
Game Over!

Noooooooo!

399
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,790
Game over, old friend

400
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,290
Ha-ha, nice one, dude

401
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,950
I'm sorry, Grunkle Stan

402
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,040
I thought this would help but I was wrong

403
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,590
So wrong!

404
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,540
I... I survived!

405
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,890
I survived and I feel great!

406
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,720
Wait. Let me do a cocky dance just to be sure

407
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,360
Ha-ha! Deal with it, world!

408
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,060
Stan Pines is cured of his fear of heights!

409
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,230
— You're coming kid?
— Uh-huh

410
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,750
What's the matter? You've got a fear of heights now?

411
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,090
Oh-oh

412
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,590
What? Who was that guy?

413
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
Why is it that whenever you're around,

414
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,670
there's always ghosts and monsters and whatever?!

415
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,890
I don't know, man

416
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,780
That guy almost broke my neck.
You know how mad I am right now?

417
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,640
So I guess you and I have to fight now, huh

418
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,190
Go ahead, man. Do your worst.

419
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,730
I just wanna get this over with

420
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,910
Oh man, I'm so gonna enjoy this

421
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,710
— Aren't you gonna run?
— Nope

422
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,580
Are you sure?

423
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,240
Pfft. It's not ever worth it

424
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,720
Playing lead guitar, so I'm gonna save my hands

425
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,380
Hey guys, I heard some crazy screaming out here

426
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,820
— Wendy?!
— Wendy?! You're back!

427
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,670
Yeah, man. Oh. What the heck happened here?

428
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,250
Freak tornado or something?

429
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,100
Uhh... Well...

430
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,910
And why are your faces all jacked up?

431
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,810
You guys weren't fighting each other, were you?

432
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,360
I hate it when guys fight

433
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,710
No, fighting? No, why would we? Never!

434
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,060
We actually fell down trying to stop
two other guys from fighting each other

435
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,980
Cool. Really makes me happy to see my two boys hanging out

436
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,560
I've got some unpacking to do

437
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,630
I'll text you guys later

438
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,730
Did you hear that? She called my one of her two boys!

439
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,450
She was looking at me though

440
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,630
Look, Robbie. If we stay at each other's
throats, we'll both lose Wendy

441
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,710
We need to make a cold war pact

442
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,710
Ok. What's that?

443
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,290
We need to learn to just hate each other in silence

444
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,490
You mean, like...

445
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,140
What girls do?

446
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,680
Yeah, exactly. What girls do

447
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,570
So then I told Thompson:

448
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,690
"Hey! Save some for the rest of us!"

449
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,950
Good one, Wendy!

450
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,630
Oh, man. Just a second

451
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,540
So as I was saying

452
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,850
Yeah, I know, you're the best!

453
