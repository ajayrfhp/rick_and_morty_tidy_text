1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,172
La La La La La La La-- Ahh!

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,607
( screams )

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,943
Braces, braces
caught in the screen door!

4
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,544
Someone dictate my will!

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,113
I'm giving it all to Waddles!

6
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,247
Say "ah," girl-dude.

7
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,049
Ahh-uh!

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,119
Soos!
You saved me!

9
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,554
Just doing my job,
hambone!

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,123
I'll see you dudes
tomorrow!

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,224
Bye, Soos!

12
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,191
Night, Soos!

13
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,593
Night, Soos!

14
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,961
Doo doo doo...

15
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,096
Walking to my car...

16
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,798
You ever wonder
what Soos does

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,266
when he's not here
at the Mystery Shack?

18
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,601
No.
Not really.

19
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:36,769
Not once ever.

20
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,973
Punch!

21
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,974
Punch those leopards.

22
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,008
( bell chiming )

23
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,543
Ooh, highlights are done!

24
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,978
You are gonna make
the other grandmas

25
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,714
at the bingo hall
so jealous.

26
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,982
Just a minute,  <i>mijo.</i>

27
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,617
Look at this.

28
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,318
Your cousin Reggie
is having an engagement party

29
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,720
next month.

30
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,822
Wait, wait.
Reggie is engaged?

31
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,991
But he's like
the poor man's Soos!

32
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,894
I do not want to pressure you,
but you are a man now.

33
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,596
In a way, it's time for you
to start meeting girls.

34
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,065
I would like to see you settled

35
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,734
before I ascend to heaven
and live with the angels.

36
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,035
And with grandpa!

37
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,738
No, he is not there.

38
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,174
Please find a girl to bring
to Reggie's engagement.

39
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,109
For Abuelita.

40
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,679
No problem!

41
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,582
I'm great at fixing stuff,
playing video games,

42
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,883
having a sort-of moustache.

43
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,919
I could totally
get a date in a week.

44
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,053
Totally.

45
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,022
Piece of cake.

46
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,790
<i>You're dead.</i>

47
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,625
I'm dead.

48
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,638
Hello!

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,008
Please don't let my horrible,
elderly face frighten you!

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,376
Don't you want
to use that nickel

51
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,712
to get a nugget
from Old Goldie?

52
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,715
Watch this!

53
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,657
( shrieking )

54
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,200
Okay, seriously, Mr. Pines,

55
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,335
it's time to throw
that thing out.

56
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,105
Its face reminds everyone
of the inevitability of death.

57
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,306
What?

58
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,275
Sure, he's a little rusty
around the edges,

59
00:02:56,277 --> 00:03:00,279
but Old Goldie's
a classic show-stopper like me!

60
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,780
Oh, kill it!

61
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,116
Kill it!

62
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,688
Huh, a woman!

63
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,327
All right, Soos,
you could do this.

64
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,329
Just use your mouth
to say words

65
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,231
that makes romance happen.

66
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,167
Your face is good.

67
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,368
I'm a Soos!

68
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,537
( screams )

69
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,842
Soos?

70
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,944
What was that all about?

71
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,912
I-- I think I was flirting!

72
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,480
But I'm not sure.

73
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,349
Did someone say flirting?

74
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,084
Well, I sort of
promised my grandma

75
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,719
I'd get a date
by the end of the week.

76
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,422
But I've never actually
been on a date before.

77
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,424
You belong on me,
Out of Order sign.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,727
Finally, my prayers
for a chance

79
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,730
to match-make this summer
have been answered!

80
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,333
Soos, a little advice
you need to get rich.

81
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,435
Or lie about being rich.

82
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,203
Outside of that,
I don't like your chances.

83
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,505
Don't listen to Stan, dude.

84
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,940
You're a sweet guy
with a steady job

85
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:02,941
and a pickup truck.

86
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,176
Would you date him?

87
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,445
Oh...
would you look at that...

88
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,481
Soos, you help us so much,
it's time we help you, dude.

89
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,083
We're gonna
get you that date.

90
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,151
We're taking you
where romance lives

91
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,153
and fashion styles die.

92
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,388
To the mall!

93
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,859
I'm gonna go find a replacement
for Old Goldie.

94
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,494
Babysit Soos
while I'm gone.

95
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,364
All right, Soos,

96
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,266
are you ready to explode
a charm bomb

97
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,301
on these poor,
unsuspecting ladies?

98
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,137
Ah, but what if
I embarrass myself again?

99
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,339
Ah, you can't be any worse
at this than Dipper.

100
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah!

101
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,408
Wait...what?

102
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,977
And flirt!

103
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,848
Eye contact!

104
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,182
Hey there!

105
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,851
I'm not scared of your eyes
at all!

106
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,319
I'm gonna look at them!

107
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,353
( screams )

108
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,855
Eye contact.

109
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,423
Conversation!

110
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,426
You know I've actually
been in a pig's body.

111
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,961
Did you know pigs
have a hard time

112
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,962
walking backwards?

113
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,163
Not you though!

114
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,197
Not that
I'm calling you a pig.

115
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,198
Where are you going?

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,067
Confidence!

117
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,371
So you're probably a girl,
right?

118
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,539
Wrong?

119
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,441
No, I was right
the first time.

120
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,144
Wrong?

121
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,980
Tossing away garbage

122
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,949
in the garbage can,
whew!

123
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,219
Ah, don't look at me
like that!

124
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,454
This is how
it's got to be!

125
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,160
What in the--

126
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,835
What is this
living nightmare?

127
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,171
Why do kids
love it so much?

128
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,908
Who wants
to get badgered?

129
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,410
Oh, yeah,
that's Will E. Badger.

130
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,579
He opens for Hoo-Ha
and the Jamboree.

131
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,016
It's Will E. Badger.

132
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,117
I love you, Will E.

133
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,253
Now, give me your money!

134
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,855
Take my money!
Take it all!

135
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,490
Oh!

136
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,560
Sir, I would like
to buy that badger.

137
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,261
You're in over your head,
Gramps!

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,297
Animatronics is
a young man's game!

139
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,100
You couldn't handle
the hardcore life

140
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,434
of the pizza robot manager.

141
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,902
Huh.

142
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,003
Flinched!

143
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,006
Hey, you, barfing
in the ball pit,

144
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,275
Gary's on the case!

145
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,511
I'm gonna
get that badger!

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,314
Don't worry, Soos.

147
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,582
You will find the right girl,

148
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,884
you just need
to stick with it.

149
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,355
Ah, could this day
get any worse?

150
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,491
Oh, no, cousin Reggie!

151
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,327
Feel it, it's muscle.

152
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,395
He can't see me
like this!

153
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,562
I got to hide!

154
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,369
This is it, Soos.

155
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,471
A lifetime of loneliness.

156
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,240
You're the only ones
who could love me...

157
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,675
Fighty Hogg,
Dr. Punch Head MD.

158
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,445
Huh.

159
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,247
Never seen that one before.

160
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,916
"Virtually improve
your dating skills,

161
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,551
9 out of 10 basement dwellers
recommend!"

162
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,520
This is perfect!

163
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,989
Well, I guess you are better
at games than at flirting.

164
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,024
Anything to get you
out there, Soos!

165
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,493
I'm not sure you want
to buy that game, sir.

166
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,495
This is the third time
someone's brought that back.

167
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,632
And there's a note on it
that says destroy at all costs.

168
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,168
So, hey, there.
What's your deal?

169
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,536
Like the--
Oh, she's dead.

170
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,438
We'll take our chances.

171
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,313
Man, I can't wait
for the year 2000.

172
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,216
Uh--

173
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,317
<i>Start!</i>

174
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,455
When the cherry petals
of magic romance academy

175
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,522
are in bloom...

176
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,491
anthyding can hadplen.

177
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,992
That is so true.

178
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,094
<i>Oh, hi there.</i>

179
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,563
<i>My name is Giffany,</i>

180
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,265
<i>I'm a school girl</i>
<i>at school university,</i>

181
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,401
<i>will you help me</i>
<i>carry my books?</i>

182
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,536
I'm really feeling
number two here.

183
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,071
Click!

184
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,406
Ah.
I messed up.

185
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,507
<i>That's okay.</i>

186
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,175
<i>Try again.</i>

187
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,579
Wow!
I'm learning.

188
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,081
And games
are making it fun.

189
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,317
<i>What would you like</i>
<i>to talk about?</i>

190
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,352
I'd rather just
click your face.

191
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,223
<i>You are so funny!</i>

192
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,557
Man, this game
is amazing.

193
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,359
I don't know
why anyone abandoned it.

194
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,761
<i>And I'm sure,</i>
<i>you'll never abandon me,</i>

195
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,296
<i>new boy friend.</i>

196
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,297
Boy friend?

197
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,599
Oh, my Giffany,

198
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,634
it's almost like
you're actually alive!

199
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,436
<i>Yes, almost.</i>

200
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,376
Oh, man, you have
such a nice laugh.

201
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,480
You don't understand,
Wendy.

202
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,316
This animatronic badger sings,
it dances.

203
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,352
It's the perfect
money taking attraction

204
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,620
but he won't sell it to me.

205
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,422
This is literally too dumb
for me to care about.

206
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,224
Hey, have you guys
seen Soos?

207
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,559
We're supposed to help him
with matchmaking today.

208
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,227
Yeah!

209
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,097
I wore my motivational
sweater and everything.

210
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,164
I messed up that part.

211
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,633
He didn't come in today.

212
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,701
It's the first time
he's missed work ever.

213
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,243
So that's basically
my entire life story.

214
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,078
Now you tell me
a thing about you.

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,346
<i>Every time</i>
<i>you compliment me,</i>

216
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,382
<i>I get another highlight</i>
<i>in my eyes.</i>

217
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,050
Ah, you're pretty.

218
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,618
And pixelly.

219
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,786
And so agreeable.

220
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,523
Yes.

221
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,724
Uh, Soos.

222
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,359
Oh, hi, dudes, come in.

223
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,694
This game is amazing.

224
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,463
I'm making eye contact,
going on dates

225
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,831
and I haven't seen
any natural sunlight

226
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,167
for 13 hours.

227
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,371
Soos, maybe it's time to apply
these skills with real girls.

228
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,173
But, I'm about to meet her
parents!

229
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,476
Her dad is an
octopus man.

230
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,245
( screams )

231
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,080
We're going back
to the mall, man.

232
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,515
You need to unplug!

233
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,684
I'll see you later, Giffany.

234
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,819
I'll be back, I swear.

235
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,088
Soos, you don't have
to wish her goodbye.

236
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,456
It's just a game!

237
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,525
It's not like
it's going anywhere.

238
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:57,629
<i>Yes, it's not like</i>
<i>I'm going anywhere.</i>

239
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,436
Hello,

240
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,504
time to read
Soos's diary.

241
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,808
Dang!

242
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,443
Where all of them
sweet honeys at?

243
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,645
I'll check
the ladies bathroom!

244
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,246
It's love time, girls!

245
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,348
Get out there!

246
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,616
No time
to wash your hands!

247
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,150
Get out of here.

248
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,353
It's time to date,
date, date.

249
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,821
And here comes security.

250
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,489
I'll deal with this.

251
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,558
Stay here and practice
on some real girls.

252
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,698
These girls have
so many dimensions

253
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,401
and no explanationy menus.

254
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,169
Ah, my purse.

255
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,170
Oh, no!

256
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,505
Undo! Undo!

257
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,575
You can't undo
who you are.

258
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,648
Oh, man, this is the worst.

259
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,349
I wish I was
back home with...

260
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,684
<i>Hi, Soos.</i>

261
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,386
Giffany!

262
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,488
Oh, man, I am so relieved
to see you!

263
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,390
Although, sort of confused.

264
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,791
<i>Oh, Soos,</i>

265
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>I am not an ordinary game!</i>

266
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,596
<i>I am special.</i>

267
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:08,333
<i>The programmers</i>
<i>tried to delete me.</i>

268
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,602
<i>So I had to delete them.</i>

269
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,173
What did you do to them?

270
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,541
<i>That's not important.</i>

271
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,476
<i>What's important is</i>

272
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,912
<i>you don't have to talk</i>
<i>to real girls ever again.</i>

273
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,480
<i>You and me can</i>
<i>be together...</i>

274
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,217
<i>forever!</i>

275
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,452
Wow, that's awesome!

276
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,520
Sort of a red flag.

277
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,888
But mostly awesome!

278
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,523
So what do you want
to do now?

279
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,692
<i>Anything you want, Soos.</i>

280
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,961
Choo-choo.

281
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,801
<i>COMPUTER: Please insert</i>
<i>50 cents to continue.</i>

282
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,370
Aw, man!

283
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,872
Oh, I'm sorry.

284
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,241
Dude, that's awesome
that you're a grown man

285
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,643
riding a little train
like that.

286
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,711
You're totally
like owning it.

287
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,312
Huh?

288
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,415
Oh, yeah, I'm like,
if it's fun, do it.

289
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,416
You know?

290
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,584
Exactly!

291
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,553
Being an adult
is the worst!

292
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,055
Skewering meat,
remembering to pay bills.

293
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,990
I just want to ride
tiny trains all day.

294
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,226
At least you get to work
at Meat Cute,

295
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,495
extreme lunch meats
are the food of the future.

296
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,830
I feel the same way.

297
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,831
I'm Melody by the way.

298
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,499
I'm Soos!

299
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,534
I tell you,
if you like robots for kids,

300
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,535
you should check out
the best restaurant

301
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,369
of all time.

302
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,871
You mean...

303
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,006
BOTH: Hoo-Ha Owl's
Pizzamatronic Jamboree.

304
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,408
What?

305
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,542
You've heard of Hoo-Ha Owl's?

306
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,377
I loved that place
when I was a kid!

307
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,313
Oh, yeah, dude,
there's one right in this mall!

308
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,714
I should show you sometime.

309
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,483
I'm free around eight?

310
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,617
Boom.
Done.

311
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,818
Perfect.

312
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,620
I'll see you then.

313
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,728
What a nice lady.

314
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,498
Well, back to riding this
tiny train for children.

315
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,033
Soos!

316
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,035
We saw the whole thing, Soos.

317
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,504
That was amazing!

318
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,938
You talked to a real girl.

319
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,607
And you got a date!
I did?

320
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,841
Ah!
Ah!

321
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,310
This is the best day
of my life!

322
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,446
You were in the zone,
you made eye contact.

323
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,915
It was like you'd done this
a million times before!

324
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:04,916
Don't you see?

325
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,384
That game really worked!

326
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,418
You don't need it anymore!

327
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,853
You can toss it out!

328
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:09,854
Toss it?

329
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,389
But I like Giffany!

330
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,423
She's good to me!

331
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,758
She's predictable!

332
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,794
Soos,
can a computer game

333
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,396
go to Reggie's engagement party
with you?

334
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,764
Uh...

335
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,634
Hey, Giffany,
we got to talk.

336
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,435
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I'm programmed to find</i>

337
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,437
everything you say interesting.

338
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,739
Well, have you ever had
to choose between

339
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,541
two things you like,

340
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:30,875
but you don't know
which one is right for you?

341
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,611
I mean,
I'm just thinking long term.

342
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,780
Maybe I should be
with someone a little less

343
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,082
beep-boop, you know.

344
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,450
<i>I don't think you know</i>
<i>what you are saying, Soos.</i>

345
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,386
<i>No one loves you</i>
<i>more than me.</i>

346
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,488
<i>The girls out there</i>
<i>will just make fun of you.</i>

347
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,923
You really think so?

348
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,324
<i>I know so.</i>

349
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,892
<i>Besides, we had a deal.</i>

350
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,328
<i>You bought my game,</i>
<i>you held my books,</i>

351
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,563
<i>you are my boyfriend.</i>

352
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,498
<i>Now sit down in that chair.</i>

353
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,433
I don't think I like the way
you are acting.

354
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,702
<i>I won't let another girl</i>
<i>take you away from me, Soos!</i>

355
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,337
Giffany, calm down.

356
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,772
<i>You are mine, Soos!</i>

357
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:01,940
Pause.

358
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,612
Oh, that got intense.

359
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,847
I'm sorry, Giffany.

360
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,949
Maybe having
a cursed robo girlfriend

361
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,450
wasn't a good idea.

362
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,452
I'm taking you back
to the video game store

363
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,553
after my date
with Melody.

364
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,132
Hello, old friends.

365
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,468
I've got to be careful
this time.

366
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,570
No more Colombian nights.

367
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,672
All right, Stan,
this is weird even for you,

368
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,407
you need to talk?

369
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,576
Nothing you could say
will change my mind, Wendy.

370
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,646
Sometimes, a man has to steal
an animatronic badger

371
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,382
to stay in this crazy game
called life.

372
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,017
Or you could just not care.

373
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,485
It's about the principle.

374
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,888
No one tells Stan Pines
he is out of the game.

375
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,155
No one tells--

376
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,991
( screams )

377
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,859
I'll get your
orthopedic back pillow.

378
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,027
Thank you!

379
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,496
You can do this, Soos.

380
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,832
Just remember
what your love crew taught you!

381
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,100
How does she look?

382
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,101
Nice!

383
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,168
What are her stories?

384
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,436
Interesting!

385
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,005
And who's gonna
pay for dinner?

386
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,673
Soos is!

387
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,041
Now date!

388
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,542
( blows horn )

389
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,077
( Soos screaming )

390
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,179
They grow up so fast.

391
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,948
Itchy legs, itchy legs.

392
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,116
Oh, hi, Soos.

393
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,550
Melody!

394
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:24,055
Are you ready
for a date with me?

395
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,790
( laughing )

396
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,158
I totally am.

397
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,862
Good show, man.

398
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,563
Way to warm them up!

399
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,932
I wish I was more like you.

400
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,938
Man, I could go for some

401
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,007
complimentary bread sticks
right now.

402
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,709
One time
I was so hungry

403
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,079
I ate the decorational bamboo
in a Chinese restaurant.

404
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,548
Like a big old panda.

405
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,551
You're hilarious.

406
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,954
Well, you know,
I just sort of say

407
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,156
whatever
pops into my--

408
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,864
Soos, are you okay?

409
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:07,865
No, I'm fine.

410
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:08,866
Everything's fine.

411
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,001
Are you sure?

412
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,703
You are spitting
an awful lot.

413
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,772
Uh, could you sit tight?

414
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,975
I have go to the bathroom
for a long time.

415
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,910
Not in a weird way.

416
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,547
Soos!
What are you doing out there?

417
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,615
I got a big problem, guys,
I am being stalked by Giffany.

418
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,984
Giffany?

419
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,652
Or maybe
it's pronounced Giffany.

420
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,853
I was never really sure.

421
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,555
Soos, get a grip on yourself.

422
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,091
Giffany can't stalk you
because she is not real.

423
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,564
Uh-oh.

424
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,965
Take it from someone
who brought

425
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,568
an arcade game to life.
This will not end well.

426
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,237
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure
she is stuck on TV screens.

427
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,142
<i>Ah, a new challenger</i>
<i>approaches,</i>

428
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,243
<i>prepare to be--</i>

429
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,582
Oh, boy.

430
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,817
So hey! Anyway, you want to move
this date into the forest

431
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,853
far away from all electronics
and people?

432
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,288
What? But the floor show's
about to start!

433
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,291
( music plays )

434
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,300
Who wants to hear
Hoo-Ha the owl!

435
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,075
Hello, friends,
Hoo-Ha the owl is dead.

436
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,947
This next song goes out to my
forever boyfriend, Soos.

437
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,716
Soos, what's going on?

438
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,750
No time to explain!

439
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,951
We got to get out of here!

440
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,558
The only way out, Soos,
is in my arms.

441
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,659
Capture them!

442
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,263
( growling )

443
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,998
( people screaming )

444
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,567
Done!

445
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,002
Out with the old,
in with the new!

446
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,637
I feel invincible.

447
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,739
Ah!

448
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,274
What--
what the--

449
00:17:56,276 --> 00:18:00,611
Who wants to get badgered?

450
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,816
Sorry, Soos.

451
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:08,219
But you can't run away
from our relationship.

452
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,960
So about all this,

453
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,595
I may have purchased
a dating simulator

454
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,597
that attained sentience
and went crazy.

455
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,898
Oh, I am crazy.

456
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,734
Crazy for you, Soos.

457
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,937
Ah!

458
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,605
Oh, no.

459
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,273
Oh, I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this!

460
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,942
It's me that she wants.

461
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,277
I'll distract her while
Dipper and Mabel keep you safe.

462
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,979
It's the only way.

463
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,647
Soos, these are children.

464
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,950
The only way!

465
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,685
( groaning )

466
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,686
Over here, Giffany!

467
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,753
Stop!

468
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,260
On three, we split.

469
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,629
One, two-

470
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,164
( screaming )

471
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,134
Stay back, you monster!

472
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,735
Ah!

473
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,647
Yes, yes, get him, Goldie,
get him.

474
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,656
I'm gonna eat your face
like pizza.

475
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,736
I have got you surrounded,
Soos.

476
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,938
There is no way out.

477
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,406
Please, let my friends go.

478
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,708
I'll do anything you want.
I promise.

479
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,745
I seem to remember
someone promising

480
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,381
he will be my boyfriend.

481
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,317
<i>Think about it,</i>
<i>real girls are unpredictable,</i>

482
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,153
they judge you.

483
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,156
<i>You really think Melody</i>
<i>is going to take you back</i>

484
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,425
<i>after this awful date?</i>

485
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,397
I can download your brain
into the game with me

486
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,899
and we will be together
forever.

487
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,967
Ah!

488
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,336
Stay back.

489
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,871
Come on, Soos.

490
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:10,341
Don't make me
to leave you, too.

491
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,742
What do you say?

492
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,246
I say, game over,
Giffany!

493
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,915
No!
Wait!

494
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,303
You did it!

495
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,838
You old, beautiful monster!

496
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,240
You did it!

497
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,175
How's about you and me
hit the town?

498
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,844
These old has-beens
are going to Vegas!

499
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,351
I'm sorry for all this.

500
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,952
I honestly remember
this place being a lot more fun

501
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,354
when I was a kid.

502
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,923
Believe it or not,
I've been on worse dates.

503
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,924
Really?

504
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,192
Never date a magician.

505
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,494
Ew!
Why would I?

506
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,429
Oh, hey, you wouldn't maybe
be interested

507
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,464
in coming to my cousin's

508
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,099
engagement party
in a week?

509
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,901
I promise there is like
zero robot badgers.

510
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,170
Yeah, I'll still be
in town then.

511
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,805
Still be in town?

512
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,941
I'm going back home to Portland
in a few weeks

513
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,277
but we can video chat,
if that's okay with you?

514
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,544
A relationship with a girl

515
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,847
that I can only see
through my computer,

516
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,283
sounds perfect.

517
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,552
Spirit of love,
we did it.

518
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,322
Yes, yes,
I'm so happy.

519
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,457
Have you been
following us all day?

520
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,926
Soos's life
is my soap opera.

521
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,462
