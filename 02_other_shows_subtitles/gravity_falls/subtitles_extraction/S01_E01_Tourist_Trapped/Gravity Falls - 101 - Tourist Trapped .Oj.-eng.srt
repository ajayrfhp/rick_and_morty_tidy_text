00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,059
<i>Ah, summer break...</i>

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,118
- You want cheese on that hon?
- Sure, Hank.

3
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:12,324
<i>A time for leisure, recreation,</i>

4
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,332
<i>and takin' 'er easy...</i>

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,413
<i>Unless you're me.</i>

6
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,350
Aaaah!!!

7
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,371
It's getting closer!

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:31,441
<i>My name is Dipper.</i>

9
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,362
<i>The girl about to puke
is my sister Mabel.</i>

10
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:36,381
<i>You may be wondering what
we're doing in a golf cart</i>

11
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,396
<i>fleeing from a creature
of unimaginable horror.</i>

12
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:39,396
- Aah!
- Aaah!

13
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,400
- Look out!
- Aahh!

14
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:48,382
<i>Rest assured,
there's a perfectly
logical explanation.</i>

00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,572
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

17
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,227
<i>It all began</i>

18
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:36,364
<i>when our parents decided
we could use some fresh air.</i>

19
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,229
<i>They shipped us up north
to a sleepy town</i>

20
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>called Gravity Falls, Oregon,</i>

21
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:44,162
<i>to stay at our great-uncle's
place in the woods.</i>

22
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:46,216
This attic is amazing!

23
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:49,174
Check out all my splinters!

24
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,212
Baaa!

25
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:52,187
And there's a goat on my bed.

26
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,237
Hey, friend.

27
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:58,216
Oh! Yes, you can keep
chewing on my sweater.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

28
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,141
<i>My sister tended to look
on the bright side of things.</i>

29
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,179
Yay! Grass!

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,159
<i>But I was having a hard time</i>

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,159
<i>getting used to
our new surroundings.</i>

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,184
- Boo!
- Aaaah!

33
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,183
Aha ha ha ha!

34
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:12,208
<i>And then was
our great-uncle Stan...</i>

35
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,145
<i>that guy.</i>

36
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:15,199
Aha ha ha ha...

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,141
It was worth it.

38
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:21,149
<i>Our uncle had transformed
his house into a tourist trap</i>

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,238
<i>he called the Mystery Shack.</i>

40
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,212
<i>The </i>real <i>mystery was
why anyone came.</i>

41
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,224
Ladies and gentlemen, behold...

44
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:35,162
<i>And guess who
had to work there.</i>

45
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:36,208
Oh!

46
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,229
No touching the merchandise!

47
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,183
<i>It looked like it was gonna be
the same boring routine</i>

48
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,221
<i>all summer,</i>

49
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:45,180
<i>until one fateful day...</i>

50
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,191
He's looking at it.
He's looking at it!

51
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,208
Uh...

52
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,162
"Do you like me?

53
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,170
"Yes. Definitely.

54
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,209
Absolutely"?

55
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,196
- I rigged it!
- Mabel,

56
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,158
I know you're going through
your whole "boy crazy" phase,

57
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,229
- but I think you're kind of overdoing
it with the "crazy" part.
- What?!

58
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,229
Come <i>on, </i>Dipper!

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,233
This is our first summer
away from home.

60
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:14,183
It's my big chance to have
an epic summer romance.

61
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,166
Yeah, but do you need to flirt
with every guy you meet?

62
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:21,237
My name is Mabel,
but you can call me
the girl of your dreams.

63
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:24,237
I'm joking!
Ha ha ha ha!

64
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,162
Oh, my gosh, you like turtles?

65
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:31,203
I like turtles <i>too.
</i>What is happening here?

66
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:33,166
Come one, come all,

67
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,162
to the mattress prince's
kingdom of savings!

68
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,221
- Take me with you.
- Aaah!

69
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:40,216
Mock all you want, brother,

70
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,220
but I got a good feeling
about this summer.

71
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,162
I wouldn't be surprised
if the man of my dreams

72
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,142
walked through that door
right now.

73
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:52,145
Oh! Oh! Not good. Ow.

74
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,171
- Oh, why?!
- Ha ha ha!

75
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:55,230
All right, look alive, people.

76
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:58,345
I need someone to go
hammer up these signs in
the spooky part of the forest.

77
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,410
- Not it! - Not it!
- Uh, also not it.

78
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,464
Nobody asked you, Soos.

79
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,443
I know, and I'm
comfortable with that.

80
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,480
Wendy! I need you
to put up this sign!

81
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:11,472
I would, but I... uhh...
can't... uhh... reach it.

82
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,463
I'd fire all of you if I could.

83
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:16,467
All right, let's make it
eeny-meeny-miney...

84
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:18,460
- You.
- Oh! What?

85
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:21,459
Grunkle Stan,
whenever I'm in those woods
I feel like I'm being watched.

86
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,435
- Ahh, <i>this </i>again.
- I'm telling you,

87
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,421
Something weird is going on
in this town.

88
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,452
Just today my mosquito bites
spelled out "beware."

89
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,414
That says "bewarb."

90
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,409
Look, kid, the whole
"monsters in the forest" thing
is just local legend

91
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,427
drummed up by guys like me
to sell merch to guys like that.

92
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:42,435
So quit being so paranoid!

93
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,493
Ugh. Grunkle Stan.

94
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:53,423
Nobody ever believes
anything I say.

95
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,485
Huh?

96
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,477
Baaa!

97
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,410
What the...?

98
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,480
"It's hard to believe
it's been six years
since I began studying

99
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:37,473
the strange
and wondrous secrets
of Gravity Falls, Oregon."

100
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:43,488
What <i>is </i>all this?

101
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,463
"Unfortunately, my suspicions
have been confirmed.

102
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:47,471
"I'm being watched.

103
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,473
"I must hide this book
before <i>he </i>finds it.

104
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,431
Remember, in Gravity Falls,
there is no one you can trust."

105
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,498
No one you can trust...

106
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,452
- Hello!
- Aaah!

107
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,459
Whatcha readin'?
Some nerd thing?

108
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,451
Uh... uh... it's nothing.

109
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,430
"Uh-uh... it's nothing."

110
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,434
What? Are you
actually not gonna show me?

111
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,434
Uh...

112
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,444
Let's go somewhere private.

113
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:13,459
It's amazing!

114
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,472
Grunkle Stan said
I was being paranoid,

115
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:19,463
but according to this book,
Gravity Falls has this
secret dark side.

116
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,488
Whoa! Shut <i>up!</i>

117
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:23,493
After a certain point,

118
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:25,472
the pages just stop,

119
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,476
like the guy who was writing it
mysteriously disappeared.

120
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,422
Who's that?

121
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Well, time to spill the beans.

122
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,467
Broop. Beans.

123
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,497
This girl's got a date.
Whoo whoo!

124
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:38,494
- Ha ha ha!
- Let me get this straight.

125
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:42,426
In the half hour I was gone
you already found a boyfriend?

126
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:43,464
What can I say?

127
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:46,488
I guess I'm just irresistible!

128
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,405
Oh!

129
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:49,435
Coming!

130
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,481
- What you readin' there, slick?
- Oh!

131
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,413
I was just catchin' up on,
uh...

132
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:59,468
- "Gold chains for old men magazine"?
- That's a good issue.

133
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,463
Hey, family!

134
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,477
Say hello to my new boyfriend!

135
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,422
'Sup?

136
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:08,485
- Hey.
- How's it hangin'.

137
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:11,480
We met at the cemetery.
He's <i>really </i>deep.

138
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,480
Ooh! Little muscle there.

139
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:16,422
What...
what a surprise.

140
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:17,489
So what's your name?

141
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,476
Uh... Normal... Man!

142
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:22,485
He means "Norman."

143
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,481
Are you bleeding, Norman?

144
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,476
It's jam.

145
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:30,413
Oh! I <i>love </i>jam!

146
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,405
Look at <i>this!</i>

147
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:36,409
So, you wanna go hold hands
or... whatever?

148
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,493
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

149
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:39,502
Don't wait up!

150
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,498
<i>There was something about
Norman that wasn't right.</i>

151
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,434
<i>I decided to consult
the journal...</i>

152
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,443
"Known for their pale skin
and bad attitudes,

Teenagers?!

Zombie!"

157
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:06,501
Did somebody say "cromby"?
What is that, "cromby"?

158
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,494
It's not even a word.
You're losin' your mind.

159
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,480
I like you.

160
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:17,431
Oh, no! Mabel!

161
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:22,477
- No! No, Mabel! Watch out!
- Uhh!

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,494
Aaaah!

163
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,426
Uhh.

164
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:27,651
Daisies?

165
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,748
You scallywag!

166
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:32,102
Is my sister really
dating a zombie,

167
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,404
or am I just going nuts?

168
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,382
It's a dilemma, to be sure.

169
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,557
I couldn't help but overhear you
talking aloud to yourself
in this empty room.

170
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,813
Soos, you've seen
Mabel's boyfriend.

171
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,776
He's gotta be a zombie, right?

172
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,830
Hmm. How many brains
did you see the guy eat?

173
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,818
- Zero.
- Look, dude, I believe you.

174
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,834
I'm always noticing
weird stuff in this town.

175
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:52,781
Like the mailman? Pretty sure
that dude's a werewolf.

176
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,821
But you gotta have evidence.

177
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,755
Otherwise people are gonna think
you're a major league
cuckoo clock.

178
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:04,826
As always, Soos, you're right.

179
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,826
My wisdom is both a blessing
and a curse.

180
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,759
Soos!
The portable toilets
are clogged again!

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,797
I am needed elsewhere.

182
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,754
<i>My sister could be in trouble.</i>

183
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,739
<i>It was time to get
some evidence.</i>

184
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:27,831
Aaauuggh!

185
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:39,760
Aaah!

186
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:41,831
Aauggh!

187
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,764
<i>I'd seen enough.</i>

188
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,784
Mabel, we've gotta
talk about Norman.

189
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,764
Isn't he the <i>best?
</i>Check out this giant
smooch mark he gave me!

190
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,751
- Aaah!
- Ha ha!

191
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:01,739
Gullible. It was just
an accident with
the leaf blower.

192
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,800
Kissing practice!

193
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,826
Mmm... Mmm...

194
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,800
Aah! Turn it off!

195
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,771
Turn it <i>off!</i>

196
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,835
- That was fun.
- No! Mabel, listen.

197
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:19,755
I'm trying to tell you
that Norman is not
what he seems!

198
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,759
You think
he might be a vampire?

199
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,835
That would be so <i>awesome!</i>

200
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,755
Guess again, sister.

201
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:26,827
- Sha-bam!
- Aaah!

202
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,742
Oh, wait. I'm...
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,768
- Sha-bam!
- A zombie?

204
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:31,804
That is not funny, Dipper.

205
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,835
I'm not joking!

206
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,830
It all adds up:
the bleeding, the limp...

207
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,788
He never blinks!
Have you noticed that?

208
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,742
Maybe <i>he's </i>blinking
when <i>you're </i>blinking.

209
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,827
Mabel, remember
what the book said
about Gravity Falls?

210
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,780
"Trust no one"!

211
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,821
What about me, huh?
Why can't you trust <i>me?</i>

212
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:49,831
- Beep-bop!
- Mabel!

213
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,821
He's gonna eat your brain!

214
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,776
Dipper, listen to me.

215
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,835
Norman and I are going
on a date at five o'clock,

216
00:10:55,836 --> 00:11:00,738
and I'm gonna be <i>adorable,
</i>and he's gonna be <i>dreamy.</i>

217
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:01,818
- Wait! But... but... but...
- And I'm not gonna let you ruin it

218
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:04,789
with one of your
crazy conspiracies!

219
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,743
Ohh. What am I gonna do?

220
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,835
Coming!

221
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:14,806
Hey, Norman.
How do I look?

222
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,809
Shiny!

223
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,747
You always know what to say!

224
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:24,826
Soos is right.

225
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,788
I don't have any real evidence.

226
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,834
I guess I can be kind of
paranoid sometimes, and...

227
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,739
wait! <i>What?!</i>

228
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,784
Aaah! I was right!
Oh, my God!

229
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:40,805
Oh, my God! Grunkle Stan!
Grunkle Stan! Grunkle Stan!

230
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,780
And here we have
"rock that looks
like a face" rock...

231
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,771
the rock that
looks like a face.

232
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,831
- Does it look like a rock?
- No, it looks like a face.

233
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,793
- <i>Is </i>it a face?
- It's a rock that <i>looks </i>like a face!

234
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:52,809
Over here!
Grunkle Stan!

235
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,738
For the fifth time,
it's not an actual face!

236
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,743
Grrrr!!!

237
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,738
Finally, we're alone.

238
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,742
Yes... <i>Alone.</i>

239
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:06,738
Stan! Stan!

240
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:07,809
Wendy! Wendy!

241
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,792
I need to
borrow the golf cart so I can
save my sister from a zombie!

242
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,797
Try not to hit any pedestrians.

243
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,818
Dude, it's me, Soos.

244
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:23,751
- This is for the zombies.
- Thanks.

245
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,813
And this is in case
you see a piñata.

246
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,738
Uh... Thanks?

247
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,751
Better safe than sorry!

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,817
Mable,

249
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,742
now that we've gotten
to know each other,

250
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:36,767
there's...

251
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:39,788
There's something
I should tell you.

252
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:42,780
Oh, Norman!
You can tell me <i>anything!</i>

253
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:44,796
<i>Please be a vampire,
please be a vampire.</i>

254
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,763
All right, just...
just don't freak out, okay?

255
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,806
Just... just keep an open mind.
Be cool.

256
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,763
Is this weird?
Is this too weird?

257
00:12:58,764 --> 00:12:59,831
You need to sit down?

258
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,830
R-right. I'll explain.

259
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:06,738
So, we're gnomes, first off,
get that one out of the way.

260
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,818
- Uh...
- I'm Jeff,

261
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,780
and here we have Carson, Steve,

262
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:12,546
Jason and...

263
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,835
I'm sorry,
I always forget your name.

264
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,784
Shmebulock.

265
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,742
Shmebulock. Yes!

266
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:19,835
Anyways, long story short,

267
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:23,817
us gnomes have been
lookin' for a new queen.
Right, guys?

268
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:26,817
Queen! Queen!

269
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,818
Heh! So whaddya say?

270
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,826
Will you join us
in holy matri-gnome-y?

271
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,805
Matri... matri... <i>mony?</i>

272
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,784
Bleahh!
Can't <i>talk </i>today.

273
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,742
Look...

274
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,826
I'm sorry, guys,
you're really sweet,

275
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:47,759
but I'm a girl
and you're gnomes

276
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,780
and it's like, "what?!"

277
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,800
Yikes.

278
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,538
We understand.
We'll never forget you,
Mabel.

279
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,916
- Because we're gonna kidnap you.
- Huh?!

280
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:04,805
Don't worry, Mabel!
I'll save you from that zombie!

281
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,776
Help!!!!

282
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:08,751
Hold on!

283
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:14,830
The more you struggle,
the more awkward this is
gonna be for everybody.

284
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,809
Just... ha ha!... Okay,
just get her arm there,
Steve.

285
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,831
Aah! Let go of me!

286
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,756
Uhh...

287
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:27,826
what the <i>heck
</i>is goin' on here?!

288
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,788
Aah!

289
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,759
Dipper! Norman turned out
to be a bunch of gnomes!

290
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,829
And they're total jerks!

291
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,827
Uhh! Hair! Hair!

292
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:38,809
Gnomes? Huh.
I was <i>way </i>off.

293
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,788
"Gnomes. Little men
of the Gravity Falls forest.

294
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,750
"Weaknesses:" unknown.

295
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,738
Oh, <i>come </i>on!

296
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,746
Hey! Hey!
Let go of my sister!

297
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:50,738
Oh! Ha ha. Hey there!
Um, ya know,

298
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,038
this is all really just
a big misunderstanding,
ya see?

299
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,740
Your sister's not in danger...

300
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,756
She's just marrying
all one thousand of us

301
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,826
and become our gnome queen
for all eternity.

302
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,746
Isn't that right, honey?

303
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,805
You guys are butt-faces!

304
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:04,834
Give her back right now,
or <i>else!</i>

305
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,755
You think you can stop us, boy?

306
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,750
You have no idea what
we're capable of.

307
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,817
The gnomes are a powerful race!

308
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:14,826
Do not trifle with the...

309
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,785
Aaaah!

310
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,771
He's getting away
with our queen!

311
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:22,785
No, no, <i>no!!!</i>

312
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:23,806
Seat belt.

313
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:29,746
You've messed with
the wrong creatures, boy.

314
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,831
Gnomes of the forest...
Assemble!

315
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,826
Hurry! Before they
come after us!

316
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:47,827
I wouldn't worry about it.

317
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:51,743
You see their little legs?
Suckers are tiny.

318
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,747
Dang.

319
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,818
All right, teamwork, guys!
Like we practiced.

320
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:05,751
Move. Move!

321
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,814
- Come back with our queen!
- It's getting closer!

322
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,780
Eh!

323
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,772
Yahh!

324
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:23,746
Brahh!!

325
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,772
Shmebulock!

326
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,746
I'll save you, Dipper!

327
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,738
Uh! Ow! Uh! Uh!
Uh! Uh! Uh!

328
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:34,739
Uh!!!

329
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,739
- Thanks, Mabel.
- Don't mention it.

330
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,827
Yahh!

331
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:44,806
Look out!

332
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,796
Stay back, man!

333
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,835
Uhh!

334
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,763
Where's Grunkle Stan?

335
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:04,742
Behold!

336
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:06,796
The world's most
distracting object!

337
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,739
- Oooh!
- Just try to look away... you can't!

338
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,830
I can't even remember
what I was talkin' about.

339
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,767
It's the end of the line, kids.

340
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,738
Mabel, marry us before
we do something crazy!

341
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,750
There's gotta be
a way out of this!

342
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,739
- I gotta do it.
- What?!

343
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,750
Mabel, don't do this!
Are you crazy?

344
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,743
- Trust me.
- What?!

345
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,764
Dipper, just this once...
<i>Trust </i>me.

346
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,814
- All right, Jeff, I'll marry you.
- Hot dog!

347
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,805
Help me down there, Jason.
Thanks. Andy, left foot,

348
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:43,764
there we go,
watch those fingers, Mike.

349
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,831
Ehh? Ehh?

350
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:50,827
Bada-Bing, bada-bam!

351
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,827
Now let's get you back
into the forest, honey!

352
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,830
You may now kiss the bride.

353
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:58,739
Well, uh, don't mind if I do.

354
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,767
Aah!

355
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,742
Hey, wait a minute!
Ahh-aahh...

356
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:09,821
Whoa! Whoa!
W-what's going on?

357
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,746
Aah! Aaah!

358
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,826
That's for lying to me!

359
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,821
That's for breaking my heart!

360
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,776
Ow! My face!

361
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:21,759
And <i>this </i>is for
messing with my brother!

362
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
- Wanna do the honors?
- On three.

363
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,747
One, two, three!

364
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,747
I'll... Get you back
for this!!!!!

365
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:33,827
Who's giving orders?
I need orders!

366
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:36,809
My arms are tired!

367
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,760
Anyone else wants some?

368
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:45,801
Baaaa!

369
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,746
Hey, Dipper. I, um,

370
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,771
I'm sorry for
ignoring your advice.

371
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,776
You really were just
looking out for me.

372
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:58,738
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there.

373
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,771
I guess I'm just sad
that my first boyfriend

374
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,764
turned out to be
a bunch of gnomes.

375
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,788
Look on the bright side...
Maybe the next one
<i>will </i>be a vampire.

376
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,834
You're just saying that.

377
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,830
Awkward sibling hug?

378
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:11,809
Awkward sibling hug.

379
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,831
- Pat pat.
- Pat pat.

380
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,809
Sheesh! You two get hit
by a bus or somethin'?

381
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,810
Aha!

382
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,746
Uh, hey!

383
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,797
W-wouldn't you know it?

384
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,763
Um, I accidentally
overstocked some inventory,

385
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:32,738
so how's about each of you
take one item from the gift shop
on the house?

386
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,827
- Really?
- What's the catch?

387
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,809
The catch is do it
before I change my mind.
Now take something.

388
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,822
- Hmm...
- Oooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

389
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,817
Hmm. That oughta
do the trick.

390
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,817
And I will have a...

391
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,805
Grappling hook!

392
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:53,806
- Yes!
- Wouldn't you rather have
a doll or something?

393
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,835
- Grappling hook!
- Fair enough.
