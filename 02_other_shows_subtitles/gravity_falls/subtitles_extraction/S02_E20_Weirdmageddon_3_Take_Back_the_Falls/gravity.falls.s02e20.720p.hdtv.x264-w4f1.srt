   I thought I lost you two.

00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,663
             Ahh!

       it's really you!

00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,566
 I've been hugging strangers
 to practice for this moment.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,535
We missed you,
you old codger.

9
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,770
         ( chuckles )
       I've missed you
      knuckleheads too.

10
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,539
  It's good to have you back.

11
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:25,874

doing here?

12
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:28,711
          ( gasps )
     Yeah, there's, like,
     monsters and gnomes.

13
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,846
                And is Pacifica
         wearing a potato sack?

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,716
            Hey! Even in a sack
  I still look better than you.

Grunkle Stan,
how'd this all happen?

39
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,232
         So I was hammering
         signs out back

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,367
     when the sky started
     vomiting nightmares.

41
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,269
                    I listen to
             a lot of AM radio,

42
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,072
    so I knew what this meant--
          the end of the world.

            the unicorn spell!

49
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,400
                That's why this
              is the only place
      Bill's magic can't touch.

50
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,502
     That's when Possum Breath
     over here shows up

51
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,238
  leading a bunch of injured
stragglers through the forest.

52
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,439
    They needed a place to stay,

53
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,341
                      and since
        the Mayor got captured,

54
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,544
       I elected myself
       de facto chief.

55
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,147
The plan's to stay in here
and eat brown meat
until we run out.

56
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,515
  Then I vote
  we eat the gnomes.

 Shh! Shh! Stress will
 make you chewy.

59
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,323
 Grunkle Stan,
 we can't all just hide
 inside the Shack.

60
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,225
   There's a town
   in need of saving!

61
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,428
 Me and Ford tried to do it,
 but he got captured by Bill.

62
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,163
         Serves that jerk right!

63
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,265
          My brother's had
          some stupid plans,

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,502
     but going up against
 an all-powerful space demon
    was his worst one yet.

65
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,505
                      Trust me,
             we have everything
            we need right here.

66
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,242
             It's not the Ritz,
      but at least the monsters
    inside know how to massage.

67
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,345
      You know Shiatsu?
       Yes, I've taken
        some classes.

68
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,514
              So, you're really
       just gonna let Bill win?

69
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,516
Look, kiddo.
We got a good deal here.

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,186
  Besides, I'm sure wherever
the rest of the townsfolk are,

71
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,287
     they're fine.

                  their friends

79

  save the people of this town?

00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,189
    but even <i> they </i> don't

00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,523
        Curse you, Bill!

88
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,326
      Why must you take
     everything we love?

     Our friends need us,

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,500
    but we only save them
      if we fight back!

92
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:32,137
                Mabel is right.
 Bill wants us to run and hide.

93
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,172
          He wants us to think
          he's invincible.

94
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,108
               But Ford told me
         before he was captured

95
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,377
                  that he knows
        Bill's secret weakness.

98
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,515
     Now, if we band together,

99
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,084
        if we combine
        all of our strength,

           ( groans )

133
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,133
              Aah!

134
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,434
         Quit the games, Cipher!

135
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,270
            If I'm still alive,
                  you must want
             something from me.

136
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,506
  <i> Ah, sharp as ever,</i>
  <i> Fordsy.</i>

137
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,241
   <i> As you may have noticed...</i>

138
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,177
     <i> I've recently had a</i>
 <i> multi-dimensional makeover!</i>

139
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,279
  <i> I control space and matter,</i>

140
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,348
   <i> and now that that dumb</i>
   <i> baby's out of the way,</i>

141
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,083
          <i> time itself!</i>

142
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,419
        <i> But I wasn't</i>
      <i> always this way. </i>
             Oof!

143
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,354
       <i> You think those</i>
      <i> chains are tight?</i>

144
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,523
      <i> Imagine living in</i>
   <i> the second dimension--</i>

145
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,459
 <i> flat minds in a flat world</i>
      <i> with flat dreams.</i>

146
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,263
  <i> I liberated my dimension,</i>
   <i> Stanford, and I'm here</i>
     <i> to liberate yours.</i>

147
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,199
       <i> There's just one hitch.</i>
       <i> As it turns out,</i>

148
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,103
     <i> my weirdness can't escape</i>
     <i> the magical confines</i>
     <i> of this town!</i>

149
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,272
         <i> There's something</i>
         <i> keeping me in.</i>

150
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:51,443
Incredible!
Gravity Falls' Natural Law
of Weirdness Magnetism.

151
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,311
 I studied this years ago!

152
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,114
   <i> And did you find a way</i>
        <i> to undo it? </i>
          Of course!

153
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,316
There's a simple equation that
could collapse the barrier.

154
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,118
    But I'd never tell you!

155
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,054
           <i> Listen, Ford,</i>
           <i> if you just tell me</i>
           <i> that equation,</i>

156
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,357
   <i> finally your dimension</i>
        <i> will be free!</i>

157
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,194
   <i> Anything will be possible!</i>

158
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,433
       ( all screaming )

159
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:19,037
  <i> I'll remake a fun world-</i>
  <i> a better world!</i>

160
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,374
<i>A party that never ends</i>
<i>with a host that never dies!</i>

161
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,176
     <i> No more restrictions!</i>

162
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,477
         <i> No more laws!</i>

163
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,212
      <i> You'd be one of us.</i>

164
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,380
         <i> All-powerful!</i>

165
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,116
    <i> Greater than anything</i>
      <i> you've imagined!</i>

166
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,218
  <i> And all I need is your help.</i>

167
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,220
You're insane
if you think I'll help you.

168
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,156
    <i> Ha ha ha! I'm insane</i>
    <i> either way, brainiac!</i>

169
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,391
          <i> But have it your way.</i>

170
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,493
         <i> I'll just fish around</i>
         <i> and get that equation</i>

171
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,062
     <i> directly out of your mind!</i>

172
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,263
    Not so fast!

173
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,498
You know the rules, Bill.

174
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,168
 You may be able
 to haunt my dreams,

175
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,436
but you can't enter my mind

176
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,406
unless I shake your hand
and let you in.

177
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,507
            <i> ( sighs )</i>
            <i> You're making this</i>

00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,217
    <i> It's only a matter of time.</i>

182
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,219
             Aaaah!

183
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,076
     All right. I've made
    some thingamadiculous
    robomajigs in my day,

184
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,979
but this is the first one
that <i> won't </i> be used for evil!

185
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,815
         Whoa! These blueprints
      are incredible, McGucket.

186
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,084
MABEL: This is your most
amazing invention yet.

187
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,220
    Question: Does it have
       any gun-swords?

188
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,055
        I watch a lot
      of anime and, uh,

189
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,858
    trust me, you're gonna
    want some gun-swords.

190
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,193
 What's an "anime"?

191
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,796
   We have much to discuss.
            STAN:
      Discuss, nothing!

192
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,866
These scribbles are a bunch
of cockamamie balderdash!

193
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,034
Excuse my French.

   <i> ( voice speaking French )</i>

And where would you
even find a bunch of idiots
crazy enough to build it?

196
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,975
                  Grunkle Stan,
                 you're lookin'
               at those idiots.

00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,176
        ( all cheering )

198
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,844
              Idiots!

200
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,222

            What are you--

201
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,024
       Hey-- Hey, now.
       Hey! Don't touch that.

202
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,092
            Hey--
             Aah!

203
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,832
                Uhh! Uhh!

204
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,168
      Aaah!

205
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,845
  ( "action" music continues )

206
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,292
       Thanks for these
 apocalypse sweaters, Mabel.

207
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,794
           The end of the world
 has never been so comfortable.

208
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,029

                Uhh! Fine,
                I'll <i> wear </i> it.

211
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,036
            But I'm <i> not </i> gonna
                       like it.

212
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,905
Admit it. This is the best day
   of the end of the world.

213
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,907
I think we actually have
a chance to beat Bill

214
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,109
 and win back our future.

215
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,111
             Yeah. Getting
             to actually <i> live</i>

216
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,879
                     to see our
            13th birthday party

217
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,248
   is the only birthday present
              I want right now.

218
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,150
        Hey, if we're
  lucky enough to get there,

219
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,219
 I guarantee this whole town
      is gonna throw you

220
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,888
  the best birthday party
  you've ever seen.

221
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,156
               Thanks, Soos.

222
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,292
                Hey, has anyone
             seen Grunkle Stan?

223
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,160
  This whole plan is bonkers.

224
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,896
 But of course, no one asked
  the Chief what he thinks.

225
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,865
     After all I've done

       Yeah, exactly--
      it's a total load
       of schmebulock.

228
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,204
            Is something wrong,
                  Grunkle Stan?

229
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,174
                  You're acting
          grunklier than usual.

230
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,843
     It's this darn plan
     to save my brother.

231
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,246
          If you didn't notice,
       I already saved him once
              from that portal,

232
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,014
    and he never thanked me!

233
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,316
       He causes
       the end of the world,

234
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,084
   and somehow it's still always

235
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,920
    "Stan's the screw-up,
      Ford's the hero."

236
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,922
      Well, maybe people
      think he's a hero

237
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,091
         because he didn't want
  to hide in the Mystery Shack!

238
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,261
Well, maybe if he hid in
the Mystery Shack he
wouldn't have been captured!

239
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:50,065
    Guys! Guys! Trust me,
  tomorrow's gonna be great!

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,988
          Come here, old friend.

Hey, good to see you too, bro.
Now let's get out of here, huh?

379
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,794
     Listen, Uncle Ford,
 we don't have a lot of time.

380
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,796
   Remember how you told me
 right before you were frozen

381
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,698
 that you knew Bill's weakness?

382
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,867
             Yeah, a secret way
                 to defeat him?

383
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,568
             I-- I do!

384
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:10,571
   Now, does anyone have a pen?
              Pencil? Anything?

385
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,639
                 Ah.

            Perfect!

387
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,745
  Uh, we've got Bill outside,

388
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,947
  but I don't know how long
  we can keep him occupied.

389
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,783
           Yes, yes. Good, good.

534
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,364
        GRUNKLE STAN:
 Ohh! I can't <i> believe </i> this!

535
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,467
   The kids are gonna die,
   and it's all my fault--

536
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:34,538
   because I couldn't shake
      your stupid hand!

537
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,373
Ahh, Dad was right about me.
I <i> am </i> a screw-up.

538
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,509
      Ah, don't blame yourself.
                    I'm the one

539
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,644
      who made a deal with Bill
            in the first place.

540
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,780
                I fell for all
             his easy flattery.

541
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,749
        You would have seen him
     for the scam artist he is.

542
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,719
How did things
get so messed up
between us?

543
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,688
                  We used to be
         like Dipper and Mabel.

544
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,690
       The world's about to end
  and they still work together.

545
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,459
      How do they do it?
     Easy. They're kids.

546
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,661
They don't know any better.

547
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,796
 Whoa, where you goin'?

548
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,664
                 I'm gonna play
    the only card we have left.

549
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,600
          Let Bill into my mind.

550
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,602
                  He'll be able
       to take over the galaxy,

551
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,803
           and maybe even worse,

552
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,339
        but at least he <i> might </i>
             let the kids free.

553
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,707
What?! Are you kiddin' me?!

554
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,443
Are you honestly telling me
there's nothing else we can do?!

555
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,811
            Bill's only weak
            in the mind space.

556
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,813
If I didn't have this darn plate
in my head,

557
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,482
        we could just erase him
            with the memory gun

558
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,451
             when he steps
             inside my mind.

559
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,819
 What if he goes
 into <i> my </i> mind?

560
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,555
     My brain isn't good
        for anything.
         ( chuckles )

561
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,558
   There's nothing in your mind
   he wants. It <i> has </i> to be me.

562
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,460
       We need to take his deal.

563
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,662
              It's the only way
            he'll agree to save
              you and the kids.

564
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,398
Do you really think
he's gonna make good
on that deal?

565
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,500
              What other choice
                    do we have?

566
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,670
            Aaah!
            Aaah!

567
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,640
  DIPPER: I'm starting to think
    there's no way out of here.

568
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,675
  Like Grunkle Stan always says,

569
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,477
           when one door closes,

570
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,479
        choose a nearby wall
        and bash it in

571
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,647
       with brute force!

572

              Aaaaah!

574
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,586
 Ha! Now let's round up
 the townsfolk,

575
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,488
 and together
 we can defeat--

576

578

       take us alive, monsters!

579

00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,424
       It's all gone.

661
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,560
         Stan has no idea,
         but he did it.

662
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,428
He saved the world.

663
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,696
     He saved me.

664
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,835
  You're our hero, Stanley.
         ( sniffles )

665
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,405

 Hey, this is a real nice place
                   ya got here.

668
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,503
             It's <i> your </i> place,
             Grunkle Stan.

669
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,639
    Don't you remember?
    Even a little?

670
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,508
     Nope, but this chair
hugs my butt like it remembers.

671
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,410
              Ah.

672
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,847
    Hey, why the long faces?

673
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,849
      You guys look like
   it's someone's funeral.

674
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,851
      Who's that big guy
    crying in the corner?

675
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,620
          ( sobbing )

676
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,855
            We saved the world,
          but what's the point?

677
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,491
                 Grunkle Stan's
           not himself anymore.

678
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,494
       There's gotta be
       something we can
    do to jog his memory!

679
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,464
                   There isn't.
                     I'm sorry.
                   Stan's gone.

680
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,766
    I <i> know </i> my Grunkle is
     in there somewhere!

681
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,501
       There's gotta be
    something around here

682
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,769
        that can help
       bring him back!

683
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,508
                  This'll work!
              This has to work!

684
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,911
 Here's the first day we came
to Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan.

685
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,648
    And here's a macaroni
interpretation of my emotions.

686
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,753
That time
we went fishing.

687
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,355
That Summerween
we spent together.

688
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,757
Don't you remember
anything?

689
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,359
  I'm sorry. I don't know
  what this is

690
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,794
    or who you are or--gah!

691
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,362
       Quit it, Waddles!

692
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,597
    I'm trying to remember
        my life story!

693
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,798
  What did you say?

694
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,667
 I said get Waddles off of me!

695
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,835
        It's working!
        Keep reading!

He needs to remember
our boss-employee
relationship.

698
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,408
Hey! Just cause I have amnesia,

699
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,809
   don't go tryin' to give
   yourself a raise, Soos.

700
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,544
It's happening!
Keep going!

701
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,712
                OK. OK!

702

                      "Day Two.
      Grunkle Stan smells weird

703
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,383
          but we're
          starting to bond.

704
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,786
   He told us a lot about being
      a businessman in the '80s

705
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,388
          and seemed happy when
        we pretended to listen.

706
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,856
       He also gave me
       a grappling hook

707
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,725
             which everyone
             is impressed by.

708
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,393
And in more important news,

709
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,395

        Dude, make a wish, dawg!

774
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,647
        Ya know, on my
       first day here,

775
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:36,316
     if you had asked me
        what I wanted,
      I would have said

779
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,658
         I have everything

    If I had only one wish,

781
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,261
  it would be to shrink all
   of you with a shrink ray

782
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:49,629
      and bring you home
    with us in my pocket.

783
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:51,198

00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:26,199
    Samey,
    but differenty.

796
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,367
PACIFICA: Hey, you two.

797
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,269
      When are you gonna
 open your presents already?

798
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:31,404
 I broke a nail wrapping them.

799
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,639
            Ha ha!
          Pacifica.

800
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,211
                Stanley, I need
                to talk to you.

801
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:40,313
  I didn't want to say anything
       with everyone listening,

802
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,215
        but we've got
          a problem.

803
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,184
        Weirdmageddon
     has been contained,

804
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:46,353
              but I'm detecting
     some strange new anomalies

805
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,387
          near the Arctic Ocean.

806
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,622
    I want to go investigate it,

807
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,458
    but I think I might be
   too old to go it alone.

808
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,627
 Are you sayin' you
 need someone to help you

809
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,496
 sail around the world
 on the adventure
 of a lifetime?

810
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,200
 I don't just want <i> someone </i>
  to come with me, Stanley.

811
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:01,368
          I want it to be you.

812
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,370
       Will you give me
       a second chance?

813
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:06,473
You think we'll find treasure?
          And babes?

814
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:09,309
            Ha! I'd say there's
            a high probability!

815
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:11,278
          But what should we do
        with the Mystery Shack?

816
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,214
I think the town's
had enough mystery
for one lifetime.

817
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,383
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

818
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:19,252
       ( Stan, Ford whispering )

819
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,221
       ( bell ringing )
   GRUNKLE STAN: Everyone,

820
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:22,422
    I have an announcement
           to make.

821
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:25,225
   Me and my--heh!--
   nerdy bro over here

822
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,560
have some catchin' up to do,
we're gonna be away for a while.

823
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:31,264
 That's why I'm shutting down
 the Mystery Shack for good!

824
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:33,633
          ( all gasp )

825
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,469
 You shut down
 your <i> mouth </i> for good!

826
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,472
I'm sorry, Mr. Pineses,

827
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,242
 it's just that this shack
 is the most magical place
 on earth.

828
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,476
  Sure, the attractions
  are all fake,

829
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,378
but <i> dreams </i> aren't fake.

830
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,180
   Like this mermaid:

831
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:49,516
It's not just a dead fish butt
  sewn to a monkey carcass,

832
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,318
it's a marvelous creature

833
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,520
that makes us believe
that anything is possible.

834
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,523
  You shut down this shack,
and you shut down our dreams!

835
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,226
At least... <i> my </i> dreams.

836
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,461
            ALL: Aw.

837
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,497
      ( sighs ) I'm sorry, Soos,

838
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,467
       it's just there's no one
              around to run it.

839
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,569
    At least there <i> wouldn't </i> be

840
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,472
         if I hadn't just found
       the perfect replacement.

841
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:19,212
          Ladies and gentlemen,
              the Mystery Shack
       is under new management!

842
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,347
         ( all cheer )

843
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,582
 You...you mean it,
 Mister Mystery?

844
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,517
     You're Mister Mystery now,
                          Soos.

845
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,253
       Try not to burn
       the place down.

846
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,289
   I'll move in immediately.

847
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:30,357
               ( truck beeping )

848
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,592
        ( all cheering )

849
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:39,199
       ( birds chirping )

850
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,379
     Do you <i> really </i>
     have to go?

851
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,381
 There is still so much
 we haven't done together.

852
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,349
             Summer's over,
             Candy.

853
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:58,385
           It's time for us
           to grow up.

854
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,153
            But not
         <i> too </i> much.

855
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:03,356
Aaah! I hate my dumb heart
for making me feel things!

856
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,492
  Cut. It. Out. Heart!

857
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,460
Hey, can you punch
my heart too?

858
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:10,430
                      No, mine!
      Punch <i> my </i> feelings away!

859
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:14,167
           Candy and Grenda,

860
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,202
            thank you for
            being my people.

861
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:18,571
       You'll always be
       my best friends.

862
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,142
                  Grunkle Stan,
             thanks for wearing
            my Goodbye sweater.

863
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,377
     Ah, it's cold out.
     I had to.

864
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,579
What? But it's, like,
eighty-something degrees
out today.

865
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,214
          BOTH: Can it, Soos!

866
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,483
         ( all laugh )

867
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,189
     Hey. You mean a lot to me,
                           man.

868
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:38,191
      You too.

869
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,363
              Something to
              remember me by.

870
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,498
              Oh, and this.

871
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,168
          Read it the next time
        you miss Gravity Falls.

872
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,574
Last bus leaving Gravity Falls.

873
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,643
          All aboard.

874
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:59,412
    Guess we said goodbye
    to everyone except...

875
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,481
          Waddles.

876
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:05,618
                 I...don't know
           how to explain this,
                         but...

877
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,622
       Mom and Dad won't let me
               bring a pig home
           to California, so...

878
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,358
          you have to stay here!

879
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,261
          ( squeals )

880
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,331
               Come on, come on!

881
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:20,200
                I have to <i> go.</i>

882
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:22,235
       I'm...I'm sorry, Waddles!

883
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:25,438
   You know what? Forget it!

884
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,340
   I lived with this pig
   all summer,

885
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:29,342
    now <i> your </i> parents
    are gonna have to!

886
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,277
     Hey, bus guy!

887
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:32,679
    This pig is coming
    with the kids!

888
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,447
         Now, hold on a second.

889
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:36,282
        Bringing animals aboard
               a moving vehicle

890
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:37,417
         is strictly prohibited
                           by--

891
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:43,490
     Wah-- Welcome aboard.

892
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,458
        You can sit in
     the front row, pig.

893
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:51,397
Kids, you knuckleheads
were nothin' but a nuisance

894
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,266
and I'm glad to be rid of ya.

895
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,705
  We'll miss you too,
  Grunkle Stan.

896
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:07,247
           Ready to head
           into the unknown?

897
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:08,581
        Nope.

898
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:10,550
        Let's do it.

899
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:25,198
   ( all shouting farewells )

900
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,467
     Bye! Bye, everybody!
   I'll miss you guys too!

901
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,203
          SOOS: Bye, dudes! Bye!

902
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,549
