- What is it?
- Can we keep it?

Kill it, kill it!

Great. Now get it outta here.

Grunkle Ford, do you
need any help with that?

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,499
I've read all about these
creatures in your journal,

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,420
- and I think I know...
- No! I'm sorry, Dipper.

18
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:03,341
On the dark, weird road I travel,
I'm afraid you cannot follow.

Well, call me for dinner.
[beeps]

Maybe next time then?
Or not.

21
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:17,739
- Or never.
- Oh, Dipper, don't take it so hard.

22
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,992
No, do take it hard.
Take it hard and serious.

23
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,194
My brother is a
dangerous know-it-all

24
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,112
and the stuff he's
messing with is even worse.

25
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:27,448
Do yourself a favor and stay
away from him, you hear me?

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,450
But Grunkle Stan, all summer long,

27
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:31,419
I've wanted to know who the
author of the journal was.

28
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:35,122
Now the guy lives in our basement,
and I can't even talk to him.

29
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,174
Don't worry about
what's on the basement.

30
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,960
- You belong up here with me and Mabel.
- Yeah!

31
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:44,015
Besides, the season finale
of Duck-tective is airing this Friday.

32
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,217
That's all the mystery
you need this week.

33
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:49,970
Come on, quack with us, Dipper.
Quack, quack, quack.

Dear Mom and Dad,

42
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,988
we've been in Gravity
Falls for a few months,

43
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,106
and so much has happened.

44
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:51,593
Just yesterday, gravity
reversed itself, almost destroyed

45
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:55,029
the universe, and totally
wrecking the whole town.

<i>Well, they say it was an earthquake,
but you know what I think?</i>

Grunkle Stan's twin brother
came out of this portal thingy.

Dogs. Dogs with hats!

59
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,037
No. It's my favorite
fantasy-talking, level-counting,

60
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,990
statistics and graph-paper
involving game of all time:

61
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,876
Dungeons, Dungeons, 
and More Dungeons!

62
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,913
- You wanna play it with me?
- Well, I do like unicorns,

63
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,832
and that hot elf looks promising.

64
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,917
- How do you play?
- The rules are simple.

65
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,862
First, you roll a 38-sided
die to determine the level

66
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:55,756
of each player's statistical
analysis power orb.

67
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,809
These orbs relate
directly to the amount of

68
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,811
power quadrants that your
tem has dominion over,

69
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:02,814
which is inverse to the anti-quadrants
in your quadrant satchel.

70
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,017
- And then we ride unicorns?
- Yes! [gasps]

71
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,456
And no.

72
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,739
First, we make a graph.

73
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,775
[groans]
This is like Homework the Game.

74
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,078
Come on, Mabel. I need at
least two people to play.

75
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:22,510
Oh, wow, would you look at that?
Two people!

76
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:25,953
Hey, Soos, up for a little
game of D & D & More D?

77
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:29,790

that pen-and-paper kinda stuff.

78

00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,960

- Never, Paladin Radmaster.

that's mostly math and writing

88

and isn't anything like
the picture on the box?

89
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:59,820
Yes, it is! You wanna
play with me, Grunkle Stan?

90
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:03,875
Ha! Look, kid, I prefer to
do my dice rolling in Vegas.

91
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,877
Besides, only a game designed by nerds

92
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,746
would have "Charisma"
as a fantasy power.

Check this out:
"When facing yon adversaries,

- Ha ha, say it again.

95
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,006

for someone to play with me.

122

dark times, those '90s.

155
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,504
Yeesh. Sounds like a good time to
be stuck between dimensions.

156
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,640
Great-uncle Ford, I've
been meaning to ask you.

157
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,759
Where were you before you
came out of that machine,

158
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,561
and what have you been doing down here?

159
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,513
Are you working on something
behind that curtain?

160
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,850
Dipper, it's best if you and the family
stay away from that subject.

161
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,687
Honestly, I'm not sure any of
you could handle the real answer.

162
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,689
- But I could handle it.
- Ah-ah!

163
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,775
But I can show you a little something
I brought back with me.

164
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:55,583
- An infinity-sided die.
- Whoa!

165
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,669
That's so cool... and impossible.

166
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,505
These things are outlawed
in 9,000 dimensions.

167
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,542
You wanna know why?
Look at those symbols.

168
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:07,595
<i>Infinite sides means infinite outcomes.</i>

169
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:11,799
If I rolled it, anything could happen.
Our faces could melt into jelly.

170
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,634
The world could turn into an egg.

171
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:16,387
Or you could just roll an eight.
Who knows?

172
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,724
That's why I have to keep it in
this protective cheap plastic case.

173
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,611
Now, back to the game.
You've got Probabilitor on the ropes.

174
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,650
<i>[Dipper] Oh, man.</i>

175
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,787
<i>Then if I have a Dragon here,
and then a plus-three fire...</i>

176
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:37,408
Dipper, are you gonna go to sleep?
You've been saying dork words for hours.

177
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,827
Sorry, Mabel.
I gotta finish this dungeon.

178
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,796
It's gonna totally stump
Great-uncle Ford tomorrow.

179
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,831
I can't wait to see
the look on his face!

180
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:47,885
You're, uh, spending a lot of
time with old Fordsie lately, huh?

181
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,589
You have no idea.
I knew the author must be cool,

182
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,424
but he's better than I imagined!

183
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,426
And he doesn't make
fun of me all the time,

184
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,813
- the way you and Grunkle Stan do.
- Give him time.

185
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,515
Hi-oh!
[chuckles]

186
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,200
Nah, you got me.

187
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:07,438
You got me.

188
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,442
Thanks for coming
over to watch tonight's

189
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,444
Duck-tective finale, Grenda.

190
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,747
Of course. I'm so invested in
the life of these characters.

191
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,668
Hey, hey, look at you.
Someone's all dressed up.

192
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,287
It's a big night. I think
we all remember where

193
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,873
we were when we learned
Duck-tective was shot.

194
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:30,461
[clock strikes]
[gasps] Viewing positions, everyone!

195
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,230
[all gasp]

196
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,766
Ahh! Graph paper.
Kill it, kill it!

197
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,719
Dipper, could you maybe
move this to another room?

198
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,689
No dice.
We ran out of room in the basement

199
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,775
and we're going for a world record.
Now dice!

200
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,560
<i>Thirty-two!</i>

201
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:49,780
- Yes! 7,000 points damage.
- You got me.

202
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,782
Ohh! Why with this?

203
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,701
Wanna break a record, Ford?

204
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,870
You already got it for
world's nerdiest old man.

205
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:58,789
Hey, at least I'm not all
keyed up to watch a kids' show.

206
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,826
I'll have you know that
Duck-tective has a big mystery

207
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,829
element, and a lot of humor
that goes over kids' heads.

208
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,666
I don't get a lot of it, but I
like animals in human situation.

209
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,668
Grunkle Stan, it
starts in a few minutes.

210
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,589
Move that and pay the price.

211
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,842
Oh, what, 50 magical dwarf dollars?

212
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,644
Don't mock our fantastical
monetary system!

213
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,646
I'll mock all I want.
It's my TV room.

214
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,432
It's my house! You...

215
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,485
[sighs] Listen, Stanley,
did it ever occur to you

216
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,854
that if you joined us, you
might actually have fun?

217
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:31,689
What? Now you listen to me.

218
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,824
As long as I live, I will never...

219
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,576
- Grunkle Stan, wait!
- ever...

220
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,262
- Stanley!
- play your smarty-pants nerd game.

221
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,079
No!

222
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:50,624
Mortals of Dimension
46 Apostrophe Backflash.

223
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,565
Kneel before me and...

224
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,797
Snivel.

225
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:01,719
I am Probabilitor,
the greatest wizard in all mathology,

226
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,723
- give or take an error of 0.4.
- Uh. Is this normal?

227
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,559
Have you come to send us
on the quest of a lifetime,

228
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,394
because we're the smartest
players you've ever met?

229
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:13,531
You are the smartest
players I've ever met.

230
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,700
That's why I'm going to eat your
brains, to gain your intelligence.

231
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,785
It's what I do.

232
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:20,571
- It's his thing.
- What?!

233
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,740
Seize them!

234
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,626
Your math is no match
for my gun, you idiot.

235
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,518
Math ray!

236
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,661
I'm not here to play games.

237
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:36,812
<i>Now to the forest for the ultimate game.</i>

238
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:44,249
So the room's free now.

239
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,228
Who wants to watch Duck-tective?
[squeaks]

240
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:50,713
Nobody?
More couch for Grenda.

241
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,434
Oh, no. 
That crazy wizard is gonna eat

242
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:57,121
our brother's brain.
We have to stop him!

243
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,924
Maybe let him get a couple of
bites in Ford's brain first.

244
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,959
Even things out, smartness-wise.

245
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,295
- Grunkle Stan!
- All right, all right.

246
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:08,098
I guess if we have no other choice,
we'll go on a... [sighs]

247
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,967
epic wizard quest.

248
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,477
[cheering]

249
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,743
Everyone grab a weapon.

250
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,025
Nice.

251
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:23,948
We're coming for you, Dipper.
And Great-uncle Ford.

252
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:27,660
And possibly that hot elf,
if he's got anything to do with this.

253
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:32,990
[laughing]

254
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:38,329
With each brain I eat,
I shall increase my enchant-elligence.

255
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,216
If my hands were free,
I'd break every part of your face.

256
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,971
The time has come.
Hot elf, ready the brain-cooking pot.

257
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,036
Uh, yes, Probabilitor.

258
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,473
[slap]
We must be getting close.

259
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,391
These fairy bites are
getting more frequent.

260
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:07,060
<i>Hey, look, listen.</i>

261
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:11,281
Halt! 
You interlopers are trespassing

262
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,067
on the ancient forest
of Probabilitor the Wizard.

263
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,319
If ye wish to pass,

264
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,123
first ye must complete
seven unworldly quests,

265
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:22,516
- each more difficult than the last...
- No!

266
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,496
Is he... dead?

267
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,332
He's magic, sweetie.
I'm sure he's fine.

268
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,877
There's no cops in the forest.
We take this to our graves.

269
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,505
[laughing]

270
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,057
- What do we do, what do we do?
- Stop thinking, Dipper.

271
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:40,310
The more wrinkled your brain gets,
the more he'll wanna eat it.

272
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,513
And now, a little math problem.

273
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:45,516
When I subtract your
brain from your skull,

274
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:49,520
add salt and divide your family,
what's the remainder?

275
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,488
<i>[Mabel] Your butt!</i>

276
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,159
What? My butt isn't part
of this particular equation.

277
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,443
[all roaring]

278
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:59,869
Drat! How did you make
it past my one guard?!

279
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:04,418
Very well. There's only one
way your family can save you.

280
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:07,287
<i>You must defeat me</i>

281
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,207
in Dungeons, Dungeons,
And More Dungeons,

282
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,342
<i>[echoing] real life edition!</i>

283
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:16,046
[maniacal laughter]

284
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:21,051
- What? Oh, come on.
- I choose my characters versus...

285
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,354
[gasping]
yours.

286
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,225
Oh, my ears.
They're so pointy.

287
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:31,253
There better be something
protective under this tunic.

288
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:34,364
- Oh, no, there isn't.
- Seriously?

289
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,366
Can't we just, like,
arm wrestle or something?

290
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,402
Come on, this game is a lot of fun.

291
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:41,071
I had my mom pack me a lunch.

292
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,373
Ew, apple slices?
I'll eat you last.

293
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:46,736
Just make with the rules, ugly.

294
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,246
The game is a battle royale.

295
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,466
We help our characters by casting spells
determined by rolls of the dice.

296
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,552
<i>If you win, I go back
to my own dimension.</i>

297
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,339
But if I win, I eat their brains.

298
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,058
Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good...

299
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,426
- Deal!
- Oh, boy.

300
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:05,429
Let the game begin!

301
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,692
Attack!
[war cry]

302
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:16,406
What do we do?
 What are our moves?

303
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,870
There are no moves.
You make them up.

304
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:22,195
- What? Really?
- Yes. I tried to tell you.

305
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,033
<i>This game involves math, but
also risk and imagination.</i>

306
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,168
- Risk!
- Imagination?!

307
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:31,780
Grunkle Stan, make something up.
It's just like lying.

308
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,124
I cast... uh...

309
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,125
[groans]

310
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,975
shield of shielding.

311
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:45,102
- Ha! We're doin' it.
- Shield of shielding reversal spell.

312
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,190
I cast giggle time bouncy boots.

313
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:53,646
[laughing]

314
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,063
Fat flame-y sword.

315
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,231
Super-hot flame-y sword!

316
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,204
[gasps] 
No!

317
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,456
Drat you. You'll never outrun my...

318
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:12,269
<i>Ogre-nado.
It is what it sounds like!</i>

319
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:19,625
I cast Centaur-taur!
Yah!

320
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,141
[neighs]

321
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,227
Mabel, I am so confused
and so proud right now.

322
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,400
[cheering]

323
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,709
- Yes!
- Ha ha! Yes!

324
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:53,755
Ha ha ha, yes!
I was saving the worst for last.

325
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:57,309
- Oh, no.
- The Impossi-beast.

326
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,760
Hey, I thought they
banned this character.

327
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,396
Think again. 
I'm playing the controversial

328
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:04,424
1991-1992 edition.

329
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:08,520
- I'll think of some weapons.
- You don't understand.

330
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,272
This is the most powerful
monster in the game.

331
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,691
He can only be defeated
by rolling a perfect 38.

332
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,326
But the odds of that are...

333
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,695
Hey, long odds are what you want

334
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,613
when you're a world-class gambler.

335
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,333
All right, Stan, you can do this.

336
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,619
Papa needs a new pair of...
twins!

337
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:36,348
- No!!
- Sorry, nerd wizard.

338
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,634
All of your smarts are
no match for dumb luck.

339
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,155
I cast Death Muffins!

340
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,479
<i>[both] Yes!</i>

341
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,312
[laughs]

342
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:57,199
The game is, like, over.
Excelsi-whatever.

343
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,152
No!
I'm returning to my own realm.

344
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:05,959
<i>I'm turning into pure math.
What are the odds?!</i>

345
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,329
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing.

346
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,164
How did you know that you would win?

347
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,333
Hey, a gambler never
reveals his secrets.

348
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:20,088
Man, that was fun for ages eight to 80.

349
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,474
Or a million or however
old you guys are.

350
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:26,261
You know, I'm sorry for
making fun of your game, kiddo.

351
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,914
Sure, it might be too
nerdy for me, but it's just

352
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:31,516
the right amount of nerdy
for you and my brother.

353
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:35,103
And if you two wanna hang out
sometimes, I won't get in your way.

354
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:38,357
Actually, after all that,
I could use a little mindless fun.

355
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,110
Guys, we can watch the second
showing of Duck-tective!

356
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,762
It's not too late.
[squeaks]

357
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,577
<i>_</i>

358
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:53,205
<i>I just don't understand who shot you.</i>

359
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,457
<i>The only person clever
enough to defeat Duck-tective</i>

360
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:58,595
<i>is... [gasps] 
Duck-tective. Ugh.</i>

361
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,543
_

362
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,730
_

363
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,968
He had a twin brother all along?

364
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,137
That's the big twist
we were waiting for?

365
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,814
- What a rip-off!
- I predicted that, like, a year ago.

366
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:23,231
- This will be here if you ever need it.
- Really?

367
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,984
Even though I got us into
the whole game-playing mess?

368
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,036
Ah, we both got carried away.

369
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:31,373
I guess we'd both gone for
a while without a friend.

370
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,076
Dipper, can I tell you something?

371
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:38,213
You asked me earlier
what I was working on.

372
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:39,998
Well...

373
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,167
<i>I dismantled the portal.</i>

374
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:44,303
<i>An inter-dimensional
gateway is too dangerous</i>

375
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,088
<i>for the world it feeds into.</i>

376
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,057
That's why I was mad
at Stan for using it.

377
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,976
He saved me, but as I feared,

378
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,096
the instability of the
machine created this.

379
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:56,496
<i>An inter-dimensional rift.</i>

380
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,561
<i>I've contained it for now,
but it's incredibly dangerous.</i>

381
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,527
Dipper, I don't want you
to tell anyone about this.

382
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,496
Not Stan, not even your sister.

383
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,582
- Do you understand?
- Oh, of course.

384
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:09,669
In my time, I've made
many powerful enemies.

385
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,538
But I trust you with this secret.

386
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,343
Now get yourself to bed.
I have much research to do.

387
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:20,463
- Good night, Great-uncle Ford.
- Good night, Dipper.

388
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,192
Guys, do you ever think
maybe we're doin' this

389
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:38,228
'cause our lives aren't special enough?

390
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,363
That we use fantasy
as an escape to avoid

391
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:42,065
the self-improvement we all need?

392
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:45,309
That maybe we should just go out
and grow with people?

393
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:51,648
- Fortresses can't speak, darling.
- I'm a fortress. [screams]

394
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:54,294
Does anyone wanna rescue him?

395
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:56,073
- Ah, I'm tired.
- I'm fine. I'm good.

396
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,864
- Well, too bad for him.
- Long day...

397
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:02,365
