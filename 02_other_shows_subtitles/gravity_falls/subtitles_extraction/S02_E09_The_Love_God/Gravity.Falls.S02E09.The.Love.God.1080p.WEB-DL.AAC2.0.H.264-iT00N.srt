1
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,537
MABEL: Whoa!

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,239
That cloud looks
like a chipmunk.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,707
WENDY:
Barfing an airplane.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,242
( all laughing )
DIPPER: It does.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,812
THOMPSON: Uh, that cloud
looks like...uh, a cloud.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,516
LEE: Boo!
WENDY: Thompson, stop being
the worst at  <i>everything.</i>

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,851
( chuckles )
Sorry, guys.

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,152
( all laughing )

9
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,187
Look at the clouds.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,124
Ooh! That cloud looks like
a big heart-shaped balloon.

11
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,826
Clouds don't come in colors.
That  <i>is </i> a balloon.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,195
Oh, dude,
it's the Woodstick festival.

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,697
Wait.
The Wood what?

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,532
It's this annual
outdoor concert

15
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,834
featuring Oregon's
up-and-coming indie bands.

16
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,170
Hey.
They're  <i>all </i> coming.

17
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:41,807
Scarves Indoors, Wood grain
on Everything, Love God.

18
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,308
You've probably seen
him in that viral video.

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,544
<i>Who's ready</i>
<i>for love tonight?</i>

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,546
<i>Oh. Ow! Ow!</i>

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,681
<i>I hope nobody's</i>
<i>filming this.</i>

22
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,051
Whoa, like
a real  <i>concert </i> concert?

23
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,686
I've-- I've never actually
been to one of those before.

24
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,055
That's because you've never
had an awesome crew

25
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,056
to roll with before.

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,323
Come on, Thompson.

27
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,893
ALL: Lick that sponge.
Lick that sponge.

28
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,694
Oh!
I can't believe
he's doing it.

29
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,196
What is he doing?

30
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,098
When you're with us,
you're in.

31
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,102
( man moaning )

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,107
Ghosty sounds.

33
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,609
Cemetery ghosty sounds!

34
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,844
It's coming
from that open grave.

35
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,813
( moaning continues )

36
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,615
You look.
No. You look.

37
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,050
Thompson, go look.

38
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,752
Heh. Nice use of Thompson.

39
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,353
Gaze upon death.

40
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,356
ALL: Gaze upon death.
Gaze upon death.

41
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,925
Gaze upon death.

42
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,226
Gaze upon death.

43
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,594
( screaming )

44
00:01:35,596 --> 00:02:20,339
Ugh! It's even creepier
than I expected.

45
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,207
( Robbie groans )

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,378
Why did she leave me?

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,646
Robbie?

48
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,914
Wendy! Oh. Uh.

49
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,149
( nervous chuckle )

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,985
Hey, what's up?

51
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,254
Just hanging out
in this grave, you know.

52
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,856
Regular.
Regular day for me.

53
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,325
Whoa, dude, we haven't seen
you in, like, a million years.

54
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,295
You're not still mourning
our break-up, are you?

55
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,030
What? No way.

56
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,433
Robbie, we split up
forever ago.

57
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,702
It's really sweet you'd throw
yourself into a grave for me,

58
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,671
but, man, time to move on.

59
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,773
What?
I've totally moved on.

60
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,708
( cell phone rings )
♪ Wendy, I miss you so much

61
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,177
<i>♪ I'll never move on</i>

62
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,012
<i>♪ Never ever</i>

63
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,848
That was a different Wendy.
Unrelated Wendy.

64
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,917
Dude, this is getting
really awkward.

65
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,019
Yeah, the cemetery
used to be fun.

66
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,187
Now it's just depressing.

67
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,358
( sighs )

68
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,864
Wait.
You guys, he's in pain.

69
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,365
We can't just
ditch him here.

70
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,366
Come on, Mabel.

71
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,401
It's Robbie.

72
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,269
But he's suffering.

73
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,339
How can I be happy if I know
someone else is sad?

74
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,841
It totally throws off
my Happiness Chart.

75
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,080
If there's one thing
I've learned this summer,

76
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,916
it's not to get mixed up
in needless romantic drama.

77
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,119
Besides, we're finally
in with Wendy's friends.

78
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,789
With Robbie gone,
there's a good social balance.

79
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,991
Maybe we should just let
a good thing be, you know?

80
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,195
Just eat me already, man.

81
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,763
Aaah!
I was just being dramatic.

82
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,764
Quit it. Ow! Ow!

83
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,999
My face.
Vulture!

84
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,069
Oh, man.

85
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,404
I'm sorry you guys
had to see that.

86
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,006
You know,
what Robbie needs?

87
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,341
A new girl.

88
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,409
Romance is like gum.

89
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,246
Once it's lost its flavor,
you just cram another one in.

90
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:13,285
It is if you're the world's
greatest matchmaker.

91
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,854
I've never had
an unhappy customer.

92
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,422
Like Soos and Melody.

93
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,423
Watch this.

94
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,425
Walking down
some actual stairs.

95
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,326
<i>( giggles )</i>

96
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,394
Did it look cool?

97
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,395
<i>The coolest.</i>

98
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,297
Match made!

99
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,033
And then, of course,
there's Waddles and Gompers.

100
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,836
( bleating )

101
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,538
Match made.

102
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,440
That might work
for a goat and a pig,

103
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,908
but Robbie's
a hopeless case.

104
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,279
Hopeless case, e-e-e-e-eh...?

105
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,316
♪ Putting a rainbow wig

106
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,853
What the...?

107
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,322
Oh, no.
Hot air balloons.

108
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,791
Fixed gear bikes.

It's the Woodstick Festival!

112
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,602
Soos!
Lock down the Shack
and hide my shirts

113
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,171
before anyone
tie-dyes them!

114
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,339
They're slow.

115
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,840
I can probably
take a few down.

116
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,375
Wait, Mr. Pines!

117
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,177
( bird cawing )
I've been thinking.

118
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,979
Every year
this festival comes by

119
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,348
and every year you shun what
could be potential customers.

120
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,417
You really think I can
make money off of these

121
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,086
free-loading, kale-munching
freak shows?

122
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,355
You just got to figure out
what appeals to them.

123
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,525
Hmm.
How do I appeal
to young people?

124
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,565
So young people are into
hot air balloons, e-e-e-e-eh?

125
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,336
All right, Mabel.

126
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,104
Robbie's a broken teacup,

127
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,473
and you're going to
piece him back together.

128
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,376
( doorbell plays
spooky music )

129
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,511
Okay, this could get intense.

130
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,347
( gasps )

131
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,514
Howdy doo!

132
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,416
Happy day!

133
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,218
It     <i>i</i>intense!

<i>You're </i> Robbie's parents?

00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,490

136
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,992
Oh, well, he doesn't
like to talk about us.

137
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,462
He always says we're too
cheerful for funeral directors.

138
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,530
( both laughing )

139
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,165
Come in.
Come in.

140
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,169
Cracker platter?

141
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,105
Oh, no time for crackers.
Sorry.

142
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,606
I'm here
to cheer Robbie up.

143
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,942
Cannot have a dry cracker
mouth for that.

144
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,478
Robbie Stacey Valentino!

145
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,979
There's little a girl
here to see you.

146
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,447
You go on up.

147
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,182
And could you bring
him his lunch?

148
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,651
Lady, I like your style.

149
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,253
( Mabel giggles )

150
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,322
You know who would look good
in a sweater like that?

151
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,190
Mrs. Grabelson's remains!

152
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,558
Oh, absolutely!

153
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,539
Robbie, it's Mabel!

154
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,107
Who?

155
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,443
Remember me?
I'm like Girl Dipper.

156
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,078
Ugh, go away.

157
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,446
I heard a "come in."

158
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,417
Ahh! Hey!

159
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,685
Listen, kid, nobody
in the Pines family

160
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,220
is welcome here.

161
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,322
In case you forgot,
your stupid brother

162
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,991
is the one
who ruined my life!

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,262
And Mabel's the one
who's gonna fix it.

164
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:14,332
Listen, Robbie, I always used
to see you as a creepy jerk.

165
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,501
Like the human version
of rat poison.

166
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,336
Uh, go on.

167
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,472
But when I saw you
in the cemetery today,

168
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,674
I realized,
Robbie's not a bad guy.

169
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,443
He's just
a heartbroken soul

170
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,345
who needs love--
and gloves with fingers.

171
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,214
Hey, fingerless gloves
look awesome.

172
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,482
No, they don't.

173
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,351
Robbie, you just need
a good matchmaker.

174
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,554
I guarantee
I'll find you true love,

175
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,489
or twice your sadness back.

176
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,624
If I say yes,
will you leave my room?

177
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,528
I guarantee it.

178
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,399
( knuckles crack )

179
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:51,269
Okay, Gravity Falls, who wants
to go out with Robbie?

180
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:57,976
Okay.
Lazy Susan, too old.

181
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,444
Grenda, too young.

182
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,080
Multi-Bear?

183
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,416
I'm putting you
in the "maybe" pile.

184
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:08,487
Who could it be?
Who could it be?

185
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,688
( bleating )
( squealing )

186
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,089
What's that, Gompers?

187
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,424
Someone we already know?

188
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,292
But who could possibly
be superficial

189
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,094
<i>and </i> gothy enough for--

190
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,263
( squeals )
Of course, that's it!

191
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,700
You two really are America's
favorite power couple.

192
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,504
More snacks!
More snacks!

193
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,438
More snacks!

194
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,573
I'm just happy to be included.

195
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,510
Ha!
This is brilliant.

196
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,745
The perfect way to sneak cheap
snacks into the concert.

197
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,313
And it was all
Dipper's idea.

198
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,448
Whoo!
Nice.

199
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,716
Well done.
Ideas!

200
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,552
Kid, I sense greatness in you.

201
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,421
( chuckles )
Oh, well, I don't
know about--

202
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,623
Greatness!

203
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,491
All right, now,
everyone go home

204
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,059
and finish getting
ready for the concert.

205
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,495
Hey, don't wait up, Tambers.

206
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,429
Don't call me Tambers.

207
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,597
Ha-ha!

208
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,432
Classic Tambers.

209
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,569
"Tambry.
You. Me. Date.

210
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,105
"Bring that sweet,
sweet bod.

211
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,640
Your secret admirer."

212
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,380
Love is about to happen,
Lazy Susan.

213
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,614
Watch and learn.

214
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,654
Ugh!
Robbie?

215
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,389
You're my secret admirer?

216
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,790
Tambry?
Ugh!

217
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,625
This is just what I get
for trusting a toddler.

218
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,794
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

219
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,596
Dating somebody
I already know?

220
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,364
It's kind of like
admitting defeat.

221
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,166
Um, way to assume
I'm even interested.

222
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,536
If I wanted to date you,
I would have done it already.

223
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,471
I'm just a little
out of your league.

224
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,241
Don't want to waste
that bad boy.

225
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,677
Status update.

226
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,211
On blind date
with sociopath.

227
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,379
Oh, sure.
Bring out the phone.

228
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,814
Classic Tambers.

229
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,349
Hey, can I get
some chili fries?

230
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,084
To go.

231
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,219
What?
How is this possible?

232
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,455
I'm supposed to be
the best matchmaker ever.

233
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,456
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

234
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,158
Let's go.
Let's go.

235
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,394
Whoo-hoo!

236
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,397
Who's ready to fall
in love tonight?

237
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,699
ALL: Love God!

238
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,100
( all cheering )

239
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,337
That's what they call me.

240
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,172
We're rewriting
history tonight,

241
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,441
and it starts
with you and you.

242
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,512
Love is real
and it's in your face!

243
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,814
( chuckles )

244
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,183
What's your name,
you little angel?

245
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,484
( chuckles )
Meredith.

246
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,853
Meredith, Meredith,
we got a problem.

247
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,688
That cutie right there
is your soulmate

248
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,190
and you're living
without him.

249
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,424
Oh, no.

250
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,427
Get it, girl.
You know what you love.

251
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,363
Pow!
Match made!

252
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,331
Ha-ha!

253
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,734
I must know how this works!

254
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,403
Hi.
Love God?

255
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,904
Mabel here.
Big fan.

256
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,507
Can I just say, that was some
of the finest matchmaking

257
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,842
I've ever seen?

258
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,645
Can you please, please,
please tell me your secret?

259
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,714
Well, between you and me,
let's just say,

260
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,417
my name's not exactly
a coincidence.

261
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,654
Oh. My. Love God.

262
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,622
Are you an actual Love God?

263
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,491
Call me a cherub.

264
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,559
The Internet pretty much does
my job for me nowadays,

265
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,828
so I've taken some time
to focus on my rock career.

266
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,863
Boom.
Cassette.

267
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,464
Boom.
For you.

268
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,335
Oh!
That's...great.

269
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,737
So anyway, can you make
anything fall in love?

270
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,639
Like that snake
and that badger?

271
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,941
( hissing and growling )

272
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,244
Hmm.
Ah, gee, I don't know.

273
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,545
That might be
kind of hard to--

274
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,313
Ka-boom!
Match made!

275
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,752
They're gonna
make a snadger.

276
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,320
How you doing that?

277
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,356
Love potion, yo.
I got it all.

278
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,292
Summer love,
young love, anti-love.

279
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,295
You just got to put a little
on your fingers and pow!

280
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,463
I need that potion.

281
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,731
How much would it cost?

282
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,633
Um, would you accept
squirrels as payment?

283
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,268
Whoa-oh-oh!

284
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,438
You might think you know
what's best for people,

285
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,340
but this stuff can have
major social consequences.

286
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,943
That's why it can only be
used by a serious expert.

287
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,244
Love God!

288
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,479
Sign my face.

289
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,648
Only if you sign mine, baby.
Let's get weird!

290
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,650
( squeaks )

291
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,460
Mind if I add a little
something to these fries?

292
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,928
I don't see why not.

293
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,305
Whoa!
Did your whole thing suddenly
get a lot more likeable?

294
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,509
You don't seem as needy
as I used to think you were.

295
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,245
Hey, you wouldn't want to
maybe get out of here and,

296
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,848
I don't know, go kiss
in public a lot?

297
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,850
For some reason, I do.

298
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,384
Status update.

299
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,454
You know what?
Forget it.

300
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,689
Maybe I should stare
at something

301
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,390
other than my phone
for a while.

302
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,861
Match made!

303
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,431
All right, who's ready
for the best

304
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,867
and most overpriced
day of our summer?

305
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,535
Whoo-hoo!
Yay!
All right!

306
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,604
I brought a baggie
of trail mix

307
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,540
and safety whistles
in case we get separated.

308
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,908
( clears throat )
Lee.

309
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,879
This kid is a champion.

310
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,113
We're just waiting on Tambry.

311
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,948
Can't leave without Tambry.

312
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,519
Sorry, guys, but Tambry's
a little busy at the moment.

313
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,887
Wink. Wink.

314
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,588
What does that mean?
Why are you winking?

315
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,425
Let's just say she and Robbie
took a trip to Smoochville.

316
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,294
Now everyone's happy!

317
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,630
Wait. Wait.
Robbie and Tambry?

318
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,697
This can't be happening.

319
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:20,732
How's that?

320
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,966
He knew I liked her.

321
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,568
How could he do this?

322
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,004
Whoa, hold it.
You like Tambry?

323
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,072
And you told Robbie
but not me?

324
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,041
You always make
fun of my crushes, man.

325
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,043
That's what we do,
genius.

326
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,378
Oh. Oh.

327
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,846
This is so like Tambry
to do this.

328
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,514
Date my ex behind my back.

329
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,016
I'm gonna tear her
highlights out.

330
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,918
Guys! Guys! Calm down.

331
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,952
We're gonna be late
for the concert.

332
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,720
Uh, news flash, kid.

333
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,955
I'm not going to the concert.

334
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,557
Not with him.

335
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,791
Hey, that won't be a problem
'cause I'm out.

336
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,059
Me, too.

337
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,328
Wait! Wait!
This group is all I have!

338
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,963
Don't make me go back
to having no friends!

339
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,565
Guys!

340
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,466
Match...made?

341
00:13:55,468 --> 00:14:01,806
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Not my mailbox!

342
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,775
( grunts ) Ow!

343
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,377
( growls )
What did you just do?!

344
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,079
I've let these guys
pick on me for years

345
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,447
to keep this group together.

346
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,749
And now they've
totally fallen apart.

347
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,018
But we were all starting
to finally hang out together.

348
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,856
Well, unless you can break up
Robbie and Tambry immediately,

349
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,457
there is no gang.

350
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,692
I have no more friends.

351
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,561
And neither do you.
I'm gonna eat this.

352
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,531
Mabel, what did I tell you

353
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,666
about staying out
of Robbie's personal life?

354
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,134
I know. I know!

355
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,503
I just wanted to be
a good matchmaker.

356
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,006
I never should have gotten
love potion from the Love God.

357
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,774
Wait, love potion?

358
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,544
If you did a spell,
then can't you, like, undo it?

359
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,412
( gasps )
That's it!

360
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,480
If I undo the spell,

361
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,582
then everyone
will be friends again.

362
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,517
But I'm gonna
need your help.

363
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,653
Also, you are  <i>not</i>
<i>pulling off that V-neck.</i>

364
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,687
I know.

365
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,855
Burn it!

366
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,491
Oho! Ha! Ha!

367
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,530
Balloon faster, Soos!

368
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,999
We need this thing
up in the air

369
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,533
before the festival ends.

370
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,968
Are you sure that
that open flame should be

371
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,570
that close to that dangling
cloth and rope?

372
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,405
I'm sure about everything.

373
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,507
Now lube up those engine gears
with some kerosene.

374
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,009
More kerosene!

375
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,415
Unh! Come back, guys!
Come on.

376
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,184
The tickets were 100 bucks.
I sold my watch.

377
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,853
You got to come
to the concert.

378
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,421
Ew, and have
to look at that?

379
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,622
No, thanks.

380
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,460
Ugh, they're doing
that couple hug-walk.

381
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,662
Guys, you're in public.

382
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,763
People can see you.

383
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,064
Dipper.
Come on.

384
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,201
Love God.
Sound check for Love God.

385
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,836
Ow!

386
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,571
Let's make some
miracles happen.

387
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,440
Groupies, bed-head me.

388
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,875
( chuckles )

389
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,543
Love God's about
to get crazy.

390
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,978
Whoa.
Hey, all right.

391
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,682
Now's our chance.

392
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,518
Here we go.
Let's see.

393
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,088
Puppy love, inter-species love,
love of country music.

394
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,189
Ew.

395
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,024
Oh!
Anti-love.

396
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,260
To reverse the effects
of love potion,

397
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,563
simply spray on your victim
and watch their heart die
on the inside.

398
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,497
Sounds good to me.

399
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,466
Hey!

400
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,635
You're the one who's
been stealing my stuff.

401
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,236
I am  <i>not </i> loving this.

402
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm sorry.
But I made a mistake
and I have to fix it.

403
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,241
Kid, I tried to tell you.

404
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,143
This stuff is way
too dangerous.

405
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,512
On my oath as a God,
I cannot let you--

406
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,580
Oh, hey,
where did you just go?

407
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,815
I'm sorry, Love God!

408
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,249
But it's for the good
of my friends!

409
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,584
Come back here!

410
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,653
( panting )

411
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,721
Dipper, catch!

412
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,125
( audience cheers )

413
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,893
♪

414
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,096
Get those kids!

415
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,531
ALL: Halt!

416
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,034
We  <i>mustache </i> you to move!

417
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,136
Good one.

418
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,537
( crowd cheering )

419
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,274
Ooh!
Thank you.

420
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,976
Aagh!

421
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,178
No, no, no, everyone's
touching everything!

422
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,080
Give me back the potion!

423
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,248
Oh, hey, what's up?

424
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,282
Here, have a cassette.

425
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,555
Dang it.
Fly, tiny wings.

426
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,057
Get up there.
Oh!

427
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,792
I haven't had to use
these in a long time.

428
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,265
Dipper. Look.

429
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,767
( camera clicks )

430
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,171
Just one clean shot
to the back of their heads

431
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,639
and everything's fixed.

432
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,010
Sorry, kids, but you've
left me no choice.

433
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,179
Visions of heartbreak past!

434
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,016
We're back, Mabel.

435
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,018
We like you now.

436
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,588
Yes. Definitely. Absolutely.

437
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,557
Ha! You really think
we'd fall for that?

438
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,725
( Mabel giggles )

439
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,927
Sure  you can all marry me!

440
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,929
Oh! Guy from the $10 bill.

441
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,031
I forgot
I had a crush on you.

442
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,000
Dang it, Mabel.
They're not real.

443
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,768
Just give us
the bottle, Mabel.

444
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,304
Mabel, don't!

445
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,872
It's finally done.

446
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,240
When these idiots
see this balloon,

447
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,942
they'll understand
that I love young people.

448
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,611
"I heart kids."

449
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,413
All right, let 'er rip.

450
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,316
Oh. Oh, no!
A letter rip!

451
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,018
What the H?!

452
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,320
( chatter, laughter )

453
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,961
( screaming )
I eat kids?
But  <i>we're </i> kids!

454
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,262
It's heaven's
punishment

455
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,665
for our terrible
taste in everything!

456
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,906
Mommy, is the floating
head going to eat us?

457
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:29,907
Yes, Charlie!

458
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,209
Yes, he will.

459
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,315
Mabel, it's a trick!
Don't give him the...

460
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,883
Gotcha!

461
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,653
Oh!
Curse my oversized heart.

462
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,622
Sorry, kids,
but that's what happens

463
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,825
Only a greater being
from the heavens themselves

464
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,860
could possibly stop--

465
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,328
( people screaming )

466
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,063
It's coming down!

467
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,633
Whoooooa!

468
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,174
Oh, no.
I hope someone didn't die.

469
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,076
Yes,
that would be awful.

470
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,644
( both laughing )

471
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,079
What's everybody
crying about?

472
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,281
In my day, zeppelins fell
from the sky like raindrops.

473
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,883
It's him!

474
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,918
The horrible old man
from the sky!

475
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,786
( people shrieking )

476
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,423
You know what?

477
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,392
Being loved
by the youth is overrated.

478
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,761
Being feared?
Now that's priceless.

479
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,197
Love God, are you okay?

480
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,899
Please be immortal.
Please be immortal.

481
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,867
( gasps )

482
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,670
Dude.
I am so over this!

483
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,005
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Love God to the stage.</i>

484
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,673
<i>Love God to the stage.</i>

485
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,808
Aagh!
Look, kid, take it, okay?

486
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,310
Spray everyone
for all I care.

487
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,012
You want to mess
with people's lives?

488
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,346
You want to play God?

489
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,881
Do it.
'Cause I'm sick of it.

490
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,752
Medic, I need--
I need onion rings!

491
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,754
( band playing )

492
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,389
Okay, Mabel,
now's our chance.

493
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,424
They break up and the whole
friend group gets back together.

494
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,930
Mabel!

495
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,899
Mabel, I just wanted
to thank you.

496
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,302
I've been so miserable
since Wendy broke up with me

497
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,270
that I thought
my life was over.

498
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,838
But you were right.

499
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,307
I just needed to move on.

500
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,245
I'm...happy?
Weird, huh?

501
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,981
TAMBRY: Robbie, people are
commenting on our pictures.

502
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,720
Dipper, maybe
we shouldn't do this.

503
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,823
I mean, every time we've
played with people's fates,

504
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,059
it's only made
things worse.

505
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,761
They are kind of perfect
for each other,

506
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,496
in a gross kind of way.

507
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,332
But what about
our friend group?

508
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,834
Well, maybe it'll
sort itself out.

509
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,836
I mean, there's
got to be something

510
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,005
that could bring everyone
back together.

511
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,474
Guys, I made
a friendship cake.

512
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,109
So let's all get
over this, okay?

513
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,411
My cake!

514
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,350
Hey!
Food from the outside!

515
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,317
Ohhhh!

516
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,518
Get him!

517
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,454
Who!
Hey, look.

518
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,855
Is that Thompson?

519
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,857
( whistle blowing )

520
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,192
( all laughing )
Oh, man.

521
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,827
Yeah, fight the machine,
Thompson!

522
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,296
Throw snacks at 'em.
Use jerky as a weapon.

523
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,464
Thompson!

524
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,798
ALL: Thompson!
Thompson!

525
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,433
Thompson!
Thompson!

526
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,469
Thompson!
Thompson!

527
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,271
Thompson!
Thompson!

528
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,172
Thompson!
Thompson!

529
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,108
Thompson!
Thompson!

530
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,843
Thompson!
Thompson...

531
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:30,087
I think everything
just might be all right.

532
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,357
Maybe someone up there really
<i>is </i> a genius matchmaker.

533
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,959
All according to plan.

534
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,193
