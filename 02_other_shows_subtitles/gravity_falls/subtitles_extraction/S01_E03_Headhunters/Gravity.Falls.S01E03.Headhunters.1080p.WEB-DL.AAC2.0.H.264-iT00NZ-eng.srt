1
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:11,190
<i>I'm afraid your services
won't be required here, sir.</i>

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,271
<i>My men have examined
the evidence,</i>

3
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:15,225
<i>and this is obviously
an accident.</i>

4
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:21,858
<i>What?!</i>

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,862
<i>Duck-tective will return
after these messages.</i>

6
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:28,753
That duck is a genius.

7
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:30,842
Eh. It's easier to find clues
when you're that close
to the ground.

8
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:33,853
Are you saying you could
outwit duck-tective?

9
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,849
Mabel, I have very keen
powers of observation.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,849
For example,
just by smelling your breath

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,753
I can tell that
you have been eating...

12
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,820
An entire tube of toothpaste?

13
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,759
- It was so sparkly.
- Hey, dudes!

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,842
You'll never guess
what I found!

15
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,825
- Buried treasure!
- Buried...

16
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:52,837
Hey, I was gonna say that!

17
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:55,795
So I was cleaning up
when I found this secret door

18
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,795
hidden behind the wallpaper.

19
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:00,771
It's crazy-bonkers-creepy.

20
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,829
Whoa! It's a secret wax museum.

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,820
They're so life-like.

22
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:09,846
Except for that one.

23
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:11,766
Hello!

24
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,792
Ha ha! It's just me,
your Grunkle Stan!

26
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,198
Behold the Gravity Falls
Wax museum.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,280
It was one of our most
popular attractions!

28
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,318
Before I forgot all about it.

29
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,304
I got 'em all...
genghis Khan, Sherlock Holmes,

30
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:08,317
some kind of,
I don't know, Goblin Man.

31
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,338
Ooh! Is anyone else
getting the creeps here?

32
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,335
And now for
my personal favorite...

33
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,263
wax Abraham Lincoln,
right over...

34
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:17,284
oh, no! Come on!

35
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,271
Who left the blinds open?!

36
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,300
Wax John wilkes booth,
I'm lookin' in your direction.

37
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,292
How do you fix a wax figure?

38
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,275
Cheer up, Grunkle Stan.

39
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:29,305
- Where's that smile?
- Meh.

40
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:31,314
- Beep bop boop.
- Ow.

41
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:36,275
Don't worry, Grunkle Stan,
I'll make you a new wax figure
from all this old wax.

42
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:38,322
You really think you could
make one of these puppies?

43
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,321
Grunkle Stan,
I'm an arts and crafts master.

44
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:44,296
Why do you think I always have
this glue gun stuck to my arm?

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,272
- Eeech!
- I like your gumption, kid.

46
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,314
I don't know
what that word means,
but thank you.

47
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,254
Dipper.

48
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,304
What do you think
of my wax figure idea?

49
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,300
She's part fairy princess,

50
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,330
and part <i>horse </i>fairy princess.

51
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,313
Maybe you should carve
something from real life.

52
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,292
Like a waffle with big arms!

53
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,284
Yo-kay, or, ya know,
something else,

54
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,263
like someone in your family.

55
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,305
Kids! Have you
seen my pants?

56
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:16,271
O muse, you work
in mysterious ways.

57
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,326
Why is your sister
talking to the ceiling?

58
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,271
I think it needs more glitter.

59
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:36,318
Agreed.

60
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,326
I found my pants,
but now I'm missing my...

61
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,321
What do you think?

62
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:48,297
I <i>think </i>the wax museum's
back in business!

63
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,317
I can't believe
this many people
showed up.

64
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,246
I know, right?

65
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,318
Your uncle probably
bribed 'em or something.

66
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,243
He bribed me.

67
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:12,250
You all know me, folks,
town doll and Mr. Mystery.

68
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,289
Please, ladies!
Control yourselves!

69
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,304
As you know, I always bring
the people of this fair town

70
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:21,259
novelties and befuddlements,

71
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,309
the likes of which
the world has never known.

72
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,246
But enough about me.

73
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,304
Behold...

74
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,310
Me!

75
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,285
♪ Ye-ah!
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah! ♪

76
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:38,288
And now a word from
our own Mabelangelo.

77
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,309
It's Mabel.

78
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,284
Thank you for coming.

79
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:44,275
I made this sculpture
with my own two hands!

80
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:47,263
It's covered in my blood,
sweat, tears,

81
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,326
and other fluids.

82
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,310
- Ugh! - Ohh!
- Ewww!

83
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:52,246
Heh heh. Yeah.

84
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,334
I will now take questions.
You there.

85
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,263
Old man mcgucket, local kook.

86
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,305
Are the wax figures alive?
And, follow-up question,

87
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,330
can I survive
the wax man uprising?

88
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:04,313
Um... Yes! Next question.

89
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:07,263
Toby determined,
Gravity Falls gossiper.

90
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:10,280
Do you <i>really </i>think
this constitutes
a wonder of the world?

91
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,313
Your microphone's
a turkey baster, Toby.

92
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,335
- It certainly is.
- Next question.

93
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,304
Shandra jimenez,
a <i>real </i>reporter.

94
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:21,267
Your fliers promised
free pizza with admission
to this event.

95
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:22,275
Is this true?

96
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:24,285
- That's what <i>I </i>heard.
- Come on!

97
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:26,285
- What a rip-off!
- I want my pizza.

98
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,259
That was a typo.

99
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,264
Good night, everyone!

100
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:34,297
Ohhh.

101
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,267
In your face!

102
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:40,326
We're not coming back <i>here.</i>

103
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,326
I think that went well.

104
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,300
Hot pumpkin pie!
Look at all this cash!

105
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,313
And I owe it all
to one person...

106
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,296
This guy.

107
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:53,338
Ooh! Yeah, you too,
ya little gremlin.

108
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,335
Now, you kids wash up.
We got another long day
of fleecing rubes tomorrow.

109
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,259
Go! Go!

110
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,325
Ahh, kids.

111
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,309
<i>Well, duck-dective,</i>

112
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,305
<i>it seems you've really
"quacked" the case.</i>

113
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,726
Ha ha!

114
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:09,797
Stupid duck.

115
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,776
Well, I'm gonna use the John.

116
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,797
You need anything?

117
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:18,769
I love this guy!
Don't you go nowhere.

118
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,811
- Dipper, you wanna do a toothbrush race?
- Okay.

119
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:32,718
No... No... Nooooo!

120
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,811
Wax Stan! He's been...
Murdered!

121
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,719
Ohhh!

122
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,797
I got up to use the John,
right?

123
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:50,797
And when I come back,
blammo! He's headless!

124
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:54,760
My expert handcrafting
besmirched.

125
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:55,802
Besmirched!!!

126
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,810
Who would <i>do </i>something
like this?

127
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,739
What's your opinion,
sheriff blubs?

128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,776
Look, we'd love
to help you folks,

129
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:06,731
but let's face the facts...
this case is unsolvable.

130
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:08,811
- What?! You take that back, sheriff blubs!
- What? - What?

131
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,793
You're kidding, right?
There must be evidence, motives.

132
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:14,723
- Ya know, I could help, if you want.
- He's really good.

133
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,789
He figured out who was
eating our tin cans.

134
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,789
All signs pointed to the goat.

135
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,797
Yeah, yeah, let the boy help.

136
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,744
He's got a little brain
up in his head.

137
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,772
Whoo! Would you look
at what we got here!

Then we'll see who's <i>adorable.</i>

153
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,753
Aw. You sneeze
like a kitten.

154
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,873
Wax Stan has lost his head,

155

and it's up to us to find it.

156
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:12,915
There were a lot of unhappy
customers at the unveiling.

157

The murderer could
have been anyone.

Yeah! Even us!

00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,902
In this town,
anything is possible,
ghosts, zombies...

160
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,844
could be months before
we find our first clue.

161
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:24,903
Hey, look, a clue!

162
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,840
Footprints in the shag carpet.

163
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,919
That's weird.
They've got a hole in them.

164
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,929
And they're leading to...

165
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,894
So what do you think?

166
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,911
In my opinion, this is an ax.

167
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,928
Wait a minute...
the lumberjack!

168
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,869
Of course!

169
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,844
In your face!

170
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:47,920
He was furious when he
didn't get that free pizza.

171
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:50,857
Furious enough for murder!

172
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:51,912
Oh, you mean manley Dan?

173
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:54,915
He hangs out at this
crazy-intense biker joint
downtown.

174
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,897
Then <i>that's </i>where we're going.

175
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:57,914
Dude, this is awesome.

176
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,881
You two are like
the mystery twins.

177
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:00,895
Don't call us that.

178
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,919
Hey, gimme a hand
with this coffin,
will ya?

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,873
I'm doing a memorial service
for wax Stan.

180
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,919
Something small, but classy.

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,883
- Ooh!
- Sorry, Grunkle Stan,

182
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,874
- But we've got a big break in the case.
- Break in the case!

183
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:18,882
We're heading into town
right now to interrogate
the murderer.

184
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,861
We have an ax!
Ree! Ree! Ree!

185
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,936
Seems like the kind of thing
a responsible parent
wouldn't want you doing.

186
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,928
Good thing I'm an uncle.
Avenge me, kids!

187
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:30,887
Avenge me!!!

188
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:38,933
This is the place.

189
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,894
Got the fake I.D.'s?

190
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,879
Here goes nothing.

191
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,844
Sorry, but we don't
serve minors.

192
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,862
Dagnabbit!

193
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,870
We're here to interrogate
manley Dan the lumberjack

194
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:57,873
for the murder of wax Stan.

195
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:58,933
Deedle-eedle-eet.

196
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,920
Works for me.

197
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,865
He's resting.

198
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,848
All right, let's just
try to blend in, okay?

199
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,878
You got it, dipping sauce.

200
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,911
Hey, there, fellow
restaurant patron!

201
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,928
Bap!

202
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,874
Grrrr!

203
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,878
Aaaah!!!

204
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,844
Manley Dan!
Just the guy
I wanted to see.

205
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,862
- Where were you last night?
- Punchin' the clock.

206
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:33,903
You were at work?

207
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,907
No, I was <i>punchin' </i>that clock!

208
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:39,865
Ten o'clock.
The time of the murder.

209
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:42,857
So I guess you've never
seen <i>this </i>before?

210
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,874
- Listen, little girl...
- Hey, actually, I'm...

211
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,878
I wouldn't pick my teeth
with that ax!

212
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,861
It's left-handed.
I only use my right hand.

213
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,873
The manly hand!

214
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,886
Hit him!
Hit him!

215
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:54,933
- Aaaah!
- Hee hee hee!

216
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,852
Left-handed...

217
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,919
Three, four, five, six.

218
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,861
Oh! Your wife
is gonna be beautiful.

219
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:04,898
Yes!

220
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,902
Mabel, big break in the case!

221
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:08,878
But will she love me?

222
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,873
It's a left-handed ax.

223
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:11,916
These are all our suspects.

224
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,861
Manley Dan is right-handed.

225
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:16,869
That means all we gotta do
is find our left-handed suspect

226
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,887
- and we've got our killer.
- Oh, man!

227
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,928
We are on <i>fire </i>today!

228
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,869
Pazow! Pazow! Pazow!

229
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,870
Let's find that murderer.

230
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,865
Mabel! There's only
one person left
on this list!

231
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,879
Of course!
It all adds up.

232
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:06,922
You kids better
be right about this,

233
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,879
or you'll never
hear the end of it.

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,873
The evidence is irrefutable.

235
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,869
It's <i>so </i>irrefutable.

236
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,873
I'm gonna get to use
my night stick!

237
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:15,933
You ready, little fella?

238
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,895
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Whoo! Whoo!

239
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:20,844
On three.
One, two...

240
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:21,924
- Heeyaw!
- Nobody move! This is a raid!

241
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:24,920
What is this,
some kind of raid?

242
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,878
Toby determined,
you're under arrest

243
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,857
for the murder of the wax body
of Grunkle Stan!

244
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,898
You have the right
to remain impressed

245
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,861
with our awesome
detective work.

246
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:37,929
Gobbling goose feathers!

247
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,878
I don't understand!

248
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,861
Then allow me to explain.

249
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,912
<i>You were hoping
that Grunkle Stan's
new attraction</i>

250
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,936
<i>would be the story that saved
your failing newspaper.</i>

251
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,874
<i>But when the show was a flop,</i>

252
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,870
<i>you decided to go out
and make your own headline.</i>

253
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:53,922
But you were sloppy,

254
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,883
<i>and all the clues pointed to</i>

255
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,873
<i>a shabby-shoed reporter
who was caught left-handed!</i>

256
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:01,902
Toby determined,
you're yesterday's news.

257
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,915
Boy, your little knees
must be sore

258
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,869
from jumping to conclusions!

259
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,886
Ha-cha-cha!

260
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,911
I had nothing to do
with that murder.

261
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,903
- I knew it! Wait... what...?
- Huh? Could you repeat...

262
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:17,873
Then where were you
the night of the break-in?

263
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:18,908
Uh...

264
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,861
<i>Finally we can be alone,</i>

265
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:26,887
<i>cardboard cut-out of
female news reporter
shandra jimenez!</i>

266
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,845
- Ew! - Ugh!
- Yuck!

267
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,937
Time stamp confirms it.
Toby, you're off the hook,

268
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,870
- you freak of nature.
- Hurray!

269
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,870
But... but it <i>has </i>to be him!
Check the ax for fingerprints.

270
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,840
No prints at all.

271
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,055
No prints?

272
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,050
Hey, I got a headline for ya:

273
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:48,051
"City kids waste
everyone's time."

274
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:55,022
Boy, I'd be pretty embarrassed
if I was you two!

275
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,050
Kids, Zeus,

276
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,025
lifeless wax figures,

277
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:06,064
thank you all for coming.

278
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:10,038
Some people might say
that it's wrong for a man

279
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,059
to love a wax replica
of himself.

280
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,043
- They're wrong!
- Easy, Zeus.

281
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:18,059
Wax Stan, I hope
you're pickin' pockets
in wax heaven.

282
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,029
I'm sorry, I got
glitter in my eye!

283
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,017
Oh, dude!

284
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,017
Huh. Those cops
were right about me.

285
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:28,088
Dipper, we've come so far.
We can't give up now.

286
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,021
But I considered everything...

287
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:34,029
the weapon, the motive,
the clues...

288
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,017
Huh. Wax Stan's shoe
has a hole in it.

289
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,106
All the wax guys have that.

290
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:43,017
It's where the pole thingie
attaches to their
stand dealies.

291
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,084
Wait a minute!

292
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:48,021
What has holes in its shoes
and no fingerprints?

293
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,050
Mabel! The murderers are...

294
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,043
standing right behind you?

295
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,021
Wax Sherlock Holmes!

296
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,076
Wax Shakespeare!

297
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:01,035
- Wax Coolio?
- What's up, Homes?

298
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,076
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

299
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:06,953
Congratulations,
my two amateur sleuths.

300
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:09,095
You've unburied the truth!

301
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:12,109
And now we're
going to bury <i>you.</i>

302
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:19,066
Bravo, Dipper Pines!

303
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,212
You've discovered
our little secret.

304
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,305
Applaud, everyone!

305
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:25,233
Applaud sarcastically!

306
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,301
Uh, no, that sounds
too sincere.

307
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,262
Slow clap.
<i>There </i>we go.

308
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,241
Nice and condescending.

309
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,300
But how is this possible?
You're made of wax!

310
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:35,212
Are you... Magic?

311
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:38,276
Are we magic?
She wants to know
if we're magic!

312
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:43,238
- We're cursed!
- Cursed! Cursed!

313
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:46,258
Cursed to come to life
whenever the moon is waxing.

314
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,208
Your uncle bought us
many years ago
at a garage sale.

315
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,234
A <i>haunted </i>garage sale, son!

316
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:59,229
I must warn you,
these statues come
at a terrible price.

317
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,237
Twenty dollars?!
I'll just take 'em
when you're not looking.

318
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,305
- What?
- I said I was gonna rob ya.

319
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:08,216
<i>And so the mystery shack
wax collection was born.</i>

320
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,300
<i>By day we would be
the playthings of man.</i>

321
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:14,237
<i>But when your uncle was asleep,
they would rule the night.</i>

322
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:17,226
- Hey. I told you to stop that.
- Make me.

323
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,254
Huh?

324
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:25,234
<i>It was a charmed life
for us cursed beings.</i>

325
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:31,292
<i>That is, until your uncle
closed up shop.</i>

326
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:48,241
<i>We've been waiting ten years
to get our revenge on Stan</i>

327
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,255
<i>for locking us away.</i>

328
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,255
<i>But we got the wrong guy.</i>

329
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:01,258
So you were trying to
murder Grunkle Stan for <i>real?</i>

330
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,250
You were right
all along, Dipper!
Wax people <i>are </i>creepy!

331
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:08,296
Enough! Now that
you know our secret,

332
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:10,301
you must die.

333
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,241
What do we do?
What do we do?!

334
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:17,276
I don't know!

335
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,237
Aaaah!

336
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:27,251
That's it!
We can melt them with
hotty melty things!

337
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:32,220
Anyone move, and we'll
melt you into candles!

338
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,267
<i>Decorative </i>candles!

339
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:36,266
You really think
you can defeat <i>us?</i>

340
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:39,238
- It's worth a shot, I guess.
- I'm not really sure.

341
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,263
So be it. Attack!

342
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,217
Aaah!

343
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,226
Uhh! Aaah!

344
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,251
Ohh! Aaah!

345
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:53,241
Interview <i>this, </i>Larry King!

346
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,287
My neck!
My beautiful neck!

347
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,305
- Ahh!
- Joke's on you, groucho!

348
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,270
I've heard about
a cutting remark,
but this is ridiculous.

349
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,259
Hey, why is there
nothing in my hand?

350
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:09,283
Ha! Genghis Khan,
you fell harder than the...

351
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,254
Ah, I don't know, Jin Dynasty?

352
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:13,280
Yeah. All right.

353
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,271
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

354
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:20,230
- What's up with that?
- Dipper, watch out!

355
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,259
All right, let's
get this taken care of.

356
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,885
Catch!

357
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:35,888
Uh... Uh...

358
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,905
Once your family
is out of the way,

359
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:40,860
we'll rule the night
once again!

360
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:42,922
Don't count on it!

361
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,914
Come back here, you brat!

362
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,898
Uh... Oh...

363
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:58,892
You really think
you can outwit me, boy?

364
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,926
I'm Sherlock bleeding Holmes!

365
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:03,880
Have you <i>seen
</i>my magnifying glass?!

366
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:04,917
It's enormous!

367
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,889
Oohh!

368
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,913
Any last words?

369
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,892
Um...
You got any sun screen?

370
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,885
Got any... What?!

371
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:29,935
- No.
- You know, letting me lead you outside,

372
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,918
Probably not your
sharpest decision.

373
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,942
Outsmarted by a child
in short pants!

374
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,947
Noooo!

375
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:39,897
Fiddlesticks!
Humbugs!

376
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:42,859
It's a total kerfuffle!

377
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,898
What a hullaballoo!

378
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,902
Case closed.

379
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,867
Ha ha ha!
You sneeze like a kitten.

380
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,897
Those policemen were right,
you're adorable.

381
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,885
Adorable!!!

382
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,901
Eww.

00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,871

00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:04,939
- You know any limericks?
- Uh...

386
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,884
There once was
a dude from Kentucky...

387
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:08,922
- Nope.
- Aaah!

388
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,913
Dipper! You're okay!

389
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:12,938
You solved the mystery
after all.

390
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:15,867
I couldn't have done it
without my sidekick.

391
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,901
No offense, Dipper,
but you're the sidekick.

392
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:19,948
What? Says who?
Are people saying that?
Have you heard that?

393
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,921
Hot Belgian waffles!

394
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,905
What happened to my parlor?!

395
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:26,909
Your wax figures
turned out to be evil,

396
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,880
so we fought them to the death!

397
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:29,914
I decapitated Larry King.

398
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,942
Ha ha! You kids
and your imaginations.

399
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,942
On the bright side, though,
look what we found.

400
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,892
My head! Ha ha!

401
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,884
I missed this guy.

402
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:40,893
You done good, kids!

403
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,921
Line up for some
affectionate noogying.

404
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:45,863
I'm not so sure about that.
Is there any other alternative?

405
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,939
Ha ha! Noogy, noogy, noogy!

406
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,901
Solve the case yet, boy?

407
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,909
I'm so confident
you're gonna say no

408
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,877
that I'm gonna take
a long, slow sip from
my cup of coffee.

409
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,881
Actually, the answer is yes.

410
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,897
Aaaaah!

411
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:05,901
Ow!

412
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,863
Aah!

413
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,918
- It burns! It burns!
- My eyes!

414
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,905
They got scalded!

415
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,871
So, did you get rid
of <i>all </i>the wax figures?

416
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,909
I am 99% sure that I did.

417
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,877
Good enough for me.

418
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,926
Ha ha ha ha!

419
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,905
Huh?

420
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:31,909
So, you're a rat.
Tell me about that.

421
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,901
Hey! Get back here!

422
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:34,934
I'm hopping!

423
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:38,888
I'm hopping after a rat
that stole my ear!

424
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:41,859
Hmm. Hey, Dipper,

425
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,889
what do you think is better,

426
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,871
sequins or llama hair?

427
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:46,902
The llama hair.

428
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,902
Llamas are nature's
greatest warriors.

429
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:53,864
Thanks, Dipper!
