1
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,334
Oh, no Mabel. I...
I don't feel so good!

2
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:17,722
I...

3
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,658
Bleechhh!

4
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:22,727
Ohh! Grunkle Stan,
what did you feed us?

5
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,430
Bwahhhh!

6
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:30,769
Barfy!
Guys, stop!

7
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,305
Something terrible
just happened!

8
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:42,647
Comedy gold!
All right, all right!

9
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:44,716
Party supplies
are now off-limits.

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,319
Mr. Pines,
whose birthday is it again?

11
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:49,354
Nobody's. Thought this party
might be a good way

12
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,323
to get kids to spend money
at the shack.

13
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:52,424
Nice!

14
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,359
The young people of this town
want fun,

15
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,561
I'll <i>smother</i> 'em with fun!

16
00:00:56,596 --> 00:01:00,332
Maybe comments like that
are why kids <i>don't</i> come
to the mystery shack.

17
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:03,735
Hey! Hey! How's about
you make yourself useful
and copy these flyers?

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,508
Oh, boy! A trip to
the copier store!

19
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:12,510
Calendars, mugs,
t-shirts and more!

20
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,613
They got it all
at the copier store.

21
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:17,482
That's not their slogan,
I just really feel that way
about the copier store.

22
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,352
Save the trouble.
You know the old copier
in my office?

23
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:23,321
I finally fixed
the old girl up.
Good as new!

24
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,626
Butterflies!

25
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,729
Does it even work?

26
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,633
Uhh!

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,741
Success!

28
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,742
Aah!

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Aaah!
Aaah!

30
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,519
Stay back!

31
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:04,362
Oh, my gosh. Mabel,
I think this copier
can copy human beings!

32
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:09,267
Do you realize what this means?

33
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:51,249

34
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,414
All right, party people,

35
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,316
and Dipper,

36
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,584
let's talk business.

37
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:02,320
Soos, because
you'll work for free...
and you begged...

38
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:03,521
I'm letting you be D.J.

39
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,789
You won't regret it,
Mr. Pines.

40
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:08,393
I got this book that
teached me how to D.J.
R-r-r-right.

41
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:10,362
Not encouraging.

44
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,570
I-I could work
with Wendy.

45
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:23,308
You realize if you do,
you gotta commit to staying
at the ticket stand with Wendy.

46
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:27,579
No getting out of it,
just the two of you,
alone, all night.

47
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,750
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

48
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,288
I promise.

49
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,661
Aah! What?

50
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:46,631
Uh, uh,
I can work the counter
with you, Wendy!

51
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,467
Let's kiss! Mmm... Mmm...

52
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,735
Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want,

53
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,537
but <i>I</i> have devised a plan

54
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,673
to make sure my night with Wendy
goes perfect.

55
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,744
Plan? Oh, you're not
making one of those
overcomplicated listy things,

56
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,547
are you?
Overcomplicated?

57
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:06,684
Let me just... all right,
hold that there... okay...

58
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,522
"Step one:
Getting to know each other
with playful banter."

59
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,490
Banter is like talking,
but smarter.

60
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,726
That sounds like
a dumb idea for poop-heads.

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,628
Yeah, see, this <i>isn't</i> banter.

62
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,396
This is what I want
to avoid with Wendy.

63
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,632
The final step
is to ask her to dance.

64
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,601
Oh, Dipper!

65
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:26,671
I'm so happy you decided to work
the ticket stand with me!

66
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:30,742
You're so organized.
Show me that checklist again?

67
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:32,410
Oh!

68
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,679
If I follow
steps one through eleven,

69
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:36,581
nothing can get in my way.

70
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:39,484
Dippe<i>you're</i> the one
getting in your way.

71
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:43,321
Why can't you just walk up
and talk to her
like a normal person?

72
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:44,389
Step nine, sister...

73
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,537
Can your uncle
throw a party or what?

74
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,473
<i>The energy...</i>
<i>it's electric!</i>

75
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:04,776
<i>Uh, lightning. Lightning...</i>

76
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,544
And if anyone wants to leave,

77
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm charging an exit fee
of 15 bucks!

78
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,349
I've only got 13!
We're trapped!

79
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,658
"Step one: Casual banter."

80
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,361
So, here's a casual question.

81
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,597
What's your favorite
type of snack food?

82
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,433
Oh, man. I can't
just pick <i>one.</i>

83
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,335
No way! Mine too!

84
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,337
Wait. What?
Uh, I mean...

85
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:33,338
I mean...

86
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,543
New topic! New topic!

87
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:42,580
Go! Go!
Work it! Work it!

88
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:51,689
Wow! You've got an animal
on your body! I'm Mabel.

89
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:55,627
Hi. I'm grenda.
This is candy.

90
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,329
Why do you have forks
taped to your fingers?

91
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,766
Improvement of human being.

92
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,505
I've found my people.

93
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,241
<i>Remember, dudes,</i> <i>whoever, um,</i>

94
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:11,709
<i>party hearties... what?...</i>

95
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:13,711
<i>gets the party crown!</i>

96
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,447
<i>Most applause at the end</i>
<i>of the night wins!</i>

97
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:18,616
Whoa!
Wow!

98
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,554
Party crown?
I'll take that.

99
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:24,289
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:25,490
Who's that?

101
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,293
The most popular girl in town:
Pacifica northwest.

102
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,595
I always feel bad about myself
around her.

103
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,297
<i>I can't just</i>
<i>give you the crown.</i>

104
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:33,498
<i>It's sort of</i>
<i>a competition thing.</i>

105
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:38,269
Honestly,
who's gonna compete
again<i>me?</i>

106
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:40,572
Fork girl? Lizard lady?

107
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,642
Hold me, candy!

108
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:47,345
Our kind isn't welcome here!

109
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:50,748
Hey! I'll compete!

110
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,351
I'm Mabel.

111
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:56,387
That sounds like
a fat old lady's name.

112
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:58,389
I'll take that as a compliment.

113
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:01,392
May the better partier win.

114
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,496
Nice meeting you!

115
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:07,265
She's going down.

116
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,235
Whoa! Sounds like the party's
gettin' nuts!

117
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,705
<i>Let the battle for</i>
<i>the party crown begin!</i>

118
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,673
<i>Mabel comes out strong.</i>

119
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,509
<i>Watch out, pacifica!</i>

120
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,279
I've gotta get in there!
Cover for me?

121
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,680
Heh heh. Um, well, I...

122
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:25,283
thanks, man.

123
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,356
I'll be back shortly!

124
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,258
I'm sure Stan won't mind
if I'm gone for a few minutes.

125
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:35,727
Hey! What are you
doin', kid?!

126
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,329
These suckers aren't
going to rip <i>themselv</i>off.

127
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:39,597
Yeah!

128
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,733
You promised. Remember?

129
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,401
I did?

130
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,570
Dippe <i>I promise.</i>

131
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,383
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

132
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,619
Argh. If only I could be
two places at once.

133
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,531
I wonder if this
is a good idea.

134
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,376
Whoa!

135
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,245
I have a really big head.

136
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,050
Ha! Sorry.
Ha! Sorry.

137
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,151
You first.
You first.

138
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,186
Stop copying me!
Stop copying me!

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,954
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

140
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:39,190
Aah! Ow! Ow!
Funny bone.

141
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:43,194
I will call you
"number two."

142
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,328
Definitely not.

143
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,130
You know a name
I've always wanted...

144
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,232
Tyrone.
Tyrone.

145
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,334
Okay, Tyrone,
let's get down to business.

146
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,970
I'm thinkin' you cover me
at the ticket stand

147
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,338
while I ask Wendy to dance.

148
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:56,374
I know the plan, buddy.

149
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,447
Hey, we're not gonna get jealous
and turn on each other

150
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,315
like the clones
in the movies, are we?

151
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:06,951
Dipper, please. This is you
you're talking about.

152
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,021
Plus, hey, you can always
just disintegrate me with water.

153
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:12,090
Yeah...
Yeah...

154
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,958
<i>Yeah...</i>
<i>Yeah...</i>

155
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,032
Whew.

156
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,335
Great news, Wendy.

157
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,071
I got somebody to cover
the concessions for me.

158
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:29,974
That's awesome! You can
hang out with me and Robbie.

159
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,176
Robbie, you remember Dipper
from the convenience store.

160
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:33,411
Uh, no.

161
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:36,147
Yo, Wendy, check out
my new guitar.

162
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:39,283
Whoa, cool.

163
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:44,388
Robbie, you're a stupid,
arrogant fraud,

164
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:47,358
but kiss me anyway
because you can play guitar.

165
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:49,961
Oh, wait. I forgot
something.

166
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,330
Ohh...

167
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,099
Let's get married <i>tonight!</i>

168
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,270
<i>Hey, buddy,</i>
<i>it's me. You.</i>

169
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:01,072
I just had the same
jealousy fantasy.

170
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:03,407
We gotta get rid of Robbie
if I ever want to
dance with Wendy!

171
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:07,078
Hey, Dipper!
We're gonna go sit on the couch.
Meet us when you're done.

172
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,046
Oh, no! They're
sitting on the couch!

173
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,381
We gotta think of
something quick!

174
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,185
I got an idea.
I got the same one.

175
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,087
But we're gonna need some help.

176
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,423
And that's where
you come in,
number three.

177
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,260
But what if Robbie catches me?
I'll be all alone.

178
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:23,461
Okay, one more clone.
Makes a good point.

179
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:26,230
Four dippers. This is
a four-Dipper plan.

180
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,433
Uh-oh, paper jam.

181
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:37,408
Aah!
Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi!

182
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,047
Come on, you're not gonna
make me partner up wi<i>him,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

183
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,415
Shh! Don't be rude.

184
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,284
Hey, buddy, hey.
It's okay.

185
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:50,388
Okay, just one more clone.

186
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:54,025

I used to sing like that...

190
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,069
Before my voice changed.

191
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,270
<i>Pacifica pulls ahead!</i>

192
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,972
Try and top <i>that.</i>

193
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,207
Oh, grenda? By the way,

194
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,076
you sound like
a professional wrestler.
Ha ha ha ha!

195
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,378
I wanna put her in a headlock
and make her feel pain!

196
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:17,181
It's not over
till it's over,
sisters!

197
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:18,249
Watch this!

198
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,184
Soos! Give me

199
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:24,188
the eighties's

00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,993

203
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,439
Now I'm gonna do a flip!

204
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,243
That was for <i>you</i> guys!!!

205
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,049
<i>Dudes, would the owner</i>
<i>of a silver and red dirt bike</i>

206
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,352
<i>please report outside?</i>
<i>It is being stolen right now.</i>

207
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,386
Wait... what?!

208
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,457
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

209
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:02,026
Hey! Come back here!

210
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,362
Oh, tough break.
I wonder who those guys are

211
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,430
that aren't me
because I'm right here?

212
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:09,033
<i>Now we're gonna</i>
<i>bring it down for a minute.</i>

213
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,269
<i>Ladies, dudes,</i> <i>now's the time.</i>

214
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,042
Ah, snap!
Love this song!

215
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:24,448
Hey, goofus!
Now's your chance
to ask Wendy...

216
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:27,418
now's your chance
to ask Wendy to dance!

217
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:30,154
Come on! Go!
I... ahh...

218
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,358
Uhh-uhh-uhh...

219
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:38,229
Aah! I'll be right back.

220
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,167
Oh, I agree. You can't
just go and <i>dan</i>with her.

221
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,170
The dance floor
is a mine field!
A mine field, Tyrone!

222
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:47,438
What if there's a glitch
in the sound system!

223
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:50,207
Stan might get in the way!
Robbie might come back!

224
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:53,244
There's too many variables!
We need help.

225
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,429
All right, dippers,
gather round.

226
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,067
Now's the time.
You all clear on
what to do?

227
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:21,172
Hey, Soos, look!
A glowing dot!

228
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,142
Oh, man, I am so glad
I turned my head.

229
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,178
That dot does not disappoint.

230
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,462
Right. Like I'm gonna
fall for <i>that.</i>

231
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:48,332
Aaah! Gimme that money, Sonny!

232
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,103
There's your cue.

233
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:54,438
It's the perfect moment
to ask Wendy to dance.

234
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,040
Good luck, me.

235
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,476
I don't need luck.
I have a plan.

236
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,479
Aaah!

237
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:04,081
Oh, hey, man,
what's up?
W-what are you doing here?

238
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:06,150
I mean, wouldn't you rather
be out on the dance floor,

239
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,052
uh, in, like,
exactly 42 seconds?

240
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:09,987
I'm just waiting
for the bathroom.

241
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,255
Um, um, okay.

242
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,190
Uh, small talk,
small talk, small talk...

243
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:16,127
So, hey, let's say
everyone at this party
gets stuck on a desert island.

244
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,029
Who do you think
the leader would be?

245
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:19,263
I...Uh...

246
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:21,966
I think I'd go with
this lunatic.

247
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,072
I'd probably go for
stretch over there.

248
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:31,075
Uh, because tall people
can reach coconuts?

249
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,414
Speaking of tall,
want to see something?

250
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:39,150
Those are my three brothers,
and I'm...

251
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,384
Boop!

252
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:43,220
Ha! You were a freak!

253
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,455
Yep.

254
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,390
You know, kids used to
make fun of my birthmark

255
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,225
before I started
hiding it all the time.

256
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,294
Birthmark?
Uh, no, it's nothing!

257
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:52,296
I-I...
why did I say that?!

258
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,099
No way, dude.
Now you have to show me.

259
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,168
Show me, show me!

260
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,074
The big Dipper!

261
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:05,142
That's how you
got your nickname!

262
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:07,344
I thought your parents
just hated you or something.

263
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,114
Hey, I guess we're both freaks.

264
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,021
Wait here?
Of course!

265
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,389
Hey!

266
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:20,124
What are you doing up here?!

267
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:22,393
Number ten had been
distracting Soos for 15 minutes!

268
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:26,097
He's gonna get tired
of that dot eventually.
Never!

269
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,332
You won't believe it, guys.
I bumped into Wendy accidentally

270
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,167
and things are actually
going great!

271
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:33,204
That's nice, but not the plan.
Do we have to remind you?

272
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,342
Oh, man, you guys sound crazy.

273
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:41,045
Look, maybe we don't
need the plan anymore,
ya know?

274
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,280
Maybe I could just go talk
to her like a normal person.

275
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,316
You bite your tongue!

276
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,118
If you're not gonna
stick to the plan,

277
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:50,054
maybe <i>you</i> shouldn't be
the Dipper to dance with Wendy.

278
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,323
If you think about it...

279
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:56,127
Guys, come on.
We said we weren't
gonna turn on each other.

280
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:58,095
I think we all knew
we were lying.

281
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,097
No! No! Hey!

282
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:07,972
Uhh!

283
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,039
No, wait!

284
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:14,178
Aaah! I can't breathe
in here!
Yeah, you can!

285
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:17,982
Plus there's snacks
and a coloring book
in there for you!

286
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,016
Ohh!

287
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:27,892
Okay, so now that
original Dipper...
or "Dipper Classic"...

288
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:31,195
is no longer fit for it,
I nominate myself
to dance with Wendy instead.

289
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,831
I've been around the longest,
so it should be me.

290
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,833
Right? I mean, logically.
Logically, guys.

291
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,134
Fair point, fair point.

292
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,937
Maybeshould get
to dance with Wendy

293
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,006
because I've been around
for the <i>least.</i>

294
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,941
That makes, like, zero sense.

295
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,242
<i>You</i> make zero sense!

296
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,178
Watch it!
Don't shove people!

297
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:49,079
Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi!

298
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,781
Aaaah!

299
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:53,150
Hey, you want some
cheese and crackers, buddy?

300
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,921
Huh? Huh?

301
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,155
Yikes.

302
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,890
Hey, guys?

303
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,258
What would you do if you
were trapped in a closet?

304
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:02,793
Break out.

305
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:09,934
Wend...

306
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:13,771
Come on, man, give it up.
You're overpowered.

307
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,005
Hold on, guys, think about it.

308
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,741
We're exact equals
mentally and physically.

309
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:20,010
If we start fighting,
it'll just go on for infinity!

310
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:22,980
That's true.
Maybe we should
just give up...

311
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:25,115
Aaah!

312
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,084
Clone fight!!!

313
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,156
Quit hitting myself!
Quit hitting myself!

314
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,757
Aaah!

315
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,161
Guys, come on, it's me!

316
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,930
Hey, you!
Get <i>off!</i>

317
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,099
Hey! Classic Dipper's
getting away!

318
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,834
No, friends.

319
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,769
It's me. Number seven.

320
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:48,939
That's not me, guys,
that's not me!

321
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:52,142
Get him!

322
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:55,112
Stay back, stay back...

323
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,254
Boo!
Lame. Lame.

324
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,094
Huh. How 'bout that?

325
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,864
You!
Uh-oh.

326
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,005
<i>One more song, dudes,</i>
<i>and then it's time</i>

327
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,007
<i>for the bestowing</i>
<i>of the party crown!</i>

328
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,876
<i>It's gonna be the...</i>

329
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,211
<i>Nailed it.</i>

330
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:30,014
Pacifica, I just want to say
that whoever wins,

331
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,149
it's been a super-fun party.

332
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:34,918
Aww. It thinks
it's gonna win.

333
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,220
Hey, did you hear that?

334
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,889
People clapping
for the weird girls?

335
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,758
Yeah. Me neither.

336
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:45,095
Say it! Say I can
dance with Wendy!

337
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,930
Never!

338
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:50,034
Wendy?
Wendy?

339
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:55,239
Robbie!

340
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,007
Shut <i>up.</i>

341
00:18:57,042 --> 00:19:00,811
Ohh. We blew it, man.
Ohh. We blew it, man.

342
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:06,183
I don't know.
You wanna go grab
a couple sodas or something?

343
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,986
<i>Let the party crown</i>
<i>voting commence!</i>

344
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:11,822
Good luck, Mabel.

345
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:15,059
<i>Applaud to vote for Mabel!</i>

346
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:18,028
Yeah! Go, Mabel!

347
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,832
<i>Let's check</i>
<i>the applause-o-meter.</i>

348
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:25,002
<i>Oh... Oh... Pretty good...</i>

349
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:27,838
<i>And your next contestant,</i>
<i>pacifica!</i>

350
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:37,047
<i>Uh-oh! A tie!</i>

351
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,216
<i>This has, like,</i>
<i>never happened before.</i>

352
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:53,130
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we...</i>
<i>we have a winner.</i>

353
00:19:56,034 --> 00:20:00,003
<i>The winner of the contest</i>
<i>is pacifica northwest.</i>

354
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:01,905
Thank you, Jorge.

355
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,774
Thank you, everyone!

356
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,143
Everyone come to the after-party
at my parents' boat!

357
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:07,211
Whoo-hoo!

358
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,215
Pacifica! Pacifica! Pacifica...

359
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:16,153
Ohh. Sorry I let you guys down.

360
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,789
I understand
if you want to leave.

361
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,125
But then we would
Miss the sleep-over.

362
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,026
The what?
We want to call our moms

363
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,795
and sleep over here with you!

364
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,797
You're like a total rock star!

365
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:28,098
I have magazine boys.

366
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,968
Really? You guys!

367
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:34,004
Maybe we don't have
as many friends as pacifica,

368
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,875
but we have each other,
and that is pretty good,
I think.

369
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,177
Soos! Play another song!

370
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:42,146
This thing's going all night!

371
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>Way head of you, hambone.</i>

372
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,823
Some night, huh?

373
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,862
Ahh. You think we really
even have a chance with Wendy?

374
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:01,064
I mean, she's 15, we're 12.

375
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,866
I don't know, man.
I hope so.

376
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,135
But we're making zero progress
the way we're doing it.

377
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,904
The only good conversation
you had with her

378
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:08,939
was when you didn't do
any of that list stuff.

379
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:12,142
I know. Mabel was right,
I <i>do</i> get in my own way.

380
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:14,011
Literally!
Literally!

381
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,914
Whoa...

382
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:24,054
Oh, boy, don't look now.

383
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:27,825
Tyrone!
It's okay, dude,
I had a good run.

384
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,992
Remember what we talked about.

385
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,227
Uh, of course!

386
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:33,096
Hey, and quit being
such a wimp around Wendy, okay?

387
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,199
For my sake!!!!

388
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,101
Tyrone!

389
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,971
You were the only one
who understood.

390
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,110
Ha ha ha!

391
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:03,827
Dipper! Where have you been?

392
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:05,796
Meet my girlfriends!

393
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:13,937
Yeah-uh!

394
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:35,926
Found it.

395
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,859
