1
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,626
( wind meter squeaking )

2
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:09,995
( rumbling )

3
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,401
( snoring )

4
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,505
( snoring )

5
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:30,983
Thirty long years
and it's all led up to this.

6
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,584
My greatest achievement!

7
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:35,687
Probably
should have worn pants.

8
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:38,991
Agh!

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,426
( chuckles )

10
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:42,995
Feisty, I like it.

11
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:54,006
If I finally
pull this off,

12
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,741
it will all have been
worth it.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,148
I just need to keep
playing it cool.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,551
If anyone ever finds out
about this...

15
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:11,590
( scoffs ) Yeah, right.
I've come this far.

16
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:13,859
Who could possibly
catch me now?

17
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:25,070
( beeping )

18
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:29,708
<i>AGENT 1: See there,</i>
<i>there it is again.</i>

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,076
<i>AGENT 2: We haven't</i>
<i>seen readings like this</i>

20
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:32,778
for 30 years.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,580
<i>Is it coming</i>
<i>from deep space?</i>

22
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,681
<i>An enemy</i>
<i>weapons site?</i>

23
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,918
<i>Just as I suspected.</i>

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,855
Gentlemen, we're going
<i>to Gravity Falls.</i>

25
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,132
( alarm buzzing )

26
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,168
Oh, right.

27
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,970
Show time.

28
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,939
<i>STAN: Welcome</i>
<i>to the grand re-opening</i>

29
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,107
<i>of the Mystery Shack!</i>

30
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:36,108
( cheers and applause )

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,709
Mystery Shack!

32
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,011
We're here
to celebrate the defeat

33
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,145
of that skunk little Gideon.

34
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,747
CROWD: Boo!

35
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:44,116
Please, please,
boo harder.

36
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,884
CROWD: Boo!

37
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,686
But I didn't catch
that pork chop all alone.

38
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:50,122
These two scams deserve
some of the glory.

39
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,123
Oh!

40
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,190
Okay, okay.

41
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:53,525
Most of the glory.

42
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,761
Smile for the camera.

43
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,596
Your camera's
a cinder block, Toby.

44
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,499
I just want to be
a part of things.

45
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,200
Smile for a real camera.

46
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,202
Everyone say
"something stupid."

47
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,605
TOGETHER: Something stupid!

48
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,140
And don't forget to come
to the after party

49
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:09,875
tonight at 8:00.

50
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:12,010
We're doing
a karaoke bonanza, people.

51
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:13,211
Lights! Music!

52
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,147
Enchantment!
Phoo!

53
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:16,915
And an amazing

54
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,150
karaoke performance
by our family band,

55
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,818
Love Patrol Alpha.

56
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,219
Oh, I don't know
about that.

57
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,854
I would never
agree to that ever.

58
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,189
Too late, I wrote your names
on the list.

59
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,190
It's happening.

60
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,525
( blows horn )

61
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,060
Buy your ticket, people.

62
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,227
You know you don't have
anything else

63
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,696
going on in your lives.

64
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,230
I'm talking to you,
pizza guy.

65
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,166
Don't lame out on me.

66
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,034
Ha!
The town loves us.

67
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,236
We finally got that Gideon
smell out of the carpet.

68
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:40,672
Everything
is finally going my way.

69
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,874
Hey, Grunkle Stan,
now that we have a moment,

70
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,177
I've been meaning to ask you
for my journal back.

71
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,512
What? Journal?

72
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,815
Oh, you mean
this old thing?

73
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,184
It was so boring
I couldn't even finish it.

74
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,588
( squeals )

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,123
You didn't see nothing.

76
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,891
Wait, you're just gonna
give it to me?

77
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,727
Just like that?

78
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,261
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?

79
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:04,896
I-- I got to go.

80
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:06,531
Whoa!

81
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,599
I wouldn't mind
a kiss on the cheek.

82
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,734
Not gonna happen.

83
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:16,208
Mabel,
we've got to talk.

84
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,876
Almost losing my journal
made me realize

85
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,578
that I'm halfway
through the summer

86
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,213
and still no closer
to figuring out

87
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:22,948
the big mysteries
of Gravity Falls.

88
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,516
Gideon almost
destroyed the town

89
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:25,717
to get his hands
on this journal.

90
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,552
But why?
Who wrote it?

91
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,121
Where are
all the other journals?

92
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,655
What was Bill talking about
when he said

93
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,624
everything was
going to change?

94
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,227
There's something huge
going on right under our noses.

95
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,762
And it's time
we stop goofing around

96
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:38,830
and get to the bottom of it.

97
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,899
Bro, you've looked at that
thing, like, a bazillion times.

98
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,768
There's nothing
left to discover.

99
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,636
Half the pages are blank,
remember?

100
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,873
I just feel like
I'm one puzzle piece away

101
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,307
from figuring out everything.

102
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:50,876
Don't worry, Dipper.

103
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:53,245
Lord Mystery Ham
is on the case.

104
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,580
"I play by me own rules!
What? What?"

105
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,783
I don't know
why I tell you things.

106
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:58,850
Do you hear that?

107
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,857
Hey, Mr. Pines,
what's that code word

108
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,692
I'm supposed to yell
when I see a government vehicle?

109
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,694
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?

110
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,602
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!

111
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,137
I will not hesitate
to use the hose

112
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,739
on the elderly.

113
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,240
Uncle Stan,
what's happening?

114
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,176
Yeah, you never
shut down the gift shop.

115
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,310
( doorbell ringing )

116
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,079
( knocking on door )

117
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,980
Welcome to the Mystery Shack,
gentlemen.

118
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:30,182
What can I get you?
Key chains?

119
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,950
Snow globes?

120
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,786
These rare
photos of American Presidents?

121
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:36,288
My name is Agent Powers.

122
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,622
This is Agent Trigger.

123
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,191
We're here to investigate

124
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,193
reports of mysterious activity
in this town.

125
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,928
Activity.

126
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,297
Mysterious activity
in the Mystery Shack?

127
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,364
You got to be joking.

128
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,200
I assure you I am not.

129
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:50,168
I was born with a rare disorder
that makes me

130
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,604
physically incapable
of experiencing humor.

131
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:54,306
( nervous laughter )

132
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,841
I don't understand
that sound

133
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,109
you're making
with your mouth.

134
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,643
Now if you'll excuse us,

135
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:00,178
we're conducting
an investigation.

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,780
Investigation.

137
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,215
Wait, wait.

138
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,683
Did you guys say
you're investigating

139
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,017
the mysteries of this town?

140
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,253
That information
is classified.

141
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:09,387
But, yes.

142
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,289
Look, between you and me,

143
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,358
I believe there is a conspiracy
of paranormal origin

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,193
all connected
to this town.

145
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,395
We're just one small lead away
from blowing

146
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:19,731
the lid off this
entire mystery.

147
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,299
Are you kidding me?

148
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:23,001
I'm investigating
the exact same thing.

149
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:24,369
I found
this journal in the woods

150
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,338
which has almost
all the answers.

151
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,874
If we work together,
we could crack the case.

152
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,344
If you have
evidence of these claims,

153
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:34,779
we should talk.

154
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:37,349
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.

155
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:39,151
I have so much
to show you.

156
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,986
I'm sorry, agents.

157
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,355
Kid has an overactive
imagination and, like,

158
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,723
a sweating problem.

159
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,158
MABEL: ( laughs ) Zing!

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,759
Paranormal town stuff,

161
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,027
it's just
part of gift shop lore.

162
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,062
Sells more tickets, you know.

163
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,197
Pop-poro-po-po.

164
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,366
Swag.

165
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,234
We have other spots
to investigate.

166
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:57,836
We'll be on our way.

167
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,070
I'm confiscating
this for evidence.

168
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,172
POWERS:
Smart move.

169
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,840
Wait!
No, wait!

170
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:02,874
We have so much
to talk about.

171
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,743
Hold it, kiddo.

172
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,378
Trust me, the last thing
you want around here

173
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,946
in a party is cops.

174
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,948
I'm confiscating
that card.

175
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,816
And how's about
you go be a normal kid?

176
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,752
Flirt with a girl,
or steal a pie off a windowsill.

177
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:15,387
But, Grunkle Stan,
you don't understand.

178
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,722
And don't go talking
to those agents.

179
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,393
( groans ) That could have
been my big break.

180
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,428
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan
is right.

181
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,263
We're throwing
a party tonight.

182
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,165
Can't you go one night
without searching

183
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,401
for aliens or raising
the dead or whatever?

184
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,336
I'm not gonna
raise the dead.

185
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:33,171
I just need a chance to show
those agents my book.

186
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:35,006
Trust me, Dipper.

187
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,008
The only book you'll need
tonight is right here.

188
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,210
Boo!

189
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,314
I say "kara," you say "oke."
Kara...

190
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,017
Kara...
Kara...

191
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,320
I could do this all day.

192
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,058
Agh!

193
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,059
Well, the confetti
cannon works.

194
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,961
( gasps )

195
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,296
And the karaoke machine
has all the best songs.

196
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:00,432
"We built this township
on rock and roll."

197
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,567
"Danger lane
to highway town."

198
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,470
"Taking over midnight"
by AmperSandra.

199
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:07,973
Listen, kid, you do not want
to hear this voice singing.

200
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,874
Trust me.

201
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,811
Grunkle Stan, karaoke
isn't about sounding good.

202
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:15,513
It's about
sounding terrible, together.

203
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:17,449
( laughing )

204
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,884
Check it out! These black lights
make my teeth look scary.

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,122
It's like a crime scene
in my mouth.

206
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,423
Come on, you'll love it.

207
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:27,158
( sighs )
It's not fair.

208
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,194
Finally I meet someone
who can help me

209
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,963
solve the mysteries of this town
and Stan confiscates their card.

210
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,798
Dude, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this,

211
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,467
but I'm pretty sure
Stan hides like

212
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,469
everything in his room.

213
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,472
If I go into Stan's room,
I could get in so much trouble.

214
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:42,040
Yeah, you're probably right.

215
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,975
That's what
makes it fun, dummy.

216
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:48,113
Man, I can't wait to smash
these Stanatas.

217
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,914
Smash!

218
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,816
Grenda
has entered the party!

219
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,518
Stan's brains
look delicious.

220
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,986
Girls!

221
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:57,789
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!

222
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,457
Is that a boom box sweater?

223
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,892
See for yourself.

224
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:02,193
Poke!
( music playing )

225
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:05,797
Yeah, yeah!
Work it! Ah!

226
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,334
Aw!

227
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:11,202
I thought this was
gonna be a rave.

228
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:13,505
Thompson, take off your shirt
and make it a rave.

229
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:16,841
I'll do anything
for your approval.

230
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,276
Oh, come on.

231
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,911
I promise I won't
send it to anyone.

232
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:24,849
Who's got one good eye
and one good pie?

233
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,351
These kegs
are full of meat.

234
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:27,952
( giggles )

235
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:30,422
Tambry sends me
the craziest text.

236
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,090
The whole town is showing up

237
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,192
and no sign
of those pesky agents.

238
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,561
Wendy, Dipper, how are those
posters coming along?

239
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,265
Hmm.

240
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,003
I'll keep
an eye out for Stan.

241
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,571
You go rustle through
his weird old man biz.

242
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,473
( creaking )

243
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:54,479
All right, Grunkle Stan,
where did you hide that card?

244
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,547
Nothing.

245
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,015
Nothing.

246
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,083
Nothing.

247
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:01,119
Ew!

248
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,554
Pretending
I never saw that.

249
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:04,989
Wait a minute.

250
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,059
( laughs )
Yes!

251
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,495
I got it!

252
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,430
( dialing )

253
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,631
( line ringing )

254
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,933
<i>POWERS: Agent Powers.</i>

255
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,601
Hi, this is Dipper.

256
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,069
The kid from the Mystery Shack,
the one with the,

257
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:20,038
um, sweating problem.

258
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,073
I have that journal
I wanted to show you.

259
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:24,275
And you're certain this journal
<i>will help our case?</i>

260
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:25,977
I'm 100% positive.

261
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,346
<i>Very well.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

262
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:29,547
( gasps )

263
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:30,548
Sorry, Dipper.

264
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,117
I got distracted.

265
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,052
Kid, why did you call
those agents?

266
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,587
I've told you once,
I've told you 100 times,

267
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,323
there's nothing
supernatural going on

268
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,324
in Gravity Falls.

269
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:40,959
Yes, there is.

270
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,260
After everything
that's happened,

271
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,062
you have to know
that by now.

272
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,197
All I know
is that your dumb obsession

273
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,600
is gonna get us all in trouble
one of these days.

274
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,668
Now go enjoy
the rest of the party,

275
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,204
'cause when it's over,
you're grounded.

276
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,444
Hmm.

277
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:08,620
( party music playing )
Hey, boys, looking good!

278
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,355
Gorney,
you clean up nice.

279
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,924
Mr. Poolcheck,
move those crazy legs.

280
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:15,560
You-- You weird pool man.

281
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,395
What's the problem,
officers?

282
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:21,065
Did you catch my face
going 90 smiles per hour?

283
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,635
We've got complaints about
the loudest party in town.

284
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,503
Three words.

285
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:26,571
We want in.

286
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,975
Welcome to your dreams.

287
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:32,444
( whistles blowing )

288
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,516
Guys,
I'm so glad to see you.

289
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:40,251
Working together,
we can crack

290
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:42,454
all the big questions
of Gravity Falls.

291
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:44,989
Trust me, this book is the lead
you've been looking for.

292
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,724
I'm thinking
full-scale investigation.

293
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,359
Forensics, researchers.

294
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,661
Do you guys have
a helicopter?

295
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,995
( chuckles )

296
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:53,031
I'm sorry, "helicopters."

297
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,667
Kid, I'd love to believe you,
but this just looks like

298
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,569
more junk
from your uncle's gift shop.

299
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,537
I mean, "leprecorn"?

300
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,140
I can't be the only one
that thinks that it's not funny.

301
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:04,242
I can confirm.
Not funny.

302
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,077
No, it's real, I swear.

303
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,645
You should
"send it to the lab."

304
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,647
Am I saying that right?

305
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,683
Your uncle was right about
that overactive imagination.

306
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,718
We've got paperwork
to do, kid.

307
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,453
Boring paperwork.
Wait!

308
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:17,088
This book is real.

309
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,690
Gnomes, cursed objects,
spells!

310
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,158
Listen!
Uh...

311
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,693
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!

312
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:25,196
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!

313
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,433
( howling )

314
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:29,501
Huh?

315
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:30,602
Huh?

316
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,277
( growling )

317
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,714
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.

318
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,616
Spooky journal,
100% real.

319
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:46,150
Now can we work together?

320
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,585
Mother of all that is holy.

321
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:48,720
What do we do?

322
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:50,588
It's just one zombie.

323
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,457
Trust me, I see stuff like this
all the time.

324
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,458
( roars )

325
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,559
( screams )

326
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:57,228
( sighs in relief )

327
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,429
Good thing
it was just that one.

328
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,404
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?

329
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:08,540
Kid, we've been chasing
the paranormal for years,

330
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,775
but we've never seen
anything like this before.

331
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,076
Get down!

332
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:13,278
( screaming )

333
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,148
( screaming )

334
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,350
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?

335
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:24,155
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪

336
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:27,292
♪ Making all that money
and getting them girls ♪

337
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,093
Oh!

338
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,196
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?

339
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:34,499
When I say Mabel,
you say Pines.

340
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:35,533
( rumbling )

341
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:36,668
Mabel!

342
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,169
( screams )
Mabel!

343
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:39,771
We're all gonna die!

344
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:40,772
Why does that never work?

345
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:42,574
Whoa, whoa.

346
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,375
I think it's an earthquake.
( blows horn )

347
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,511
Hey, everybody, we got
to get out of here!

348
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:48,079
We're all doomed.

349
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,280
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!

350
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:52,784
Mabel,
escape while you still can!

351
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,786
Wait! No!
Don't leave!

352
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:57,522
You haven't even done
our family karaoke song yet.

353
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:58,623
( all screaming )

354
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,860
( panting )

355
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,462
Dipper,
what's the one thing

356
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,164
I asked you
not to do tonight?

357
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,632
Raise the dead.

358
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:08,800
And what did you do?

359
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:10,134
Raise the dead.

360
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,370
( growling )

361
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,706
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.

362
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,644
( screaming )

363
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:20,712
Sorry, one second.

364
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:23,481
You've got to admit
this is pretty cool.

365
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,852
( growling )

366
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:29,821
Zombies!

367
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:32,323
Don't panic. Maybe they're just
a really ugly flash mob.

368
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,461
Dudes, stay calm.

369
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,462
I've been
training for this moment

370
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:39,163
my whole life.

371
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:40,898
With all the horror movies
I've seen,

372
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,233
I know literally everything
there is to know about

373
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:43,134
how to avoid zombies.

374
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,906
Second thought,
gonna flip the script.

375
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,608
Can I eat your brains?

376
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,243
Yay or nay?

377
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,845
Seeing some yay faces
over here.

378
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,146
( shrieking )

379
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:01,953
Quick, the golf cart.

380
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:06,290
Oh, come on.

381
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,392
( chuckles )
That's a bummer.

382
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,660
Good news for me though.

383
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:10,361
Soos!

384
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,797
Sorry, dude, I just really
want those brains.

385
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,865
Stay back!

386
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:22,507
Give it up, dudes.

387
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,375
Your fighting only makes us
look more rad.

388
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:26,511
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?

389
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,279
How's he supposed to help?

390
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,714
He doesn't even believe
in the supernatural.

391
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:34,452
Those agents
could ruin everything.

392
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:35,853
Darn kid!

393
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:37,588
He has no idea
what he's messing with.

394
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,525
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.

395
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,327
Sort of like me, I suppose.

396
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,298
I got too much
on my mind to worry about

397
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
those kids right now.

398
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,934
All right, let's see.

399
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,804
( panting )

400
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:55,940
( growling )

401
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,442
Take that, sucker!

402
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,981
This thing's a surprisingly
good weapon.

403
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,452
We need to board up
all the windows.

404
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:15,727
Okay,
maybe that will hold them.

405
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,762
Oh!
Hi, dudes.

406
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:19,931
By the way, I taught the zombies
how to get to the fuse box.

407
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,566
Among these dudes
I'm like a genius.

408
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,268
Get those brains, dog.

409
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,970
( growling )

410
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,574
Dipper, isn't there something
in the journal

411
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:31,375
about defeating zombies?

412
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:33,678
No! There's nothing in here
about weaknesses.

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,546
( sighs )
This can't be happening.

414
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,949
I wanted answers so bad
I put everyone in danger.

415
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:39,684
Now we're toast.

416
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,719
It's all my fault
and no one can save us.

417
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,987
( growling )

418
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:44,589
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!

419
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:46,724
Dipper!

420
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:47,825
( screaming )

421
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,398
( panting )

422
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,969
You two, attic, now!

423
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:59,570
Grunkle-- Grunkle Stan?

424
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:00,972
I said now!

425
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,040
All right,
you undead jerks,

426
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,809
you ready to die twice?

427
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,677
( panting )

428
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,014
The only wrinkly monster
who harasses my family is me.

429
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,015
Take that!

430
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:12,717
And that!

431
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:16,821
Beat it, no-eyes.

432
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:18,322
( growls )

433
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:21,993
Anyone else want a piece?

434
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:22,994
( grunts )

435
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,395
( creaks )

436
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,405
( panting )

437
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:37,008
( banging on door )

438
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,309
( whimpering )

439
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,012
( coughing )

440
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,580
Oh! Ow!

441
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:43,948
Everything hurts.

442
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,750
Grunkle Stan,
that was amazing!

443
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:46,851
Are you all right?

444
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:48,853
( nervous chuckle )

445
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,889
Well, at least, you can't deny
magic exists anymore, right?

446
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,558
Kid, I've always known.

447
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,459
Wait.
What are you talking about?

448
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,361
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.

449
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:59,664
Of course, this town is weird
and the one thing

450
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,099
I know about that weirdness
is that it's dangerous.

451
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,371
I've been lying about it to try
to keep you away from it,

452
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,073
to try to protect you from it.

453
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,413
It looks like I didn't lie
well enough.

454
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:16,647
( growling )

455
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,584
What do we do?
What do we do?

456
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,052
Normally,
the journal would help us,

457
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:22,119
but there's nothing
in there about

458
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,120
defeating zombies.

459
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,488
It's hopeless.

460
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,057
Wait, wait, wait, the text!

461
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,892
It's glowing
in the black light.

462
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:28,993
What?

463
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,464
All this time I thought
I knew all the journal secrets.

464
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,733
But they're written
in some kind of invisible ink.

465
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,901
Invisible ink?

466
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,102
This is it.

467
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,804
"Zombies have a weakness!

468
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,873
Previously thought
to be invincible,

469
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,408
their skulls can be shattered by
a perfect three part harmony."

470
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,611
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?

471
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:48,679
I have a naturally
high pitched scream.

472
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:51,415
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.

473
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,084
Boys, boys.

474
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:56,020
I think you're both missing
the obvious solution.

475
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:00,992
MABEL: ( on mic )
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

476
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,593
<i>Does this seem loud?</i>

477
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,831
Oh,  <i>Gossiping Housewives</i>
<i>is on.</i>

478
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,099
( growling )

479
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,734
Eh, I already sat down.

480

we are Love Patrol Alpha!

483
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,115
I never agreed
to that name.

484
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:25,483
Hit it!

485
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:30,421
( music playing )

486
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:33,124
Uh, Mabel, our lives
may not be worth this.

487

Duck!

00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,266
Thank you!

518
00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:51,235
We'll be here all night!

00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:52,970

zombie idiots!

Pines! Pines!

523
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:01,245
I'm sorry about this, guys.

524
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,280
I totally ruined
everything.

525
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:04,982
Dipper, are you kidding me?

526
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,218
I got to sing karaoke
with my two favorite

527
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,686
people in the world.

528
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:10,955
No party could ever top that.

529
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:13,657
Kids, listen,
this town is crazy.

530
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,226
So you need
to be careful.

531
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:16,794
I don't know
what I'd do with myself

532
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:18,262
if you got hurt
on my watch.

533
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:20,698
I'll let you hold
onto that spooky journal

534
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,633
as long as you promise me
you'll only use it

535
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:25,669
for self-defense
and not go looking for trouble.

536
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:27,705
Okay,
as long as you promise me

537
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:29,874
that you don't have
any other bombshell secrets

538
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:31,709
about this town.

539
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:32,743
Promise.

540
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:33,978
Promise.

541
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,014
Man, we have got
a lot of zombie damage

542
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:38,249
to clean up.

543
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:39,583
Where's my handyman anyway?

544
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:42,253
SOOS: Brains! Brains!

545
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:43,320
Holy Moses!

546
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:45,256
Wait!

547
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:47,258
There's a page in here about
curing zombification.

548
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
It's gonna
take a lot of formaldehyde.

549
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,895
Ooh, and cinnamon.

550
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,296
Come on, Soos,
let's fix you up.

551
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:54,732
Brains! Brains!

552
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:55,933
Soos, cut it out!

553
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,134
( chuckles ) Sorry, dude.

554
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:58,869
I can't believe it.

555
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,104
All this time
the author's secrets

556
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,872
were hiding in plain sight.

557
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:04,175
A whole new chapter
of mysteries to explore.

558
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
That was insane.

559
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,582
I've never seen
anything like it.

560
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:12,817
Who do we report to?

561
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:17,621
This is bigger than
we imagined.

562
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:19,323
We need to bring in
the big guns.

563
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,891
But they'll never
believe us.

564
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,626
Then we'll make them
believe us.

565
00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:25,296
This is the town
we've been searching for.

566
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:27,131
Ba-- Ba-- Bam.

567
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,833
Another zombie!

568
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:30,134
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

569
00:22:31,736 --> 00:22:33,037
TOGETHER: Oh, okay,
it's just--

570
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,839
Who is that guy?
A very ugly man.
