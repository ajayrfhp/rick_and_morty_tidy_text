1
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:10,733
Are you ready for
the ultimate challenge?

2
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,813
I'm always ready!

3
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,812
Then you know what this means!

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,741
Syrup race! Ahh...

5
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,725
- Go, sir syrup!
- Go, mountie man!

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,796
- Go go! Go go!
- Almost... Almost...

7
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,812
Yes!

8
00:00:23,813 --> 00:00:25,733
I won!

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,724
Bleah.

10
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,799
Ho ho, no way!

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,728
Hey, Mabel, check this out.

12
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:32,703
Human-sized hamster balls?

13
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:34,762
<i>I'm </i>human-sized!

14
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:35,817
No, no, Mabel. This.

15
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,749
We see weirder stuff
than that every day.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,742
We didn't get any photos
of those gnomes, did we?

17
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:43,770
Nope, just memories.
And this beard hair.

18
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,788
- Why did you save that?
- Mm-mm-mm.

19
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,783
Uhh! Good morning,
knuckleheads.

20
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,741
You two know what day it is?

21
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:50,750
Um... Happy anniversary?

22
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,717
- Mazel tov!
- Baah!

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,724
It's family fun day, genius!

24
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,784
We're cuttin' off work
and havin' one of those,
ya know,

25
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,778
Bonding-type deals.

26
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:03,737
Grunkle Stan, is this
gonna be anything like
our last family bonding day?

27
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,799
You call that Ben Franklin?
He looks like a woman!

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,816
Uh-oh!

29
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,812
Ohh! The county jail
was <i>so </i>cold.

30
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:14,787
All right, maybe I haven't been
the best summer caretaker.

31
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:17,799
But I swear, today we're gonna
have some <i>real </i>family fun.

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,728
Now, who wants to
put on some blindfolds
and get into my car?

33
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:22,738
- Yay!
- Yay!

34
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,757
Wait. What?

35
00:01:23,758 --> 00:02:02,696

36
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,638
Whoa! Whoa!

37
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,766
Blindfolds never lead
to anything good.

38
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:14,712
Wow. I feel like
all my other senses
are heightened.

39
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,775
I can see with my fingers.

40
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:18,713
- Oh!
- Oh!

41
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,738
Grunkle Stan, are <i>you
</i>wearing a blindfold?

42
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,737
Ha ha! Nah,
but with these cataracts,
I might as well be.

43
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:25,722
What is that, a woodpecker?

44
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,755
Okay, okay, open 'em up.

45
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,737
Ta-da! It's fishin' season!

46
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,738
- Fishing?
- What are you playing at, old man?

47
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,741
You're gonna love it!
The whole town's out here!

48
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,745
Here, fishy-fishies!
Get into the pan.

49
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,687
Say "cheese."

50
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,775
Aaaah!

51
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,750
Uh, is this good?

52
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:47,779
No!!!

53
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,738
I'll show you how
a <i>real </i>man fishes!

54
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,691
Grr! Aaah!

55
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:54,738
Ha ha ha ha ha!

56
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,704
Hyeah! Uhh!

57
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:58,754
- Dead! Dead!
- Dead! Dead!

58
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,741
Get him!
Get him!

59
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,738
That's some quality
family bonding!

60
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,733
Uncle Stan, why do you
want to bond with us
all of a sudden?

61
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,725
Come on,
this is gonna be great!

62
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,694
I've never had
fishin' buddies before.

63
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,692
The guys from the lodge
won't go with me.

64
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,721
They don't <i>like </i>or <i>trust </i>me.

65
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:16,683
I think he actually wants
to fish with us.

66
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:18,733
Hey, I know what'll cheer
you sad sacks up.

67
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:21,704
Pow! Pines family
fishin' hats.

68
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:23,745
That's hand-stitching,
ya know.

69
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:27,766
It's just gonna be you, me,
and those goofy hats
on a boat for ten hours!

70
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:28,771
Ten hours?!

71
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,745
I brought the joke book.

72
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,687
No. No!

73
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:34,742
There has to be
a way out of this.

74
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:36,712
I seen it!

75
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,684
I seen it again!

76
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,750
Hoo hoo hoo!

77
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,762
The Gravity Falls gobblewonker!

78
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,750
Come quick before he
scramdoodles away!

79
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:50,758
Ha ha hoo-ah!

80
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,758
Aw. He's doing
a happy jig.

81
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,766
No!!! It's a jig
of grave danger!

82
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,746
- Hey! Hey!
- Aaah!

83
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:00,780
Now, what did I tell you
about scaring my customers?

84
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:02,779
This is your last warning, dad.

85
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,721
But I got proof this time,
by gummity!

86
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:08,729
Behold!

87
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,691
It's gobbledywonker
what done did it!

88
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,684
It had a long neck
like a gee-raffe,

89
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,730
and wrinkly skin like... like
this gentleman right here. - Huh?

90
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,712
It chopped my boat up
to smitheroons!

91
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:22,737
It shim-shammed over
to scuttlebutt island!

92
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,733
Ya gotta believe me!!!

93
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,729
Attention, all units.

94
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,692
We got ourselves
a crazy old man.

95
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:36,713
Aw, donkey spittle!
Banjo Polish...

96
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,745
Well, that happened.

97
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,691
Now, let's untie this boat
and get out on that lake!

98
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,741
Mabel, did you hear
what that old dude said?

99
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,741
"Aw, donkey spittle!"

100
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,734
The other thing...
about the monster.

101
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:52,683
If we can snag a photo of it,
we could split the prize
fifty-fifty.

102
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,708
That's two fifties!

103
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,772
Imagine what you could do
with five hundred dollars!

104
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,754
Not so high and mighty anymore.

105
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,734
- Ohh.
- Aha-ha ha ha ha!

106
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,741
Hey, boys.

107
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:18,775
You can look...
But you can't touch.

108
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,712
Squeak! Squeak!
Squeak! Squeak!

109
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:21,722
Squeak squeak...

110
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,716
Awesome!

111
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,733
Mabel. Mabel?

112
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:29,741
Dipper, I am one <i>million </i>percent
onboard with this!

113
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,775
Grunkle Stan!
Change of plans!

114
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:34,754
We're taking that boat
to scuttlebutt island,

115
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,712
and we are gonna find
that gobblewonker.

116
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,721
- Monster Hunt!
- Monster Hunt!

117
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:40,763
- Monster...
- Monster Hunt!

118
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,758
Monster... eh...

119
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,776
I'll go.

120
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,766
You dudes say something
about a monster Hunt?

121
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,734
- Zeus!
- What's up, hambone?

122
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:53,696
- Kapoosh!
- Pow! Explode!

123
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,755
Dude, you could totally
use my boat for your Hunt.

124
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,750
It's got a steering wheel,
chairs... normal boat stuff.

125
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:00,744
All right,
let's think this through.

126
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,738
You kids <i>could </i>go
waste your time

127
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,733
on some epic
monster-finding
adventure,

128
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:09,716
<i>or </i>you could spend the day
learning how to tie knots
and skewer worms

129
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:10,746
with your great uncle Stan!

130
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:24,772
So, whaddya say?

131
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,772
We made the right choice!

132
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:32,771
Ingrates!
Ah, who needs 'em?

133
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:36,734
I got a whole box
of creepy fishin' lures
to keep <i>me </i>company.

134
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,696
Uhh!

135
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:41,763
Hoist the anchor!

136
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,691
Raise the flag!

137
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,766
We're gonna find
that gobblewonker!

138
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,721
We're gonna win
that photo contest!

139
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:52,754
Do any of you dudes
have sunscreen?

140
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,741
We're gonna...
Go get sunscreen!

141
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,772
Yay!

142
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,711
All right, if we want to
win this contest,

143
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,668
we've gotta do it right.

144
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,732
Think. What the #1 problem
with most monster hunts?

145
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,672
You're a side character
and you die in the first
five minutes of the movie.

146
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:20,643
Dude, am I a side character?
Do you ever think about
stuff like that?

147
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:21,732
No, no, no...
camera trouble.

148
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,711
Say bigfoot shows up.
Zeus, be bigfoot.

149
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,647
There he is! Bigfoot!

150
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,672
Uh-oh! No camera!

151
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,660
Oh, wait! Here's one!

152
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,701
Aw, no film!

153
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,656
You see what I'm doing here?

154
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:36,736
- Uh-huh.
- Dude's got a point.

155
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:41,643
That's why I bought
seventeen disposable cameras.

156
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,719
Two on my ankle,
three in my jacket,

157
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,722
four for each of you,
three extras in this bag,

158
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,689
and one under my hat.

159
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,689
There's no way
we're gonna Miss this.

160
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,656
Okay, everybody,
let's test our cameras out.

161
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:52,722
Ahh! Dude!

162
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,697
You see? This is exactly
why you need backup cameras.

163
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:56,702
We still have sixteen.

164
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,727
Ahh! Bird!

165
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,689
Fifteen. Okay, guys,
I repeat, don't lose
your cameras.

166
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,644
- Wait. Lose the cameras?
- Don't!

167
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,694
Dude, I just threw two away.

168
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,706
Thirteen!

169
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:09,665
All right, we still
have thirteen camera...

170
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:12,718
Twelve. We have
twelve cameras.

171
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,718
So what's the plan?
Throw more cameras overboard
or what?

172
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,727
No! No. Okay.

173
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,732
You'll be lookout,
Zeus can work
the steering wheel,

174
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,702
- and I'll be captain.
- What?!

175
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,714
Why do <i>you </i>get to be captain?

176
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:25,727
What about Mabel, huh?

177
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,710
Ma-bel! Ma-bel!

178
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,660
Ma-bel! Ma-bel!

179
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,711
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

180
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,656
What about co-captain?

181
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:33,715
There's no such thing
as co-captain.

182
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,651
Ohh. Whoops!

183
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:37,672
Okay, fine!
You can be co-captain!

184
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:38,723
Can I be associate
co-captain?

185
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,672
As co-captain,
I authorize that request.

186
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,718
Well, as <i>first </i>co-captain,
our #1 order of business

187
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,722
is to lure the monster out
with this.

189

- Granted.
- Permission co-granted.

190
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:53,661
Permission
associate go-granted.

191
00:08:56,678 --> 00:09:00,710
Dude, I don't know what
I expected that to taste like.

00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:49,348
nahh!

318
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,274
Ahhh.

319
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:54,345
Zeus! Beavers!

320
00:15:57,286 --> 00:15:59,285
Aaaaah!!!

321
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,320
Ohh! Beavers...

322
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,352
Aaah! Oooooh...

323
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:07,370
Aaaah!

324
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,349
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

325
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,366
- Headlock!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!

326
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,356
The fishes?!
They seek revenge!

327
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,349
Swim, boys, <i>swim!!!</i>

328
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,344
Aaah! Look out!

329
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,370
Easy, <i>easy...</i>

330
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,290
My glass!

331
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,353
Where do I go?!

332
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,273
Um... uh...
go to the falls!

333
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:58,349
- I think there might be a cave behind there!
- "Might" be?!

334
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,370
- Brr. Ahh. - Ooh.
- Ahhh.

335
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,340
It's stuck!

336
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:16,298
Ha ha! Yeah!

337
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,345
Wait. It's stuck?

338
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,316
- Boop.
- Ha ha ha!

339
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,298
Did you get a good one?

340
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,357
They're all good ones!

341
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:32,320
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hamster ball!

342
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,341
What the...?

343
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,319
Huh?

344
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,295
- Uh!
- What's wrong?

345
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,352
Hmm.

346
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,273
Careful, dude!

347
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,291
I've got this! Hold on!

348
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,299
Hey, guys!
Come check this out!

349
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,335
Work them bellows
in the... huh?!

350
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,348
Aw, banjo Polish!

351
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,327
Wha... <i>you?</i>

352
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:12,311
<i>You made </i>this?

353
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,319
Wha... why?

354
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,369
Well, I...

355
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,294
I, uh...

356
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,365
I just wanted attention!

357
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,344
I still don't understand.

358
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,305
Well, first I just
hootenannied up

359
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:25,297
a bio-mechanical
brain wave generator,

360
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:27,320
and then I learned to operate
a stick shift with my beard.

361
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:30,340
Okay, yeah,
but <i>why </i>did you do it?

362
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:33,302
Well, when you get to be
an old fella like me,

363
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,315
nobody pays any attention
to you anymore.

364
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:38,306
<i>My own son hasn't
visited me in months!</i>

365
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,303
<i>So I figured maybe
I'd catch his fancy</i>

366
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,319
<i>with a 15-ton
aquatic robot.</i>

367
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,344
<i>Wha-ha-ha-ha!
Aha-ha-ha!</i>

368
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:47,285
Aha-ha! Aha-ha...
ahh...

369
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:50,273
In retrospect,
it seems a bit contrived.

370
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,366
You just don't know the lengths
us old-timers go through

371
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:56,278
for a little quality time
with our family.

372
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:00,277
Dude.

373
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:03,273
I guess
the real lake monster
is you two. Heh heh.

374
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,277
Sorry, it just, like, boom,
just popped into my head here.

375
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,335
So... Did you ever
talk to your son about
how you felt?

376
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:12,277
No, sir, I got to work
straight on the robot.

377
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,273
I made lots of robots
in my day.

378
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:17,294
Like when my wife left me
and I created a homicidal
pterodactyl-tron,

379
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,353
or when my pal Ernie didn't come
to my retirement party

380
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:21,369
and I constructed
an 80-ton shame-bot

381
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,306
that exploded
the entire downtown area!

382
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,348
Aha-ha-ha-ha!

383
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:30,357
Aha... well, time to get back
to work on my death ray!

384
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,362
Any you kids got a screwdriver?

385
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:38,277
Well, so much for
the photo contest.

386
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,370
We still have
one roll of film left.

387
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:41,307
What do you want to do with it?

388
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,273
Ahh.

389
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:47,362
Hey! Over here!

390
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,290
What the... kids?

391
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,319
I thought you two were off
playin' spin the bottle
with Zeus.

392
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,369
Well, we spent all day trying
to find a legendary dinosaur.

393
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,298
But we realized
the only dinosaur
we want to hang out with

394
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,361
is right here.

395
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,356
Save your sympathy!

396
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,336
I been having a great time
without ya...

397
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,281
makin' friends,
talkin' to my reflection...

398
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,349
I had a run-in with
the lake police!

399
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,290
Guess I gotta wear
this ankle bracelet now,
so that'll be fun.

400
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,366
So I guess there
isn't room in that boat
for three more?

401
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,273
You knuckleheads
ever seen me thread a hook
with my eyes closed?

402
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,295
- Five bucks says you can't do it.
- You're on!

403
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:30,273
Five more bucks
says you can't do it
with your eyes closed

404
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:33,294
<i>plus </i>me singing at
the top of my lungs!

405
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,319
I like those odds!

406
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,274
- Whoa! What happened to your shirt?
- Long story, dude.

407
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,328
All right.
Everybody get together,
say "fishing."

408
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:41,349
- Fishing!
- Fishing!

409
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:43,353
Dude, am I in the frame?

410
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,273
Whaa!

411
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:01,370
- What was that?
- Mm-mm.

412
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,320
- Who wants to hear a joke?
- Not me.

413
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:21,315
Huh huh! Yeah, you do!
Here it goes.

414
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,327
Why did the pelican

415
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,302
get kicked out the restaurant?

416
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,320
I don't <i>care.</i>

417
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,290
Because he had a very big bill!

418
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,274
- ♪ LA LA LA LA ♪ yuk yuk yuk!
- Ooh. Boo.

419
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,274
- Blah blah bluh.
- Bad joke. Bad pelican joke.

420
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:39,341
