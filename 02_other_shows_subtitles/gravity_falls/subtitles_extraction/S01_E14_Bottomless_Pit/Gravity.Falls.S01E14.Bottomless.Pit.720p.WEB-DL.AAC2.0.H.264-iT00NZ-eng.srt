1
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,890
Gravity Falls  S01E14  Bottomless Pit

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,720
In this land of ours, there are many great pits,

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,130
but none more bottomless than the bottomless pit,

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,190
Which as you can see here, is bottomless.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,380
Question. Is it bottomless?

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,620
Kids, could one of you try explaining this to Soos?

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,500
Grunkle Stan, why are we here again?

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,450
To dispose of things that we don't want.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,910
So long, mystery shack suggestion cards.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,780
Goodbye, creepy love letters from Lil' Gideon.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,780
Die! Die!

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,750
What are you doing?

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,810
Throwing stuff, dude. Everyone's doing it!

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,430
What you got there, Mabel?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,230
It's just my personal box of mysterious secrets.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,540
Nothing worth wondering about!

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,680
Goodbye forever!

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,070
Grunkle Stan, do I really have to be the one to point out

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,060
that a bottomless pit is, by definition, impossible?

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,250
Says you!

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,960
Well, I guess we'll never know.

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,750
Aah! It's some sort of invisible pushing force!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Quick! Everyone back to the shack!

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,920
I'm not done getting rid of these yet!

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,930
Grunkle Stan! No!

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,710
Almost... almost... almost...

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,750
So, anyone wanna scream some more?

28
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,890
Where are we?

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,180
We're somewhere where it looks like we're nowhere.

30
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,320
We're gonna land on something eventually.

31
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,710
Could be any second now!

32
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,370
Well, it looks like we're down here for the long haul.

33
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,880
Who wants to see some card tricks?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,790
Ta-da!

35
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,260
Hey! Maybe we should pass the time by tellin' stories.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,780
I've got a story! It's called: "The time Grunkle Stan

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,790
got us all thrown into a bottomless pit.

38
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,300
Where we spent the rest of our natural lives!"

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,650
Go on.

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,170
Come on, Dipper, you can do better than that.

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,470
Fine. I'll tell you a story,

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
A story I'd like to call:

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,570
Voice over.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,340
Ready?

45
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,350
Spin the pig! Whoo!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,040
Hey, Grunkle Stan, ever kissed a pig before?

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,670
I'm not gonna answer that question.

48
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,820
Guys! Guys! I think I just got bit by a snake!

49
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,060
I need you to get me to a hospital quick!

50
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,520
What? What's so funny?

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,060
Uh, sorry, it's just hard to focus on what you're saying

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,340
with that squeaky puberty voice you got there.

53
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,160
My what?

54
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,280
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dipper.

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,050
Your voice is hilarious.

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,370
Are you saying my voice cracks?

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,540
My voice doesn't crack.

58
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,290
Dude, no offense, but it cracks so much

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,950
we've already made a techno remix out of it.

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,070
Nice to meet you.

61
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,600
My name's Dipper Pines.

62
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,950
P-p-pines, Pines, Pines.

63
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,670
Nice to meet you.

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,410
P-p-pines, Pines, Pines.

65
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,210
Do I really sound like that?

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh! Here comes my favorite part!

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,110
Stop it, guys!

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,610
Gimme that!

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,880
Spin the pig!

70
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,470
Ugh! Even my sighs sound weird.

71
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,720
- Hello there!
- Aah!

72
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,350
I couldn't help but overhear yer sitchy-ation!

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,410
Old man McGucket!

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,500
Part-time inventor!

75
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,080
Why did you spit on your hand?

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,230
I don't rightly know!

77
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,980
Hey, I remember you!

78
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,640
Your robot almost killed me!

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,670
Come here! Follow me into this dark, dangerous alley!

80
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,060
Lately I been a-tinkerizin' with a voice altering tonic,

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,550
on account of my horrifyin' voice!

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,290
You can run, but I'll still be in yer nightmares!

83
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,400
This will really fix my voice?

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,110
Thanks! Ah!

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,820
Come mornin', you'll sound like a new man!

86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,550
If you survive.

87
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,750
Good morning, Dipper.

88
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,070
I did it! I did it!

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,820
Now I have a new voice!

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,960
'morning, Mabel. Who's my favorite Mabel?

91
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,980
Who are you?

92
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,520
What have you done with my brother?

93
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,130
Dipper!

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,680
I'll save you from this body-switching warlock!

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,650
Mabel, it's me!

96
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,530
This is my voice now.

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,060
I sound awesome.

98
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,130
Sound awesome.

99
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,700
I knew boys' voices changed, but this is weird.

100
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,130
Weird and bad.

101
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,480
Mabel, this is the best thing that ever happened to me.

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,960
And just think of the prank calls.

103
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,640
Hello?

104
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,800
Hello. This is the president of the United States of America.

105
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,290
I'm calling to tell you...

106
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,100
What? Who is this?

107
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,140
Ho-ho-ho! Magnificent!

108
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,870
Mabel no like.

109
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,610
How you diddly doing, Soos?

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,480
- Kill it!
- Oh!

111
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,260
Kill it with fire! Everyone flee!

112
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,090
What gives, man?

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,760
You guys all made fun of my old voice.

114
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,780
I thought you'd like the new one.

115
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,850
Dude, at least before you sounded like a real person.

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,310
Now you sound like some kind of weird commercial dude.

117
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,610
I'll find Stan.

118
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,080
He'll like my new voice. You'll see!

119
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,650
I'll be right back after these messages.

120
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,650
I, uh, I mean, goodbye.

121
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,900
Grunkle Stan. Grunkle Stan! Where are you, Grunkle Stan?

122
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,170
Huh? I'd know that voice anywhere!

123
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,830
You're the guy who prank called me earlier!

124
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,500
No. No, I'm not.

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,260
I'm just a 12-year-old boy!

126
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,510
You expect me to believe that, you crazy-voiced punk?

127
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,970
W-wait! No! Aiyee!

128
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,530
There's a prank caller on the loose! Let's get him!

129
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,150
Yeah! Come on! Come on, let's get him!

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
Escape!

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,680
McGucket! Your invention was a catastrophe!

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,740
That's probably why I live in the dump!

133
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,760
My own sister didn't recognize me.

134
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,600
I scared away crowds!

135
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,740
I even sound ridiculous when I cry.

136
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,360
Well, now, here's yer problem!

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,120
I gave you the wrong drinky-majig!

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
This one's for voiceover professional.

139
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,950
Ah! I'm sure I've got a better voice in here somewhere.

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,640
Good! Hurry up.

141
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,990
You got here just in time.

142
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,510
Come sundown, you'd have

143
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,730
reverted back to your ridiculous old voice.

144
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,380
It was ridiculous, wasn't it?

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,350
D-d-d-d-dipper Pines,

146
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,150
That's me!

147
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,480
This remix is dedicated to my brother.

148
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,900
Dipper, your voice is one of a kind.

149
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,570
Dude, I never heard anything like it.

150
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,940
R-r-remix over!

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,790
You ready for yer new voice?

152
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,880
This one should be permanent!

153
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,250
Hey, guys.

154
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,940
- Dipper!
- Oh, dude, you're back!

155
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,910
Yeah. I guess I realized

156
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,010
that even though my voice might not be perfect,

157
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,530
It's still mine, and I wouldn't change it for anything,

158
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,520
Not even for whatever was in this new vial.

159
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,870
So what did you do with the rest of that potion?

160
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,320
I dumped it in Stan's coffee.

161
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,560
Any of you kids seen my girdle?

162
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,620
Where my girdle at?

163
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,320
What? What's so funny? I'm Grunkle Stan!

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,310
Kids laughin'. Laughin' at their grunkle.

165
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,390
I spy, with my little eye, something that is Black!

166
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,100
Ooh! Ooh! Everything.

167
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,640
Yay for Soos!

168
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,990
Yay for Soos!

169
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,720
Hey, guys, who wants to pass the time by spinning?

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,150
Everyone spin!

171
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,750
No.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,390
Dipper's pain is funny, but I'm starting to get bored.

173
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,170
Soos, tell a story.

174
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,440
Really? Okay.

175
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,960
This story is called "Soos's really great pinball story."

176
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,860
Is that a good title? Do they have to be, 
like, puns or whatever?

177
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,380
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

178
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,920
This is it, dudes. After four long years of trying,

179
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,530
I might finally get the high score

180
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,440
on Stan's creepy old pinball machine.

181
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,060
If I do this, I'll go down

182
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,770
in pinball history with the likes of Sal, Gaff,

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
and of course Poo.

184
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,060
Have you ever tried maybe just tilting the machine?

185
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,070
I don't know, dudes.

186
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,540
Isn't breaking the rules, like, against the rules?

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,800
Nuts to the rules! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!

188
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,730
Failure. You stink!

189
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,900
All right, that's it. Ready, kids?

190
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,080
Tilt! Tilt! Tilt! Tilt!

191
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,220
Quit tiltin', pardner. Quit tiltin', pardner.

192
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,880
Tilt!

193
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,410
Bull's eye!

194
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,290
New high score!

195
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,900
- Oh, yes! 
- All right!

196
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,820
This is the best moment of my life.

197
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,910
This totally beats my old best moment.

198
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,620
That ain't right. You cheated.

199
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,550
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

200
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,000
You're just a pinball game, pinball game.

201
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
Taunt, taunt.

202
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,670
Uh, guys? There's an awful

203
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,710
lot of green lightning coming out of that game.

204
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,570
No, that's the normal amount of green lightning.

205
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,070
Ugh. Five more minutes.

206
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,660
Aah! That's not a normal alarm clock.

207
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,810
Soos! We're inside the game!

208
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,530
- Crazy. 
- Sweet moses!

209
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,260
Hushed exclamation of wonder.

210
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,170
Awesome!

211
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,760
Boing! Boing! Boing!

212
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,400
Dude, if this is a dream, I never wanna wake up!

213
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,090
That can be arranged.

214
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,740
Welcome to tumbleweed terror, pardners!

215
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,660
Hey, it's the skeleton cowboy guy.

216
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,810
Did you zap me into your game to congratulate me

217
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,960
On getting the high score? I beat poo, dude.

218
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,340
Hardly. If'n I do recall, I warned y'all not to cheat.

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,060
I tried to be gentleman-like,

220
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,790
but I'm plum sick of being tilted.

221
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,670
So now I reckon. I'm gonna tilt you.

222
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,230
Oh, yeah? Well-- well, take this!

223
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,300
Ow! And this! Ow! It hurts!

224
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
I wish this was working better! Oh, dude!

225
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,650
Soos!

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,210
Get yourselves ready for the...

227
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,090
Multi-ball!

228
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,670
Over there!

229
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,330
Where are you?

230
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,410
I'm not done teachin' you a lesson about cheating yet!

231
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,730
How are we ever gonna get out of here? Think, guys!

232
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm trying, but it's hard

233
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,410
with that gorgeous pinball wench distracting me.

234
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,470
Okay, don't worry, guys.

235
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,990
I know every inch of this machine.

236
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,090
There's a manual power switch inside.

237
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,920
I can sneak in there and turn off the game,

238
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,700
but we'll have to distract the cowboy guy.

239
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,690
Are either of you good at jumping up and down

240
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,010
and making annoying noises?

241
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,630
My time has come.

242
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,450
All right, let's go, Soos. Soos?

243
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,330
So are you, like, doing anything later or--

244
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,490
Right.

245
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,900
Come on out and show yourselves, varmints!

246
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,120
Listen to me and look at what I'm doing!

247
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,080
Somethin' ain't right here.

248
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,200
Distraction! Distraction!

249
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,780
Let me see where this is goin'.

250
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,830
Yippe-ti-yi-- what? Where are ya?

251
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,230
Durn it, I wish I had a neck!

252
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,560
Soos! Psst! What's going on?

253
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,810
Just press the switch already!

254
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,980
Okay, so I was gonna do that, but I've been thinking.

255
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,560
According to this,

256
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,850
turning off the power erases the high score permanently.

257
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,590
That score is, like, my one big life accomplishment.

258
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,230
What? If you don't hurry up we could die in here!

259
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,880
Fair point. But, what is life anyway,

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,340
When compared to the immortality of a high score?

261
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,180
Soos! Are you out of your--

262
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
There y'all are.

263
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,990
Get ready to meet yer maker, kids!

264
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,200
My maker is ballway games in Redmond, Washington.

265
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:34,920
Mabel!

266
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,510
- SOOS!
- SOOS, PLEASE!

267
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,340
Turn it off!

268
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,320
Goodbye, high score!

269
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,410
Oh, you dudes okay?

270
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,960
Yeah, Soos. You did it! You freed us!

271
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,670
Hey, man, I'm sorry you had to lose your high score.

272
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,300
That's okay. I got a new life accomplishment now:

273
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,540
saving you dudes.

274
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,320
You think that pinball wench will call me?

275
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,890
I can't believe this nonsense!

276
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,370
Magic tonics? Soos winning at something?

277
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,980
what do you come up these stuff?

278
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,920
I'll tell you a good story.

279
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,580
It's called "Grunkle Stan wins the football bowl."

280
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,480
Mr. Pines.

281
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,900
I thought old folks were useless,

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,750
But you taught me and my gloating friends a lesson.

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,930
Here's your football winning trophy, Mr. Pines!

284
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,240
Thanks, beautiful woman, but I couldn't have done it

285
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,970
without my sidekick, foot-bot.

286
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,800
Thank you for building me, daddy.

287
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,060
I love you, Stan.

288
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,560
Come on.

289
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,040
What? That story was great.

290
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,220
I even threw in a talking robot for the kids.

291
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,370
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna tell a non-terrible story,

292
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,030
A story called...

293
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,150
Thoothache.

294
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,910
This attraction is gonna make me a fortune!

295
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,610
Easy with that bear, corduroy!

296
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,130
I need him in showroom condition!

297
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,650
No! No!

298
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,030
Aw! They're hugging!

299
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,820
So let me get this straight.

300
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,810
Your plan is to teach this bear to ride a bicycle?

301
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,650
Nah, come on. Everyone's seen a bicycle-riding bear.

302
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,890
No, no. I'm gonna teach this bear...

303
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,570
To drive!

304
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,950
And the yellow light means speed up.

305
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,240
Uh-oh.

306
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,000
What seems to be the problem, officers?

307
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,070
Now there had better be a darn good explanation for this.

308
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,120
Oh, there is.

309
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,850
You see, I'm a very old man, not long for this earth,

310
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,390
and the doctor's assigned me a seeing-eye bear

311
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,530
To drive me to the hospital in case of emergencies.

312
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,920
Is that right? Then where's your doctor's note?

313
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,950
Why, it's right here, inside my jacket!

314
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,700
Ah! There you go!

315
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,690
Well, I can't argue with dr. Medicine.

316
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,500
To the hospital, honeypants!

317
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,040
Grunkle Stan, how could you lie to those policemen?

318
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't you know lying is always wrong?

319
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,200
Mabel, when you get to be my age,

320
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,050
You'll learn that sometimes

321
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,260
You have to bend the truth for the greater good.

322
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,480
Hey, has anyone seen my plate of spaghetti?

323
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,570
No.

324
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,920
But I bet Soos has. You know how he likes to eat.

325
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,030
This is a dark day. Thanks, Grunkle Stan!

326
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,180
See? Greater good.

327
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,100
Waddles, what am I gonna do about Grunkle Stan?

328
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,990
He needs to stop lying.

329
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,370
I know! But how do we stop him?

330
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,700
Maybe you should check Dipper's journal.

331
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,290
Oink, oink!

332
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,140
Say "Oink" One more time.

333
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,310
Oink, oink.

334
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,130
Waddles, you genius!

335
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,920
"Buried 'neath a tree stump in 
the deep forest are truth teeth,

336
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,970
which force upon the wearer an inability to lie." Hmm.

337
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,220
Aah! What's going on? What? Mabel?

338
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,340
Quick question.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,440
What happened to Dipper's spaghetti plate?

340
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,860
I ate it, because I have little to no concern

341
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,090
for other people's possessions or emotions.

342
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,670
Huh. That was strangely candid.

343
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,150
Almost as if I'm unable to lie. Well, goodnight!

344
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,500
You what? That seems like a horrible idea!

345
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,790
It's great!

346
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,520
Now he has to tell the truth.

347
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,650
Scrambled meat, here it is.

348
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,110
Stan, what do you do in secret 
every day during your lunch break?

349
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,460
Usually I spend the hour aggressively scratching myself

350
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,930
in places I shouldn't mention.

351
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,800
Now I'm going to avoid making eye contact

352
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,310
by pretending to read this newspaper,

353
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,950
And go to the bathroom without washing my hands.

354
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Well, that was disturbing.

355
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,010
Don't worry, Dipper.

356
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,070
The truth is always a good thing.

357
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,080
Hey, excuse me.

358
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,970
Do you think this t-shirt is my size?

359
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,490
Never mind the t-shirt! Hey, everybody!

360
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,470
Look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!

361
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

362
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,380
Doing my taxes.

363
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,040
Uh, Grunkle Stan, why did you write this?

364
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,850
Because I regularly commit massive tax fraud.

365
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,880
Might wanna tuck that one away there.

366
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,190
Oh, no!

367
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,460
Sometimes I think, is this all there is?

368
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,710
Is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line?

369
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,550
That we're all just biding our time

370
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,560
until the sweet, sweet release of death?

371
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,210
Kids!

372
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,670
I think I have a growth forming on my back!

373
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,840
Just wanted to be honest with you guys!

374
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,160
I can't take it anymore, Mabel!

375
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,990
You have to take those teeth out of his mouth.

376
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,760
But then he'd be a liar again!

377
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,310
Could is possibly be any worse than this?

378
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,520
So after further investigation,

379
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Turns out there is no Dr. Medicine in Gravity Falls.

380
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,230
You'd better have a durn good explanation for this.

381
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,200
Oh, and I do!

382
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,640
You see, I lied to you.

383
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,320
In addition, I've been parking in handicapped spaces,

384
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,660
shoplifting fireworks,

385
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,590
And smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines.

386
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,060
Also, you're fat.

387
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,530
Is all this true?

388
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,400
No, no, it's not true... right, Mabel?

389
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,070
Uh... sirs,

390
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,020
I have to be completely and totally honest with you.

391
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,720
Our great uncle Stan is...

392
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,750
Is... ugh!

393
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,360
Stan is...

394
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,110
secretly a crime fiction writer!

395
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,090
What?

396
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,420
Yeah! He was just telling you

397
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,930
about a character from his upcoming page-turner

398
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
crime grandpa.

399
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,510
He's never committed a crime in his life!

400
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,480
Also, have you lost weight?

401
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,110
Finally, someone noticed.

402
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,230
Wow, an author!

403
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,810
Can you teach me how to read?

404
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,140
What? Author?

405
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,570
Writer-- masters of fiction!

406
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,870
Good night, officers!

407
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,330
Hey, you all right?

408
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,190
I can't believe I lied!

409
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,490
Mabel, it was for the greater good.

410
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,650
Yeah. The greater good.

411
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,380
Hello, police station?

412
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,870
Yeah, I forgot to tell 'em about my tax fraud.

413
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,390
No, tax fraud.

414
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,010
Get 'em out!

415
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,510
What's gotten into you kids?

416
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,880
We have to find a place to get rid of these!

417
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,420
And I never saw that box full of magical teeth again.

418
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,110
Oh, wait, there it is.

419
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,010
Oh, sweet, my shoes.

420
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,230
I liked the part with the bear.

421
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,970
The rest seemed pretty farfetched.

422
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,250
Mabel, we already know that story.

423
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,330
We just lived through it.

424
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
So, if we're living through that story right now,

425
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,430
How does it end?

426
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,210
Guys, do you see that?

427
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,950
- Oh, what is that?
- Oh, no!

428
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,790
- Where are we going?
- Oh, my god!

429
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,630
Where... where are we?

430
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,980
Look! The shack!

431
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,270
Which means...

432
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,310
We came right back out the top

433
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,940
And I don't think any time has passed.

434
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,040
It must be some kind of wormhole

435
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,470
Yeah, dude, that sounds science enough to be true.

436
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,150
But, but that's impossible.

437
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,700
No one will believe us.

438
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,710
Maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves.

439
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,280
Agree.

440
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,780
He'll be fine.

441
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,580
This is stupid.
