They're like pancakes,

but they probably have
some of my hair in 'em.

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,639
( all screaming )

166
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,781
( panting )

167
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,115
We good?
We good?

168
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:10,322
Hi! Hello! I'm Franz.
And welcome to our home.

169
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,423
What is this?

170
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,024
Yeah.

171
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,428
Are you guys tiny humans?
Or enormous mini-humans?

172
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,763
Neither.
We're lilli-putt-tians!

173
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,365
Lilli-- Lilli-putt...

174
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,267
The name makes more sense
written out than spoken.

175
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,403
And we control the balls!
Behold!

176
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,714
BOTH: Wow!

177
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,523
( yodeling )

178
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,427
That's incredible!

179
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,396
And so needlessly
complicated.

180
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,631
Aw, shucks.

181
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,399
It's only our
life-long passion!

182
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,635
Would you like us
to elaborate through song?

183
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,670
( begins singing )

184
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,671
Nah, we're good.

185
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,474
( sigh )

186
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,043
So what are you hugelings
doing here anyway?

187
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,811
We kind of have to play
this golf tournament

188
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,047
against my rival,
Pacifica.

189
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,582
Oh, rivals.
Rivals, rivals.

190
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,385
Oh, we know
all about rivals.

191
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,620
Put a clog in it,
ya windmill lubbers!

192
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,425
These really bottom
popinjays are terrible

193
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,360
at controlling the balls!

194
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,297
We are the ball masters,
says I!

195
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,265
( pirates laughing
and cheering )

196
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,568
Shut your mouths,
you showboating pirates!

197
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,403
Everyone knows
the Eiffel Tower hole

198
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,537
is the best!

199
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,510
Stay thee your comments,
ye scurrilous Frenchmen!

200
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,813
None controllable
is better

201
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,181
than the knights of...

202
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,083
Wiener castle.

203
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,318
Who wrote this?

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,452
We'll settle
which hole is best!

205
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,453
Attack!

206
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,487
Charge!

207
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,756
Ooh, I'm shiverin'
in me timbers.

208
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,857
Get ready to die!

209
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,628
Long live the mini king!

210
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,531
Die, you evil scum!

211
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,599
Ow!

212
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,633
Yarr!

213
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,202
( yells )

214
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,670
( quacking )

215
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,239
( screaming )

216
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,307
(laughs )

217
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,675
These guys are a riot.

218
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,478
Guys, guys, calm down.

219
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,414
Your fighting is
inadvertently adorable.

220
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,584
Adorable we are, hugeling,
but our tale, less so.

221
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,220
Every hole in the park thinks
that it's superior.

222
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,155
From the cowboys
in the east

223
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,824
to the grimy minors
of the south.

224
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,361
If only there was some way
to decide which side is best

225
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,396
with maybe an award or,
like a trophy.

226
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,397
I don't know.

227
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,466
But, Franz, look!

228
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:40,372
The sticker.
The sticker could decide!

229
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,440
It does say
"the best" on it.

230
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,808
Decide for us, hugeling.

231
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,611
Choose which mini kingdom
to give the sticker to

232
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,346
and end our war!

233
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,414
( mini people cheering )

234
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,415
Uh,

235
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,683
I don't know, guys.

236
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,451
I'm not sure
I want to get involved

237
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,154
in your
weird mini blood feud.

238
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,222
Psst!

239
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,423
Mabel,
this is perfect.

240
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,557
These guys
control the course.

241
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,459
Just tell them
you'll give the sticker

242
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,162
to whichever group does
a better job of helping us win.

243
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,530
I'm not sure, Dipper.

244
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,598
I want to beat Pacifica,

245
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,501
but doesn't this seem like
cheating?

246
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,538
Pacifica's rich, Mabel.
She's cheating at life.

247
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,607
Hmm.

248
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,708
( blows horn )

249
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,809
Thanks, man.

250
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,511
People of the 18 holes!

251
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,713
We're going to have
a game of mini-golf!

252
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,249
And whoever does
the best job helping me win

253
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,817
gets the sticker!

254
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,753
It'll be us, lass,
not these tulip munchers.

255
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,522
I will not be insulted

256
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,458
by a man with no depth
perception wearing earrings.

257
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,492
Just remember,

258
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,894
as long as
you're helping me,

259
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,961
no fighting.

260
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,468
Dude, I'm cutting
"W"s into all my shirts.

261
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,703
Got to give the public
what they want.

262
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,671
Well, the kids
are taking their time.

263
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,473
Looks like
it's gonna be a while.

264
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,545
( romantic ballad
playing on radio )

265
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,385
Sure are a lot of stars
out tonight.

266
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,053
Well,
this is gettin' weird.

267
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,759
Now remember, Pacifica,
winning is everything.

268
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,462
Oh, oh, and also looks.
Winning and looks.

269
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,831
Dad, I've been practicing for,
like, a millions hours, okay?

270
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,299
I've got this.

271
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,702
Pacifica, darling.
We have a party to go to.

272
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,671
We'll just read about
your victory in the paper.

273
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,873
Sergei!
( snaps fingers )

274
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,245
Oh, and whatever happens,
just remember one thing.

275
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,413
You're a Northwest.

276
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,881
Don't lose.

277
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,853
How much do you want to bet
they're no shows?

278
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,523
Looking for someone?

279
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,759
Waiting in the dark
and not creepy at all.

280
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,026
Seriously, though?

281
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,528
I don't know
why you bothered to come.

282
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,433
Oh, I guess you could say
we've got a little something.

283
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,934
Right? Right?

284
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,669
( laughs )

285
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,904
( giggle nervously )

286
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,907
Eighteen holes.
Standard rules.

287
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,310
Winner lives in glory.
Loser wallows in eternal shame.

288
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,345
On your mark,

289
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,047
Get set, Mini golf!

290
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,796
What?

291
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,298
ALL: Yeehaw!

292
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,441
Out of my way!

293
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,609
( grunts )

294
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,314
Are you serious?

295
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,682
( cheering )

296
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,785
Yarr, I say!

297
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,492
( laughs )
Miner hole.

298
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,928
I wonder what cute silly things
are going on down there.

299
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,601
You can't go in there!
There's been a gas leak.

300
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,437
Anyone who goes in there
will die!

301
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,106
( chattering )

302
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,174
I will take it.

303
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,475
No!

304
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,045
Don't go, Big Henry!
We need you!

305
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,813
Go home, Polly.

306
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,522
Ahem.

307
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,794
Come on, Big Henry.
You can do this.

308
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,864
( groaning )

309
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,614
Aah! No!

310
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,483
Sergei! Soda! Now!

311
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,455
Okay, guys,
that was badonkulous!

312
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,623
Hey, hey.
Little high fives, everyone.

313
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,891
Little high fives
all around.

314
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,460
Nice one. You did it.
You're the man!

315
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,661
I don't want to
call it out early,

316
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,529
but I think
the Miners might have

317
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,065
one of these in their future.

318
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,901
( Miners cheering )

319
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,704
Are you kidding me?

320
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,573
After everything
we've worked for?

321
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,074
Calm yourself, Franz.

322
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,744
There may be another way
to win the hugelings' favor.

323
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,811
Knock on wood.

324
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,450
There's something going on,
Sergei.

325
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:23,588
Maybe they has little people
who control where balls go.

326
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,957
We got to get you
English lessons.

327
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,458
I mean, think about it.
I'm globally ranked.

328
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,027
It's ridiculous that
she's beating me.

329
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,432
Ugh, Pitt Cola.
I always forget about the pit.

330
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,135
Get me a different one,
Sergei.

331
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,169
Huh?

332
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,437
( screams )

333
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,443
I can't wait to see
the look on Pacifica's face

334
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,577
when we win.

335
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,712
I'm thinking it will be like...

336
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,481
You know
how she does that?

337
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,649
Dipper, is it bad

338
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,785
that I feel good
about her feeling bad?

339
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,920
Just enjoy your victory,
Mabel.

340
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,189
Trust me,
Pacifica will be fine.

341
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,591
( Pacifica screams )

342
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,227
What's going on here?
Let me go!

343
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:06,097
( screaming )

344
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,198
What did I miss?

345
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,601
Let me go,
you creeps!

346
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,470
Welcome, twins!
Welcome!

347
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,838
I can tell
you're loving this, right?

348
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,540
Right? No?

349
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,774
What are you guys
doing?

350
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,810
This wasn't part of the deal,
tiny Dutchman!

351
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,245
Okay, so we saw
you were favoring

352
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,780
the Miners
and we figured,

353
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,749
what's better than
beating Pacifica?

354
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,050
Pfft!

355
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,518
Killing her, right?

356
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,021
As if.
I'm calling my parents.

357
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,155
Where is my phone?

358
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,590
( giggling )

359
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,224
Send.

360
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,759
Hey, hey!

361
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,261
So how about it, hugeling?
Who's the best now?

362
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,832
PIRATE:
Not so fast, landlubbers!

363
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,267
If you're going to
play dirty, so are we.

364
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,604
Now give us the sticker
or he walks the plank.

365
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,805
No, give us the sticker!

366
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,240
The Miners!
The sticker's for the Miners!

367
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,110
Give it to us!
Give it to us!

368
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,745
Remember Big Henry!

369
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:54,812
Enough!

370
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,915
( gasps )

371
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,984
You know what?
No one gets the sticker!

372
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,320
( booing )

373
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,055
No. No. Nuh-uh.

374
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,157
No booing.
Stop. No.

375
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,127
No one gets the sticker
'cause you're all being jerks.

376
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,229
I mean,
why can't you just get along?

377
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,631
Because
we hate each other.

378
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,267
That's kinda
how rivalries work, lass.

379
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,635
Well then maybe...

380
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,204
Maybe rivalries
are dumb.

381
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,141
Maybe you don't settle them
with petty competitions.

382
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,676
Maybe the only way to be
"the best"

383
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,578
is by ending the fighting

384
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,746
and working together!

385
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,116
( gulps )

386
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,786
( mini people gasp
and murmur )

387
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:35,920
It's all so clear.

388
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,189
If we work together...

389
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,626
Then we can cut open her belly
and get the sticker.

390
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,262
Get the girl!
Slice her open!

391
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,599
You guys aren't appreciating
the lesson here!

392
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,902
ALL: Sticker!
Sticker! Sticker!

393
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,741
( screaming )
Help!

394
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,043
We've got to get out of here!

395
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,379
I have to save Pacifica first!

396
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,692
After her!

397
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,661
Ah, Mr. Dipper!
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

398
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,963
Don't freak out, man!
The water's shallow!

399
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,932
There is literally
no way to drown.

400
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,036
Seriously?

401
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,706
Ugh, took you long enough.
And watch the earrings!

402
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,174
They're worth
more than your house!

403
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,977
You know, on second thought,
maybe I won't untie you.

404
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,612
Untie me!
Untie me!

405
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,047
That's what I thought.

406
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,315
( gasp )

407
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,684
We have you
on miniature pencilpoint.

408
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,285
There's no way around us.

409
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,787
You ready to putt?

410
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,122
Way ahead of you.

411
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,858
ALL: Huh?

412
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,828
Hey, you're actually
not that terrible.

413
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,829
A little rusty, but...

414
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,364
Just shut up and putt!

415
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,136
Get on! Get on!

416
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,237
Gun it!

417
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,840
Don't let them escape!

418
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,211
( screaming )

419
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,679
( tires screeching )

420
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,788
Sergei overboard!

421
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,023
I'll get a new one.

422
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:21,926
They're shutting us in!

423
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,660
( exclaims )

424
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,832
Don't even think about it.

425
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,267
You call yourself a golfer?

426
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,403
Without us, that club
is useless in your hands.

427
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,439
Oh yeah?
What's ten minus six?

428
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,774
Ten-- Hang on.

429
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,009
Fore!

430
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,345
( bell ringing )

431
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,350
( tires squealing )

432
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,126
Stay out,
you dumb hugelings!

433
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,762
( shouting )
We're done with you.

434
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,363
What did you say,
you little trolls?

435
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,731
I will sue you.

436
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,967
I will sue you
and I will own you.

437
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,835
( gasping )

438
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,304
You two.

439
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,206
I don't know what you did
or what's going on,

440
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,708
but if you think just
because you saved my life, I--

441
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,213
I'm sorry, Pacifica.

442
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,350
You totally would've
beat me fair and square.

443
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,087
You're just lucky this sticker
looks fantastic on me.

444
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,222
( car approaching )

445
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,229
Hey!
You're parents aren't here.

446
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,763
You want a ride home?

447
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,199
Puh-leaze,

Hey, I found two tacos!

454
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,781
You're allowed
to eat in the car?

455
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:54,051
Yeah, the car is where
secret surprise snacks happen.

456
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,319
Want one?

457
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,321
Oh, I'm not supposed
to take handouts.

458
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,191
Handouts?
It's called sharing!

459
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,160
You do know
what sharing is, right?

460
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,062
Shar-- Shaar-ing?

461
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,364
Just take it.

Thanks for the ride,

Oh, and Mabel...

00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:16,407
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I had fun.

465
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,442
And tell your servant
I like his W neck!

466
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,245
Yes!

467
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,381
So are you guys, like,
cool now?

The important thing
to remember is that

00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,019
at the end of the day,

471
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,421
she's just an ordinary kid
like us.

472
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,894
Should've charged her
for that taco.

473
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,529
Agreed.

474
