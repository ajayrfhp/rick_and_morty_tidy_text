1
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,295
For tonight's final llusion

2
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:11,650
 we have incredible sack of mystery.

3
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:15,671
When you put your money in
it mysteriously dissapears.

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:19,522
Well, of course! That makes perfect sense!
What a nice man! That was totaly worth a try!

5
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,215
The tiger was badly injured in the explosion

6
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,144
but we repaired him
with a fist.

7
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:29,121
Woo! Yeah! That tiger is our hero!

8
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,182
Tiger fist! will return after these messages.

9
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:36,521
Hey look! It's that commercial
I've been telling you guys about.

10
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:38,655
Are you completely miserable?

11
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:40,559
Yeees!

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,058
Then you need to meet <i>Gideooon</i>..

13
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,103
- Gideon?
- What makes him so special?

14
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,075
He's a psychic!

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,896
So don't waste your time with other
so called man of mystery.

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,524
at Gideon's tent of telepathy!

18
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:05,849
I'm getting all curiosy inside.

19
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,539
Well don't get too curiosy,

20
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:11,825
Ever since that monster Gideon
rolled in town, I've had nothing but trouble.

21
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,558
Gideon!

22
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:22,566
- Well, is he realy psychic?
- I think we should go and find out!

23
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,670
Never! You're forbiden from patronizing the competition!

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,360
Noone that lives under my roof
is allowed under that Gideon's roof.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,633
- Do tents have roofs?
- I think we just found our loophole. Literaly.

26
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:39,016
So come down soon, folks.
Gideon is expecting you.

27
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,057
Gravity Falls
Episode 4 - The hand that rocks Mabel

28
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:27,083
Get right here folks!
Put your money in Gideon's psychick sack!

29
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,074
Oh sure! Wow!
That makes perfect sense!

30
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:35,718
Aww, this is like a bizzaro version of a Mystery shack.

31
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,325
 They even have their own Soos.

32
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:42,548
It's starting, it's starting!

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,289
Let's see what this monster looks like.

34
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,877
Hello America!
My name is lil' Gideon!

35
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,411
That's Stan's mortal enemy?

36
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,472
Like.. he's so.. widdle.

37
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:07,468
Ladies and gentlemen, it is such a gift
to have you here tonight.

- What? I'm not impresed.

- No wonder our uncle is jealous.
- Oh come on, his dance moves were adorable

60
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,115
 And did you see his hair? It was like wooosh.

Yeah, my song is quite catchy.
I know we haven't formaly met.

67
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:25,083
but after yesterday's perfomance,
I just couldn't get your laugh out of my head.

68
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,199
You mean this one?

69
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,460
Aw, what a delight. And when I saw you in the
audience, I said to myself

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,313
now, there is a kindred spirit. Someone
who apreciates sparkly things of laugh.

71
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,374
That's totaly me!

72
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,419
 Enchanting. Utterly enchanting.

73
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,337
- Who's at the door?
- Noone grunkle Stan!

74
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:50,597
I apreciate your discretion,
that Stan is no fan of mine.

75
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:54,427
I don't know how a lemon so sour
could be related to a peach so sweet.

76
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,492
- Gideon!
- What do you say, we step

77
00:05:57,492 --> 00:06:01,423
away from here and chat a bit more.
Perhaps in my dressing room?

78
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,325
Makeovers!

79
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:11,003
Do you see something you like?
Cos I do..

80
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,421
What?

81
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:17,333
Hey Dipper! What's going oon?

82
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,847
Where have you been? And
what's going on with

83
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:22,287
those finger nails, you
look like a wolverine.

84
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,462
I know, right? Waaa!

85
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,565
I'm hanging out with my new pal Gideon.
He's one dapper little man.

86
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:32,106
Mabel, I don't trust anyone
who's hair is bigger than their head.

87
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:35,383
Aw, leave him alone. You never
wanna do girly stuff with me.

88
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:37,870
You and Soos could do
boy stuff all the time.

89
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,205
- What do you mean?
- Hey dude.

90
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,488
- You ready to blow up these hotdogs
in a microwave one by one?
- Am I?

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,505
One at a time! One at a time!

92
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:52,604
Wow! The view from your family
factory is nuts!

93
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,009
Good thing we both brought our
Operate glasses!

94
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,528
Mabel, when I'm up here
looking down on all them lil old people.

95
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:05,477
I feel like I'm king of all I survey.

96
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:08,104
- And guess that makes you my queen!
- What?

97
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,966
You've being so nice to me right now.

98
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,190
Quit it!

99
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:15,453
I can't quit it.
I'm speaking from my heart.

100
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:19,093
- From the where now?
- Mabel, I've never felt this close to anyone.

101
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,149
So..so close.

102
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,359
Look Gideon, I am ..

103
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,701
I like you a lot but let's
just be friends.

104
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,547
At least give me a chance.
Mabel, will you do me the honour

105
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:33,958
- of going on a date with me?
- A play date?

106
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,540
A shopping date?

107
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,745
It will just be one lil old date.

108
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,768
I swear with my lucky bolo tie.

109
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:46,101
Okay, then. I guess.

110
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,335
Mable Pines, you have made me
the happiest boy in the world.

111
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,042
Are you sniffing my hair?

112
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,711
It's not a date, Dip,
it's just, you know

113
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,519
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Until he figured it, I'd throw him a bone.

114
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,825
Mabel, guys don't work that way.
He's gonna fall in love with you.

115
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,444
Pff, yeah, right.

116
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,115
I'm not THAT lovable.

117
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:12,375
- Kaboom! Yes!
- Okay, at least we agree on something here.

118
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:21,722
A night of enchantment awaits, my lady.

119
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:22,904
Oh boy.

120
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,667
I can't believe they'd let us bring
horse in here.

121
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,758
Well, people have hard time saying
'no' to me.

122
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,793
Ah! Monsieur Gideon!
The feet on the table!

123
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,383
An excellent choice!

124
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:42,455
- Jean-Luc, what have we discused about our contac?
- Yes, yes. Very good.

125
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,807
I've never seen so many forks.

126
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:49,187
And water with bubbles in it?
Oh, ulala, weewee.

127
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,132
Oh, parlez-vous français ?

128
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,553
I have no idea what you're saying.

129
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:58,307
Hey, hey! What the jackal is Mabel doing
in the paper next to that crazy pitpocket Gideon?

130
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,169
Oh, yeah. That's like a big deal.

131
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,020
Everybody's talking about Gideon
and Mabel's big date tonight.

132
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,619
What? That little shyster is dating my great niece?

133
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,951
I wonder what the new name will be for the
power couple?

134
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:12,640
Mabidion? Gidiable? Magidbelion!

135
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,855
I didn't know! I didn't hear about it!
And plus, I told her not to!

136
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,837
Yeah, well it ends tonight.
I'm going right down to that little scug's house.

137
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,673
This is gonna stop right now.

138
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,378
Dude, woudn't it be funny if that was a closet?

139
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,997
 And he had to come back again and
walk through the real door?

140
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:33,841
Nope, real door.

141
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,432
Gideon, you little punk!
Open up!

142
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:46,899
I will pardon nothing!

143
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,384
Why! Stan Pines!

144
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:52,973
- What a delight!
- Out of the way, bud.

145
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:56,871
- I'm looking for Gideon.
- Well, I haven't seen the boy around, but since you're here.

146
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:00,262
You simply must come in for coffee.

147
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:04,008
- Bu but I came..
- It's imported. All the way from Columbia.

148
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,615
I went to jail there once.

149
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,276
Some digs you got here.

150
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,889
Oh, this. This is beautiful.

151
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,254
Now, I hear your niece
and my Gideon are well,

152
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:18,526
they are singing in harmony
lately, so to speak.

153
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,299
Yeah, and I'm against it.

154
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,710
No, no, no. I see it as a fantastic
business oportunity.

155
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,048
Yes, the Mystery Shack and
the Tent of Telepathy.

156
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:32,681
We'd been at each other's throats for far..
Let me get that.

157
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:35,862
At each others throats for far too long,
yes we have.

158
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,690
This is our big chance to brush aside
our rivalry

159
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,603
and pull our collective profit, you see.

160
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:47,481
I'm listening.

161
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:51,789
Autograph your own head, shot lady!

162
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,746
Mabel, tonight's date was a complete success.

163
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:02,404
And tomorrow date promisses to top
this one in every way!

164
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:06,459
Woah, woah. You said just one date
and this was it.

165
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,947
What a surprise! A red-crested
south american rainbow maco!

166
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:15,305
Two.. three.. four..

167
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:18,764
Mabel! Will! You!
Accompany! Gideon!

168
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:23,000
To! The ballroom! Dance!
This! Thurpsday!

169
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,262
Thursday!

170
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,972
- Oh so adorable.
- Gideon got a girlfriend.

171
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,586
They're expecting us, please say you'll go.

172
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,701
Gideon, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to say..

173
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,824
- I'm on the edge of my seat
- This is gonna be adorable.

174
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,970
If she says no, I'll die from sadness.

175
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,168
I can verify that will indeed happen.

176
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,131
Hey! How did it go?

177
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,898
I don't know..
I have a lobster now..

178
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:59,839
Well, at least it's over and you will never
have to go out with him again.

179
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,864
Mabel, it's over, right?

180
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,208
Mabel?

181
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,422
He asked me out again and I didn't
know how to say NO!

182
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:10,212
Like this - NO

183
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:12,225
It's not that easy, Dipper.

184
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:15,394
I do like Gideon, as a friend/little sister.

185
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:19,798
So I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
I just need to get things back where they used to be.

186
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,079
You know, friends.

187
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,389
Boat midnight, boat midnight.

188
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:30,563
You know, I thought dancing would be the end
of the evening, right?

189
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,237
Don't you want this evening to last my sweet?

190
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:36,778
NO! I mean, yes.
I mean, I'm always happy hanging with a friend.

191
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,946
Buddy, pal, chump, other word for friend.

192
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,328
- Pal?
- I already said pal. A mate?

193
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,306
How about soulmate?

194
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:49,583
Well, you can't say no to that.

195
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,861
He's so nice, but I
can't keep doing this.

196
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:57,582
But I can't break his heart.
Aaah! I have no way out!

197
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:01,583
- What in the heck happened on that date?
- I don't know. I was in the friend-zone

198
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,986
and then before I knew what was happening,
he pulled me into romance zone!

199
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:07,915
It was like quicksand! Geopardy quicksand!

200
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,309
Mabel, come on. It's not like
you'll have to marry Gideon.

201
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,772
Great news, Mabel.
You have to marry Gideon.

202
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:17,193
- What?
- It's all a part of my long-term deal with buddy Gleafall.

203
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:20,280
There's a lot of cash tied up in this thin,
plus I got this shirt.

204
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,666
I am fat.

205
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:28,080
Bodies change, honey!
Bodies change.

206
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,880
- Oh no, Mabel.
- Mabel's not here.

207
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,230
- She's in sweater town.
- Are you gonna come out of sweater town?

208
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,118
All right. Enough is enough.

209
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:44,910
- If you can't break up with Gideon, than I'll do it for you.
- You will?

210
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,245
- Oh thank you, thank you, thank you
- Allright, allright.

211
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,800
Hello! Dipper Pines, how are you?

212
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,169
- You look good, you look good.
- Thanks, you are..

213
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,662
Look, Gideon. We've gotta talk.
Mabel isn't joining you tonight.

214
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:09,472
She doesn't want to see you anymore.

215
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,548
She's kinda weirded out by you,
no offense.

216
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:15,150
So what you're saying is..

217
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,141
- You've come between us.
- You're not gonna like

218
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:21,122
 freak out or anything, are you?

219
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:25,291
Of course not. This things happen.

220
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,151
So, okay cool. Well, then again, sorry man,
but uh..

221
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,904
Hey, thumbs up!

222
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,158
Thumbs up, indeed my friend.

223
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:38,941
How did it go? Was he mad?
Did he try to read your mind with his psychic powers?

224
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:42,307
Don't worry Mable, he's just a kid.
He doesn't have any powers.

225
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,733
Dipper Pines, you don't know what you've done.

226
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:02,699
You've just made the biggest mistake of your life.

227
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:08,824
Gideon Charles Gleafall, clean up
your room this instant.

228
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,103
I can buy and sell you old man!

229
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:14,454
Fair enough.

230
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:27,184
Hit me dude!

231
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:32,980
- Feels good.
- I'm so glad everything's back to normal.

232
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,725
- Your turn.
- Your tur.. Aw, man.

233
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,066
- Hello?
- Toby Determined, Gravity Falls Gossiper.

234
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,132
Oh, hey man. Sorry for acusing you of murder last week.

235
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,487
Water under the bridge. Saay..

236
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,768
We want to interview you about
whether you've seen anything

237
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,612
unusual in tihs hiertown
ever since you've arrived.

238
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:56,497
Oh! Finally! I thought nobody would ever ask!
I have notes and theories! Aha..

239
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,431
412 Gopher road. Tonight?

240
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,551
- Got it.
- There! I did your dirty work.

241
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:07,840
Now it's time to pay your end of the bargain.

242
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,562
Sandra Himeneses phone number!

243
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,796
Bless you, lil Gideon!

244
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,882
 Hello!

245
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,031
Hello friend.

246
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,916
- Gideon.
- Dipper Pines.

247
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,343
How long have you been lining in
this town? Week? Two?

248
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,347
You like it here? Enjoying the scenery?

249
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,568
- What do you want from me, man?
- Listen carefully boy.

250
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:50,036
This town has secrets you couldn't begin
to comprehend.

251
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,224
Is this about Mabel?
I told you, she's not into you.

252
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,770
Liar! You turned her agains me!

253
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:59,305
She was my peach dumpling!

254
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:00,958
Are you okay man?

255
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:05,600
Howdy!

256
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:08,714
Reading minds isn't all I can do.

257
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:10,528
But..but you're a fake..

258
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,701
Oh, tell me Dipper. Is this fake?

259
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,640
How's your hair tasting buddy?

260
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,462
Wendy, I need some advice.

261
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,993
- You've broken up with guys, right?
- Oh yeah.

262
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:31,029
Russ Toram, Elay Hall, Stoney Davidson.

263
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,691
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

264
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:36,062
I thought everytrhing was back to
normal, but I still feel all gross.

265
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:39,507
Flake Wurly,  Nate Halls, oh, the guy with the tattoos.

266
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:44,156
Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake.
Gideon deserves an honest break up

267
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,439
Deanny Feldman, Mark Epstin, oh.

268
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:50,621
Oh man, I'm not sure I actualy broke up with him.
No wonder he keeps calling me.

269
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:53,632
I know what I gotta do.
Thatnls for talking to me, Wendy.

270
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:58,667
Ignore.

271
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,283
Grunkle Stan was right about you!
You are a monster!

272
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,721
Your sister will be mine!

273
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:21,064
- Who's the cute little guy? You are!
- No you are!

274
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,384
- She's never gonna date you, man!
- That's a lie!

275
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:32,831
And I'm gonna make sure you never lie to me
again, friend.

276
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,178
Gideon! We have to talk!

277
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,305
Mabel! My marshmallow!
What are you doing here?

278
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:50,397
I'm sorry Gideon, but I can't be your marshmallow.
I am here to be honest and tell you that myself.

279
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:53,861
I..I don't understand.

280
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,711
Mabel, this probably isn't the best time
to be brutaly honest with him!

281
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,467
Hey, but we can still be makeover buddies, right?

282
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,783
- Woudn't you like that?
- Really?

283
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:05,924
No! Not really!

284
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,876
- You were like attacking my brother! What the heck?

285
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,284
 My tie! Give it back!

286
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:12,731
Not so powerfull without this, are you?

287
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:13,735
Dipper!

288
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:38,442
Listen Gideon. It's over.
I will never ever date you.

289
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,387
Yeah!

290
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:43,931
My powers!

291
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:51,112
Oh, this isn't over. This isn't the last you'll
see of lil..ol..me.

292
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:57,909
This is living brother.

293
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,499
From now on, it's all named brand foods and
clown paintings.

294
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,139
-  Well hehey Gideon, look what..
- Stanpher Pines!

295
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,721
I rebuke thee!
I rebuke thee!

296
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,715
Rebuke? Is that a word?

297
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,140
The entire Pines family
have invoked my fury!

298
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:22,011
You will all pay recompense
for you transgressions!

299
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,789
What, you got like a
word-a-day calendar or something?

300
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:29,187
B-but-but but sunshine, what about our
arrangement with Mable and..

301
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:29,886
Silence!

302
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:34,110
Well, I see he's taking one of
his rages again.

303
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,160
Sorry, Stan. I'll have to stand with
Gideon on this one.

304
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:41,193
Okay, okay. I can see when
I'm not wanted.

305
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:44,324
Stan, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
that painting back, Staaan!

306
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:45,068
Stan!

307
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:46,586
Try and catch me, suckers!

308
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:52,338
I could've had it all.

309
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,464
What the heck happened to you two?

310
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,830
- Gideon.
- Gideon.

311
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:58,047
Gideon.

312
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:01,416
Yeah, the little mutant swore vengeance
on the whole family.

313
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,705
I guess he's gonna nibble my anckles
or something.

314
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,717
Oh yeah. Yeah! How is he gonna
destroy us now, huh?

315
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:09,936
Try to think what number we're thinking of?

316
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,724
He'll never guess what
number I'm thinking of.

317
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:15,862
Negative 8! Noone would guess a negative number!

318
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:21,640
Oh, look out! Somebody's
planning our destruction right now.

319
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,343
Gideon, I still love you.

320
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:36,067
If only my family weren't in the way.

321
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,314
Look at me.
I'm old and I'm smelly.

322
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:45,645
Hey, what are you going to do without
your precious amulet?

323
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,841
Oh, you'll see boy.

324
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:51,455
You'll see.

325
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,092
- You're done.
- Not yet.

326
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,391
- How about now?
- Almost.

327
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,825
And.. there.

328
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:02,985
Let's do this.

329
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:21,429
You're all fired.

330
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:22,724
Два парня и корыто
