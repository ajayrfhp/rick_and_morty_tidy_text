off the wrappers.

Hey, no sweat, dude.

I'd do anything
for the Pines family.

39
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,318
I need to scratch myself
in two places at once.

And I mean  <i>anything.</i>

Coming, Mr. Pines!

42
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,192
Whoa, better make sure
he gets his wallet back.

43
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,362
Wait, I've never seen
Soos's wallet before.

44
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,198
Don't you want to learn
some Soos secrets?

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,333
I don't know if we should be--
Whoa!

46
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,669
Soos has a membership
to laser tag?

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,371
I didn't know they let
grown-ups in there.

48
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,207
And look,
emergency salami.

49
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,910

00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,350
That's today.

54
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,218
Whoa.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,319
That's weird.

56
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,453
I wonder
why he didn't tell anyone.

57
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,922
Uh, duh.

58
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,256
It's probably because
he wants someone

59
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,192
to throw him
a surprise party.

60
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,762
I've been waiting for
a surprise party my whole life.

61
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,330
Surprise!

62
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,366
Too little, too late, Chiu.

Wow, you guys

Grenda, twins are born

All right, you promised
a giant hummingbird,

Oh, no.

Oh, no, no, no.

his birthday.

BOTH: What?
It's a total mystery.

I guess he's been like this
since he was a kid.

We've tried everything.

105
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,156
I even petitioned
the government

106
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,858
to have this day removed
from calendars.

107

maybe we should just
leave him alone, you know?

111
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,569
No one should be alone
on their birthday.

112
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,305
There's got to be a way
to cheer him up.

113

We just need to try harder.

00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,551
Blondin?

166
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,619
BlarBlar.

167
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,720
There it is.

168
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,754
It's Blendin!

169
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,990
Blendin Blenjamin Blendin.

170
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,592
How could you not know my name
after you ruined my life?!

171
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,462
Initiate flashback!

172
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,697
<i>It was after you</i>
<i>stole my time device</i>

173
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,466
<i>to win your stupid pig.</i>

174
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,402
<i>I was cast out of</i>
<i>the time anomaly removal crew--</i>

175
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,137
my whole life's purpose.

176
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,405
And then I was given

177
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,074
<i>ten squared life sentences</i>
<i>in time prison.</i>

178
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,077
I've spent every day since then
<i>planning my vengeance.</i>

179
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,983
And now finally,
it has come!

180
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,251
Look, we're sorry
about all that,

181
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,419
but we're in the middle
of something

182
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,954
really important
right now.

183
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,322
It's our friend's
birthday today,

184
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,224
and we promised
we wouldn't leave his side.

185
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,360
What?! You think some dumb
birthday matters right now?

186
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,962
Do you know where you are?

187
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,065
Welcome to Globnar!

188
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,642
<i>MABEL:</i>
<i>Is this a reality show?</i>

189
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,544
<i>Are we in Japan?</i>

190
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:03,448
<i>BLENDIN:</i>

00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,092
N-n-no!
Please!

195
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,062
( screaming )

196
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,266
And the two of you
are officially challenged.

197
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,367
Dundgren!

198
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,069
Get me my war paint.

199
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,403
Dipper, we need a way
out of here.

200
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,338
But how?

201
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,408
I have an idea.

202
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,444
Hang in there, Soos,
we're coming for you.

203
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,479
Dipper?
Mabel?

204
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,547
Requesting back-up.

205
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,648
Ah! Ah!

206
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,316
Oh! Ah!
Oh, no.

207
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,285
( chuckles )
Laser Robbie.

208
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,420
Dudes?

209
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,722
( bell rings )

210
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,323
( Mabel clearing throat )

211
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,791
Oh, my stars.

212
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,327
Could it be my little, um...

213
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,263
Lolphy!

214
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:59,271
Your great-great-great-great-
great-great-great grandmother

215
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,473
from the past times.

216
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,109
Gam-Gam?

217
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,511
Yeah, neon green is good.

218
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,779
This is a good color for me.

219
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,780
It's fierce--
Huh?

220
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,081
What?
No!

221
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,249
You can't let them escape!

222
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,584
Stop there!

223
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,386
Gam-Gam, how could you?

224
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,088
I ain't no one's Gam-Gam,
sucka!

225
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,757
You just got time tricked!

226
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,393
No!
No!

227
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,361
Hurry!
Back to Soos' birthday.

228
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,764
Okay.
I think I've got it.

229
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,369
( screaming )

230
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,305
Uhh. Are we back?

231
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:36,441
Oh, no! Look!

232
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,376
Mable, the Laser place
is a mattress store.

233
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,145
We went too far
in the past.

234
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,313
Time travel.

235
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,249
Man, why you gotta be
so complicated?

236
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,217
Huh?!

237
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,154
Looks like they overshot
their destination by 10 years.

238
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,523
I don't see them.
You better find those kids!

239
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,358
You'll get your justice,
Blendin.

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,694
I'm gonna keep stammering
until you find them.

241
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,397
I-I-I-I...

242
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,466
I hate that guy.
Let's move.

243
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,538
Yeah!
Yeah!

244
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,640
Okay, we just got
to go forward 10 years.

245
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,543
We can be back before Soos
even realizes we were gone.

246
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,778
Oh, no!
The timey thing.

247
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,180
It's busted.

248
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,414
Can you fix it?

249
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,416
Maybe.
I'll need some tools.

250
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,153
And I think I know
where to get some.

251
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,290
Let's try to lay low.

252
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,725
We don't want to change
the future.

253
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,560
Or  <i>cause </i> the future.

254
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,261
I forget how this works
exactly.

255
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,263
Wow, 10 years in the past.

256
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,333
Everything is samey
but also differenty.

257
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,535
♪ Doppity-doppity-doo

258
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,637
Yeah!

259

Look out Broadway,
here I come.

260
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,577
This dream goes nowhere,

Whoa.
Oops. Sorry.

Oh, my gosh.

( chuckles )
Thank you.

268
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,493
I mean you're super young,
so this is weird.

269
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,495
Now you know
how  <i>she </i> feels, creep.

270
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,597
( chuckles )
Yeah, I... Huh.

271
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,165
Wow.

272
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,833
Wow.

273
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,603
STAN: Schlep right up,
ladies and gentlemen,

274
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,171
to see my latest attraction.

275
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,439
All right, the coast is clear.

276
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,708
Now is our chance.

277
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,648
Ha!
Bingo!

278
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,350
All right, let's see.

279
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,618
BOY: Aw, come on, candy.

280
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,787
Fall. Fall.

281
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,321
Allow me.

282
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,357
You just need to know
a guy on the inside.

283

Bippity-boop-womp!

00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,527

( gasps )

286
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,630
Thanks, dawg.

287
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,266
You must be
some kind of genius

288
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,401
All right, I think
I've got this thing working

289
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,270
Dipper, Dipper, look.

290
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,205
No way.

291
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,543
Mi precioso,
you keep wandering off.

292
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,378
You don't want to be
late for your big day.

293
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,513
Sorry, Abuelita.

294
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,648
Big day?

295
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,982
This could be
the birthday

296
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,951
where that personal biz
went down.

297
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,921
We could finally find out
why Soos hates his birthday.

298
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,956
All right,
but let's be quick.

299
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,358
KID: I want a piece
of birthday cake!

300
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,527
( kids giggling )

301
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,963
Who's a handsome birthday boy?

302
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,732
(sing-song) It's you!

303
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,401
( giggles ) Soos, you are
such a ladies' man.

304
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,470
They're my cousins,
Grandma. Gross.

305
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,371
I got you a race car cake.

306
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,440
Man, I don't know
why Soos hates his birthdays.

307
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,508
This looks great.

308
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,345
Sorry, dude,
but could you move seats?

309
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,313
That's the seat of honor.

310
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,848
Uh, who's it for?

311
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,684
Oh. Heh.
It's for my dad, actually.

312
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,887
I haven't seen him in, like,
8 years, but he's coming today.

313
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,022
( door bell rings )
That must be him!

314
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,466
(inhales, exhales)
All right, Soos,
today's the big day.

315
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,535
Be cool.
Be cool.

316
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,639
Postcard for...

317
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,674
Soos.

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,683
Dad."

321
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,819
Hey, don't sweat it, cuz.

322
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,020
You'll see him next year.

323
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,056
Ha. Yeah, next year.

324
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,462
I'm gonna go lay down.

325
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,830
You party without me,
dudes.

326
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,298
Wait, what about
your presents?

327
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,466
TOY:  <i>Yay-uh.</i>

328
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,938
So that's why
Soos hates his birthday.

329
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,641
It's the day he realized
his dad wasn't coming back.

330
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,710
So how much partying
can fix that?

331
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:33,945
( giggles )
Dorks.

332
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,380
Young Robbie.

333
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,819
Ay, Soos' father
is a dead-beat.

334
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,886
( speaking Spanish )

335
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,890
( clears throat )

336
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,495
Soos, I made you cookies
shaped like dinosaurs.

337
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,496
I don't want cookies.

338
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,697
I want to see Dad again.

339
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,032
And he wants to see you.

340
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,100
He's just...busy.

341
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,368
Busy in New Orleans?

342
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,037
Ay. Yes.

343
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,440
Trust me,
you will feel better one day.

344
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,377
Ohh, this is awful.

345
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,946
We promised Soos
a happy birthday,

346
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,781
but how can we
give him that now?

347
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,950
This goes beyond anything
we know how to fix.

348
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,118
BLENDIN: This way!
Mabel, hide!

349
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,890
They've got to be
around here somewhere.

350
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,458
I think I heard them!

351
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,094
( bird chirping )
Freeze!

352
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,696
( crying )

353
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,798
Trace their chrono-signatures.

354
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,101
Man, the sooner I defeat
those kids in Globnar,

355
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,136
the sooner
I can win my time wish.

356
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,138
Tell you what I'd do
if I had a time wish.

357
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,541
Retire early,
spend more time with the kids.

358
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,676
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah
with the kids?!

359
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,479
Don't you know a time wish
can literally do anything?

360
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,449
Any impossible problem solved,
just like that.

361
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,950
I mean,
imagine the possibilities.

362
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,119
Wait, Mabel, that's it,
the time wish.

363
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,021
If we defeat Blendin
in that space battle--

364
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,389
Then we can wish

365
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,524
that Soos' dad
came to his 12th birthday.

366
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,159
And Soos' birthdays
would be fixed forever--

367
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:59,063
But do you really think
we can win Globnar?

368
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,798
It's the only chance we have.

369
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,468
Besides, it's for Soos.

370
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,904
He would do the same for us.

371
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,642
Here we are, Blendin.
We surrender.

372
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,510
It's them!
Freeze!

373
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,880
They might have powder muskets
or slap bracelets.

374
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,515
Look, guys,
no tricks this time.

375
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,117
We're ready to challenge you,
okay?

376
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,619
Yes!
Let the Globnar begin.

377
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,089
Prepare for Globnar!!!

378
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,158
( silence )

379
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,826
Hey, turns out
I can mute him.

380
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,595
Man, I wish
we'd known that earlier.

381
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,563
Initializing.

382
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,502
( crowd cheering )

383
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:44,042
Globnar! Globnar!
Globnar! Globnar!

384
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,486
Silence!

385
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,955
Whoo!
Oh, yeah!

386
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,925
That is one big baby.

387
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,894
Welcome, Globnar tributes.

388
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,829
I have
a very important nap to get to,

389
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,230
so let's make this quick.

390
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,733
You each have a chance
to settle your time-feud

391
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,069
through gladiatorial combat.

392
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,071
<i>ROBOT: You will have</i>
<i>until time baby finishes</i>

393
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,740
<i>drinking the cosmic sand</i>
<i>in this hourglass.</i>

394
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,008
No!

395
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,209
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>It's good for you.</i>

396
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,577
Waah!

397
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,012
Get ready, kids.

398
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,181
When I get that time wish,
you'll wish you were never born.

399
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,483
Or rather,
you'll wish you  <i>were </i> born,

400
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,185
because I'm gonna wish
you were never born!

401
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,053
Dream on!
There's two of us.

402
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,755
<i>And </i> we have hair!

403
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,923
Oh--oh, yeah?

404
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,025
Well, I have training!

405
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,062
What do you think I did
in prison all that time?

406
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,063
Uh-oh.

407
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,833
Let the Globnar begin!

408
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,534
( crowd cheers )

409
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,802
( buzzer )

410
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,074
( roars )

411
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,510
( grunting )

412
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,091
Yeah!

413
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,831
( roaring )

414
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,239
<i>Globnar!</i>

415
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,776
Very good.

416
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,011
You have escaped
the Cyclocks.

417
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,714
Yes!
Blendin for the almost-win!

418
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,152
There is only one
final challenge for Globnar.

419
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,288
An ancient game,
thousands of years old,

420
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,925
chosen for its exemplification
of pure strategy.

421
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,595
The ancient art of laser tag!

422
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,234
The one who touches
the victory orb first will win.

423
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,304
Laser tag?
Seriously?

424
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,673
Oh, I know it doesn't seem
that challenging now,

425
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,176
but just wait until they
turn on that fog machine.

426
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,310
You'll be done for.

427
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,645
You just wait until you--

428
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,746
<i>MACHINE: Hit.</i>

429
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,848
<i>Hit, hit, hit, hit.</i>

430
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,849
Oh, man.

431
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,184
Mabel, grab the orb!

432
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:06,984
Got it.

433
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,356
It is finished!

434
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:15,893
( burps )

435
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,261
( cheering )

436
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,031
( buzzer )
No!

437
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,066
No! No!
Yes!
Yes!

438
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,902
You have made victory
in Globnar.

439
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,838
Before I give you
your time wish,

440
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,675
tell us what fate
do you decide for the loser?

441
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,210
Oh, jeez.

442
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,212
Death!

443
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,780
Mabel.
Sorry.

444
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,248
Got carried away.

445
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,852
So Blendin did try
to wish us out of existence,

446
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,187
but it was kind of our fault
for ruining his life.

447
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,858
Yeah, and he's kind of too sad
to be a real bad guy.

448
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,826
Maybe if we treat him right
in the present,

449
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,661
he'll turn out better
in the future.

450
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,864
Okay, as long as you keep
an eye on him,

451
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,933
we'd like to set Blendin free
and restore his position

452
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,702
at the Time Anomaly
Correction Unit.

453
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,837
And give him pretty hair.

454
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,305
So be it.

455
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,376
What?
You'd do that for me?

456
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,245
I got my job back!

457
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,980
I feel like hugging somebody.

458
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,382
I can kill you
in eight different ways.
Yes, sir.

459
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:16,687
Now, children, what is it that
you want for your time wish?

460
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,191
Thank you,
but the wish isn't for us.

461
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,425
Not you?

462
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,361
But then who?

463
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,764
Who is worthy
to receive such power?

464
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,667
Dipper?
Mabel?

465
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,002
Ah, who am I kidding?

466
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,336
I'm not up for this.

467
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,106
Heads, I stay.

468
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,708
Tails, I go make myself
some dinosaur shaped cookies.

469
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,379
( laughter slows down )

470
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,817
Huh. That's unconventional.

471
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,123
BOTH: Soos!
Guys!

472
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,225
We're so sorry
we left you hanging, dude.

473
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,394
We got caught up
in this time travel junk.

474
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,196
And there was a time Cyclops.

475
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,197
And don't forget
about the

476
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,264
time race.
Time race.

477
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,200
But the point is, Soos,

478
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,235
we think we know
how to fix your birthday.

479
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,870
Whoa. Really?

480
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,040
Wait, you guys did
all of that for me?

481
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,274
And that's not all.

482
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,010
Behold your time wish,

483
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:17,315
the power to alter time,
paradox-free,
in any way you choose.

484
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,951
We think the only thing
that can make you happy
is meeting your dad.

485
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,485
But the choice is yours.

486
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,222
You mean, I can finally see
my dad by touching this thing?

487
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,257
And you guys battled
through time and space

488
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,858
just to get this for me?

489
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,230
What are you waiting for,
Soos?

490
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,399
All right.
Here goes nothing.

491
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,438
( gasps )

492
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,439
Wait, what?
What the...

493
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,940
Bam!
Fixed you up.

494
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,177
But, Soos, what about
meeting your dad?

495
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,379
Well, birthdays
are supposed to be spent

496
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,947
with the people
who care about you.

497
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,382
But you know what?

498
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,317
That dude didn't care about me
enough to visit me once,

499
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,287
let alone fight monsters through
time and space like you dudes.

500
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,123
I mean, you had
a gladiator fight
just to make me happy.

501
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,158
I've been being ridiculous
this whole time.

502
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,261
Whoever my dad was,
he could take a hike.

503
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,397
I know who my family is now,
and it's you dudes.

504
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,000
Thanks for giving me
the best birthday ever.

505
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,835
Are you kidding me?!

506
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,004
Do you have any idea
what you've just wasted?

507
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,206
Do you know how many
have died to get a time wish?

508
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,341
The wars
that were started?

509
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,211
I also wished for
the slice of infinite pizza.

510
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,345
Watch.

511
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,283
And it can do that for,
like, infinity.

512
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,517
( indistinct )

513
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,286
Phew!
That's a good time wish.

514
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,254
There's still 10 minutes
before laser tag closes.

515
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,255
You dudes want to play?

516
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,390
Yeah.

517
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,958
( giggling )

518
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,193
DIPPER & MABEL:
Happy birthday, Soos.

519
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,362
Whoa.
Thought I heard an explosion.

520
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,263
Whoa, what's this?

521
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,533
Mystery Shack?

522
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,901
That is it!

523
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,202
You are single-handedly

524
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,172
the worst handyman
I've ever seen.

525
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,874
Uh, hey, excuse me, sir.

526
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,476
Hey you, gumdrop,
think you can fix a golf cart?

527
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,278
Well, I don't know if I--

528
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,313
Boom, you're hired.

529
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,381
One size fits all.

530
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,216
Step right up
to the Mystery Shack, folks.

531
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,318
Step right up.
