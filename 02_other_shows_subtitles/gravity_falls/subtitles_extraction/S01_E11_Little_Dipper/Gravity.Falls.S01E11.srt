1
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,021
"Zombie attack"?

2
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:08,189
Never works. They don't take orders.

3
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:10,193
"Blood rain"? Ew. Mess up my suit.

4
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,996
Ha. No, thank you.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,334
"Demon caterpillars"? Snap!

6
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:17,372
There must be a perfect way to exact vengeance on the Pines family.

7
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,040
It's not enough to harm 'em.

8
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:20,375
I need to take somethin' from 'em,

9
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,213
Somethin' that will give me ultimate power.

10
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:24,908
Wait, of course!

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,989
It's perfect.

12
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,464
You've gone too far this time, Ducktective.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,372
Welcome to a world of mystery--

14
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,041
Stan Pines?

15
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,246
The tax collector! You found me!

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,415
Uhh!

17
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,390
Which one of these is the trap door?

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,358
Mr. Pines...

19
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:54,095
I'm from the winninghouse coupon savers contest,

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,333
And you are our big winner!

21
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,140
Heh?

22
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,300
My one and only dream,

23
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:05,275
Which was to possess money, has come true!

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,146
We're rich! I'm gonna get a butler!

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,547
I'm gonna buy a talking horse!

26
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:10,316
Just sign here for the money.

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,317
You bet!

28
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,185
Uhh! Ha!

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,520
Stanford, you fool!

30
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:19,459
You just signed over the mystery shack to widdle ol' me!

31
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,194
Achacha cha cha

32
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,462
liddle ol' me.

33
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:25,365
Ah, might wanna take another look there.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,436
"The shack is hereby signed over to...

35
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,138
Suck a lemon, little man."

36
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:32,372
Ahhh ha-ha-ha!

37
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:34,408
Uhh! How dare you!

38
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:38,278
I am not a threat to be taken lightly!

39
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:39,480
Unh unh!

40
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:42,551
Come here, hon, I need your arms.

41
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:44,587
I'll get you, Stanford Pines.

42
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,487
I'll get you all!

43
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:50,153
Want to see what else is on tv?

44
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:51,322
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right.

45
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,159
Should be fun. My favorite part's the theme song.

46
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,632
Little guy to black space nine.

47
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,433
It's a "Pawn," That's not your color,

48
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,533
And stop stealing the tiny horses.

49
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,434
They like it better in here.

50
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,503
Don't you, babies?

51
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:48,207
And... Checkmate!

52
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,343
What? Boo!

53
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,313
Ohh! Dipper wins again!

54
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,183
Yo, Mabel, can you pass me that brain in the jar?

55
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,584
The lady one. I got it.

56
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,350
Thanks, but Mabel's taller.

57
00:02:58,385 --> 00:02:59,517
What? No, she's not.

58
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,518
We're the same height. We've always been.

59
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:03,321
Better check again, dude.

60
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:13,097
Yup. She's got exactly one millimeter on you.

61
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,165
What?! Whoa...

62
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,466
Don't you see what's happening, Dipper?

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,568
This millimeter is just the beginning.

64
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,505
I'm evolving into the superior sibling.

65
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,539
Bigger...

66
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,240
Stronger...

67
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:24,441
Like some kind of alpha twin.

68
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:27,410
Alpha twin! Alpha twin!

69
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:30,146
C'mon, guys, nobody even uses millimeters.

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,148
It only makes you taller than me in Canada.

71
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,317
You know, Dipper, I've always wanted a little brother.

72
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,253
Who knew I already had one!

73
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:38,357
Hahaha! Yeah!

74
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,326
I was awoken by the sound of mockery.

75
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,326
Where is it?

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,559
Show me the object of ridicule!

77
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:45,424
I'm taller than Dipper. By one millimeter!

78
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,126
Hey, hey. Don't get...Short with your sister.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,260
Hahahahah!

80
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,295
Now, Grunkle Stan...

81
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,597
I hope you don't think...Little of him!

82
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,166
Haha! Yeah! And, and, uh...

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,167
He's short!

84
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,300
Hahahaha! Hahahaha!

85
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:59,234
Dudes, maybe you should lay off a tiny bit.

86
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:02,167
Hah! "Tiny!" Soos is in on it now!

87
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,336
Ahahahahahhaha! Ahahahahahhaha!

88
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,071
No, I didn't mean that.

89
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:07,139
Dipper will forget.

90
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,306
He's got a--3-2-1...

91
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,407
Short-term memory!

92
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:11,408
Hahah! Hahah!

93
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,111
Pow! We are on fire!

94
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,513
Ow...Ooh... That's...Aww...

95
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,482
I high-five hard.

96
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,220
Ugh... Stupid Mabel.

97
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,488
I'm not short!

98
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,390
Unh. Unh. Oh, come on!

99
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,258
Unh. Unh.

100
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,360
There's gotta be some way to get taller.

101
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,163
Let's see...

102
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:37,500
"Legends of miniature buffalo and giant squirrels

103
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,270
"Have led me to believe

104
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:39,505
"There are height-altering properties

105
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,309
hidden deep within the forest."

106
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,309
Hmm...

107
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:44,476
Unh! Whoa!

108
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,145
Ohh ow ow oh ow ow.

109
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,480
Ugh.

110
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,382
Ohh.

111
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,357
Whoa.

112
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,161
Huh?

113
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,160
huh!

114
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:08,329
Is that mountain lion tiny or just far away in perspective?

115
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:12,267
Perspective! Perspective! Aah!

116
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,440
Oof! Hahaha!

117
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,313
It still hurts, but less!

118
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,256
Whoa.

119
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,432
What the heck.

120
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,236
Unh.

121
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,309
Smaller.

122
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,409
Bigger.

123
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,478
Too big!

124
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,313
I've been buying big clothes.

125
00:05:58,348 --> 00:05:59,548
I'll grow into them.

126
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:02,418
Hey, guys. Notice anything different about me?

127
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:04,322
Holy hot sauce!

128
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:05,523
You've grown an extra millimeter!

129
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,159
Wha-wha-whhaaat?

130
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:12,533
What can I say, sis? Growth spurt.

131
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:14,501
Eh, mine happened first.

132
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:16,271
I'm gonna be taller in the end.

133
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,473
It's science, Dipper.

134
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,410
What? But we're the same height now.

135
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,117
Alpha twin! Alpha twin!

136
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:23,486
Oh, yeah?

137
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,740
Something tells me I've

138
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,127
got another growth spurt coming on right now.

139
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,135
Give it up, Dipper.

140
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,374
What happened!?

141
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,346
You know... Puberty and stuff.

142
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,184
It doesn't make any sense!

143
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:43,186
Just a second ago you were-- wait a minute.

144
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,389
This is some kind of magicky thing, isn't it?

145
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:47,193
Was it a wizard or something?

146
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,462
There's a wizard in this closet,

147
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:51,201
Isn't there? Isn't there? What? No!

148
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,503
You're telling me there is not a wizard in this closet?

149
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:56,609
You're telling me that if I open this door right now--

150
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:57,612
Fine! Open it!

151
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:04,383
An invisible wizard! Really, Dipper?

152
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,521
Oy. You.

153
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,527
Howdy, Stanford! Listen closely.

154
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:15,166
Inside this jar, I have 1,000 cursed Egyptian super termites.

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Hand over the deed to your property

156
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,400
Or I'll smash this jar with a bat

157
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:21,405
And they'll devour the shack with you inside.

158
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,508
Hey, what's that? Huh?

159
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,343
oh, no!

160
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,375
Aaahh! Get it off!

161
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:29,242
Ha ha ha! Hey, soos, get in here!

162
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,509
I wanna take pictures of this!

163
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,412
You may have won the battle,

164
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:34,482
But mark my words, Stanford,

165
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:38,153
Your family has a weak spot, and I'm gonna to find it.

166
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,158
Aaughh! My hair!

167
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,163
Does he only respond to incantations?

168
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:44,199
Expecto wizarium!

169
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,601
Wizzle... Wizar...

170
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,170
It's not a wizard!

171
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:49,341
I grew myself using this magic flashlight!

172
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,511
Let me see that thing!

173
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,148
Auugh!

174
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,353
I'll be back for you later!

175
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,622
Ahhh! Oof!

176
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:00,561
Whoa! Huh?

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,134
Huh? Uhh. Huh?

178
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,137
Aah!

179
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:12,404
It's okay. It can shrink things, too.

180
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,273
Normal-hand-karate-chop!

181
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,274
Hey!

182
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:23,117
Aaaaagh!

183
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,585
Wha?!

184
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:25,586
Ohhh!

185
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,188
Hey, give it back!

186
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,458
Whoa! Never!

187
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,232
Curse the pines family!

188
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,166
Curse stan! Curse dipper!

189
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,399
Curse....

190
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,533
My, my,

191
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,566
What delightful manner of doohickery is this?

192
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,169
Maybe he didn't see us use it

193
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:44,537
And doesn't know it's a magic flashlight

194
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,406
That can grow and shrink things.

195
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,342
Really?

196
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:50,545
Click. Boop. Hoo hoo.

197
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,345
No, no, no, no!!!

198
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,445
Aah! Aah!

199
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,252
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

200
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,186
Friends, I wish I was a highway

201
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,188
so I could have the honor of being rode upon

202
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:17,091
by automobiles as fine as these ones right ch'er.

203
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,293
Engine possum at no extra charge.

204
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,193
I want that thar car!

205
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:24,236
Yeah, me, too!

206
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,539
Say there, son, what's in the jar?

207
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,308
That's my widdle secret!

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,243
Ahh!

209
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,547
Mouth-breathing fools.

210
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,518
Mother.

211
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:47,561
You two.

212
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,530
What-- what are you going to do with us?

213
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:54,199
Why, Mabel, I wouldn't hurt a hair on your itty bitty head.

214
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,336
If you agree to be my queen!

215
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,138
We live in a democracy.

216
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,238
And never!

217
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:02,273
Maybe you'll change your mind after this.

218
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:05,242
No! I will fight you until the day I...

219
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:08,378
gummy koalas!

220
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,284
As for you, boy...

221
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,451
Tell me,

222
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,187
How exactly did you come upon this magic item, hmm?

223
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,521
Did somebody tell you about it?

224
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:22,356
Did you read about it somewhere?

225
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,156
Lean closer and I'll tell you.

226
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,357
well, don't mind if I--

227
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,394
aah!

228
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,499
Grrr!

229
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,499
I could squash you right now!!

230
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,336
Steel yourself, Gideon.

231
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,238
You can use them.

232
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,307
You can use them.

233
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,473
Soos, this maze of mirrors is your best idea

234
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,273
that I'm taking credit for yet!

235
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,140
We're gonna make a fortune!

236
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:53,609
My ears always been this big?

237
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:57,182
I'm comin'!

238
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:03,162
One day...

239
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,397
Stanford Pines.

240
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,499
Listen to me very closely, I have your niece and nephew.

241
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,099
Hand over the deed to the mystery shack right now

242
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:13,468
Or great harm will befall them.

243
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,105
This is Gideon, by the way.

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,474
Oh, yeah. This has gotta be your worst plot yet.

245
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:19,541
They're fine.

246
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,110
I saw them playing in the yard minutes ago.

247
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:23,311
I have them in my possession.

248
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:24,278
You don't believe me?!

249
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,244
I will text you a photo.

250
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,380
"Text" me a "photo"?

251
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,581
Now you're not even speaking English.

252
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,249
But--

253
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:32,550
Hello? Hello?!

254
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:34,585
Gahhhh!

255
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:36,184
Aah.

256
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,284
What am I doing?

257
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,454
I don't need ransom. I have this!

258
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:49,390
I'll shrink Stan and take the shack for myself!

259
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,325
You'll all be helpless to stop me.

260
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,429
And if any of you step out of line... Smash!

261
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,233
Gideon!

262
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,568
The ice cream truck is here!

263
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:06,140
Oh! Coming! Hehehe!

264
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,080
Guard them, cheekums.

265
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm coming!

266
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,127
We got to get out of here and save Stan.

267
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:23,195
I know!

268
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,164
I will see you later.

269
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,433
Ok, how are we going to do this?

270
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:29,539
Gideon's got magic and like a zillion inches on us.

271
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,513
On the bright side, at least we're finally the same height again.

272
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,381
Actually...

273
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,188
You're still taller?!

274
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:42,557
Argh! How did this happen?

275
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:45,128
I guess it's another mystery.

276
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,564
Just another reason we gotta get that flashlight back.

277
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,538
Cheekums, to freedom!

278
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,307
To freedom!

279
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,509
Ohh!

280
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:01,246
You're just a big ol' dummy-dum!

281
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,582
I have a plan.

282
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:21,236
Clean me!

283
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,206
Father, could you give widdle ol' me

284
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,177
a "wide" to the mystery shack?

285
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:27,546
Ohhh, I'd love to, sugar pie,

286
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:31,255
But I have a heck of a lot of cars to sell, I do.

287
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,126
No, no! Don't tickle me!

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,428
No!

289
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,330
Never! Never tickle me!

290
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,330
What have I told you?

291
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:41,498
What have I-- look at me.

292
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:42,566
What have I told you?

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,170
Tickling is no laughing matter.

294
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:46,405
There we go.

295
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,143
Do you still need a ride?

296
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,579
I'll just take the bus!

297
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,481
Raah!

298
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:52,616
Hyah!

299
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,222
Precious memories.

300
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,325
Just keep vacuuming... Just keep vacuuming.

301
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,493
C'mon! Uhh.

302
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,235
We need to get higher.

303
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,501
Yeah, especially you 'cause you're short.

304
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,169
Mabel! Up there.

305
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,475
Uhh. Unh.

306
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,479
What cute little thing are you off to,

307
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:22,181
You cute little cutey-face?

308
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:26,286
I'm going to annihilate my archenemy's entire family!

309
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:29,125
Ohh! Okay!

310
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,393
Yaayyy.

311
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:35,501
He's heading to shrink Stan!

312
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,569
Oh, flying discount dollar,

313
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,440
If only you could fly us back to the mystery shack.

314
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,310
Maybe it can.

315
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:45,315
Oh! Oh!

316
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,487
My sky-high prices!

317
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:52,556
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

318
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,225
Down there!

319
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,460
Uhh. Uhh.

320
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,597
Yay! Whoo!

321
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,530
To the mystery shack!

322
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,329
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

323
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:05,264
Yeah! Yeah!

324
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:09,573
We're just in time.

325
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,342
But how are we going to stop him?

326
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:15,543
Aah! Shoo! Aah! Aah! Ow, ow.

327
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,449
Leave that to Mabel!

328
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:27,158
I'm comin' for ya, Stanford-- ohh!

329
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,295
I'm sorry, gummy friend!

330
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,463
It's for the greater good.

331
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,266
Ow! One of those infernal gummy koalas

332
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,501
Has gotten into my perfect hair!

333
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,169
Ew! Aw!

334
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,306
I can't defeat Stan looking like this!

335
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:44,312
Unh. Whoo! Ha. Whoo-ee!

336
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:46,415
Quick. Get in front and I'll re-grow you.

337
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:47,617
Okay-- wait.

338
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:50,189
You're gonna grow us back to the equal height, right?

339
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:51,558
Dipper, that doesn't matter right now!

340
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:54,162
Well, if it doesn't matter, then why don't you just do it?

341
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:56,164
Aah! Why are you acting so weird?

342
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,235
Why can't you just accept that I'm a little bit taller than you?

343
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,436
Oh, I'm acting weird?!

344
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,408
You're the one who keeps calling me names and stuff!

345
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,377
Oh, what? You mean like little--

346
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:06,377
Don't say it!

347
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,112
Little Dipper.

348
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,546
aah!

349
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:12,148
I daresay you would have defeated me,

350
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,250
If it wasn't for your sibling bickering!

351
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:21,124
Aah! The shack is mine, stanford pines!

352
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,559
No!

353
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,389
Well, well, Stanford,

354
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,322
It appears I've finally gotten the best of--

355
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,323
- Huh? - What?

356
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,126
All right, something's definitely different here.

357
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,128
Uhh! Ohh!

358
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,133
Whoa! Whoa!

359
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,302
Tell me where Stan is!

360
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,307
Never! You'll never find Stan.

361
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,176
On the second door to the left down the hall.

362
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,379
Uh, wait, why did I say that?

363
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:48,319
Stanford, I'm coming for ya!

364
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,223
Pffft!

365
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:56,056
I guess I kinda Soosed that one up, didn't I?

366
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,189
It's not your fault, soos.

367
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,356
I'm the guy who put together that shrinking device.

368
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,524
I guess it's just...

369
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,396
You kept teasing me, Mabel. Like, all day.

370
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,066
What was that all about?

371
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,436
I guess it's that...

372
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,206
You're better than me at like everything.

373
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,443
And you always rub it in my face.

374
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:16,283
Chess, checkers, ping pong.

375
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:21,323
I guess I finally felt like I was winning at something for once.

376
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:24,425
Aw, man, now I feel like a big jerk.

377
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,294
Don't you mean... A little jerk?

378
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,295
Ohh!

379
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,401
All right, I walked into that one.

380
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:32,470
Are we cool?

381
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,074
We're cool.

382
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,110
Am I cool?

383
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,246
You're cool, soos.

384
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,316
Yes!

385
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,154
Stanford!

386
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,489
Oh, hi, Gideon!

387
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:46,225
I've been looking for someone to try out my new mirror maze.

388
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,258
Then again, you're an idiot.

389
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,160
That's the end of the sentence.

390
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,295
You come back here!

391
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,233
Try and find me, twerp. Ha ha ha!

392
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,399
Unh!

393
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,101
Let's get that flashlight before Gideon gets Stan.

394
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,205
There it is!

395
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:09,010
Whoa, his hair's so shiny.

396
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,045
No! Don't look directly at it!

397
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,080
This neck is really squishy.

398
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,179
Hey, look! I'm making fat angels!

399
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,048
Ew! Termites!

400
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,320
Tell my story!

401
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:22,321
Ohh.

402
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:26,025
Hey, there you are!

403
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,362
Thought you could get away from me, eh, corn chip?

404
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,509
Ehhhh! Oh! Oh!

405
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,042
Aah! Uhh!

406
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,342
Ah ha ha ha!

407
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,043
No!

408
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:49,378
Hey, watch the merchandise!

409
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,316
You little troll!

410
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,085
These mirrors cost me ten--

411
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,386
I mean, uh, twenty-- five-- five hundred--

412
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,520
Five hundred dollars each.

413
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,221
And you're paying for all of 'em!

414
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:06,288
Au contraire,

415
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,156
It'll be you who pays.

416
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,289
Grunkle Stan is doomed!

417
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,764
Not completely doomed! To his armpit!

418
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:12,730
Uh-uh.

419
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,565
Just...Unh, c'mon!

420
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:16,934
Whoa, what is that thing?

421
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:20,806
Finally, after all these years, after every humiliation!

422
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,909
Your business, your family, everything will finally be mine!

423
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,843
You have no one to protect you now!

424
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:29,543
Prepare for the wrath of Gideon glee...

425
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,843
Gideon glee..

426
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:38,513
Uh, I don't even know how to respond to this.

427
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:39,714
Hee hee, no!

428
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,583
stop it!

429
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:42,818
Look, uh, kid.

430
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,886
I think this rivalry thing is getting to you.

431
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:46,621
Ha. I understand.

432
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,756
I mean, I'm a formidable foe, what can I say.

433
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,891
No--ah hahahahah!

434
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:52,956
Hey, now. Come on.

435
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,756
You'll get me one of these days.

436
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,623
Maybe, you know, run your evil plan

437
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,658
by some friends next time, huh?

438
00:19:58,692 --> 00:19:59,759
Workshop it.

439
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,663
But first get your issues in order there.

440
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,702
Get...Up, up.

441
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,636
Over the carpet, there we go.

442
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:10,803
Uhh. Around the end table,

443
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,503
And, uh, out the door.

444
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:13,671
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

445
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:17,541
My light...

446
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,543
You're the light of my life, too, pal.

447
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,513
Whoo! Freak show.

448
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,617
After you.

449
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:29,755
It's okay. You can go first if you want-- whoa!

450
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:39,728
Hey! You let me keep my extra millimeter.

451
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:40,730
You earned it.

452
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:42,968
Ah, thanks, "Little brother"--

453
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,003
Stop it.

454
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:46,006
I guess we should destroy this thing.

455
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,877
You know, so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands and junk.

456
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,649
Seems like the smart thing to do.

457
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:53,685
Unh!

458
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,689
Die, die!

459
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,860
There you dudes are!

460
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,962
I been tryin' to get your attention!

461
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,564
Glue. Lots of glue.

462
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:07,830
Oh, son, don't you mind that Stanford Pines.

463
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:10,567
You'll get your revenge one of these days.

464
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,936
No! It's not just about revenge!

465
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,571
I want that shack. The physical building.

466
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,739
But why?

467
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:22,611
Because it holds a secret you couldn't possibly imagine.

468
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,781
Uh, sweetie, you want some ice cream?

469
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:27,516
Did you pick out all the nuts?

470
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,516
Mm-hmm.

471
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,517
Ah!

472
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:33,886
Lil' more?

473
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,890
That's good.

474
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:41,927
Mr. Pines,

475
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,930
I'm from the winninghouse coupon savers contest

476
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:46,734
And you are our big winner!

477
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,675
I guess we'll have to give the prize to our runner-up winner...

478
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,776
Fiddleford H. McGucket?

479
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,605
How would you like ten million dollars?

480
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,576
It's my dream come true!

481
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,610
Hahaha!

482
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,581
Cross this town off our list.
