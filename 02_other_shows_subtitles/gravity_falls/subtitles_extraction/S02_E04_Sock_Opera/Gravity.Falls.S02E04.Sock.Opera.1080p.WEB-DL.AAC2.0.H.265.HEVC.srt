1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,241
All right, Mabel,
today is the big day.

2
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,275
Big day!

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,945
Soos finally
fixed up the laptop.

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,113
If this thing works,

5
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,647
we could learn the identity
of the author

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,117
and unravel the greatest
mysteries of Gravity Falls.

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,151
You ready?

8
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,020
Oh, I'm ready, baby.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,555
Ma-ma.

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,730
This is it.
This is it.

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,802
( chuckles )

12
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,606
BOTH: blip, blap,
bloobity bloop, twins.

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,608
( alarm )

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,945
Ugh!
Of course, a password.

15
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,647
Don't you worry,
bro bro.

16
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,784
With your brains
and my laser focus,

17
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,887
there is literally nothing
that can distract us from...

18
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,888
( piano music playing )

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,122
Did you hear that?

20
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,258
♪ All my life
I've been dreaming ♪

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,094

00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,567
♪ Literacy

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,570
I finally understand
what all the buzz is about.

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,871
Reading.

27
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,673
Give me some
of that honey.

28
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,175
( kissing )

29
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,215
Ba bump.
Ba bump.

30
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,616
Oh, boy.

31
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,158
( laughter and applause )

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,826
Thank you.
Thank you.

33
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,095
Just when I was getting
over Mermando,

34
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,397
of course, you show up
at my doorstep.

35
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,766
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about Mermando.

36
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,669
Did not care
for Mermandooo.

37
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,138
Okay,
this cryptology book says

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,874
there's 7.2 million
8-letter words.

39
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,842
I'll type, you read.
Okay, Mabel?

40
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,943
Mabel?

41
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,381
♪ And that's why we don't
stick our hands in... ♪

42
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,850

43
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,951
Hey, I'm Gabe Benson,
y'all.

44
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,052
Goodnight.

45
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,121
( indistinct chatter )

46
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,290
Hey, good job today,
you guys.

47
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,092
You were late
on your cue.

48
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,093
What?

49
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,761
Hey, hey.
Be good to each other.

50
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,196
We're all stars.

51
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,430
Hey!
Guess who's Mabel?

52
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,001
Care to learn more?
I bet you do.

53
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,169
You like to learn.

54
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,170
( chuckles )

55
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,172
( screams )

56
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,008
Oh, hey, I'm Gabe,
master of puppets.

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,109
Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,311
You're amazing
with those puppets.

59
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,747
A lot of people
think puppets are dumb

60
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,682
or just for kids
or something.

61
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,919
Are you kidding me?
I'm puppet crazy.

62
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,054
People call me
"puppet crazy Mabel".

63
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,423
People used to call me
"puppet crazy Gabe".

64
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,258
So when's your
next puppet show?

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,129
if you're not throwing
puppet shows, right.

66
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:21,366
Yeah, I mean I'm totally
working on a puppet show.

67
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,202
Oh,
what are the details?

68
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:27,172
There are
so many details.

69
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,276
( sighs )

70
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,047
Dipper, how hard
do you think it would be

71
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,416
to write and compose
a sock puppet rock opera

72
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,085
and live pyrotechnics
by Friday?

73
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,119
( beeping )

74
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,921
What?
Mabel, are you serious?

75
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,289
I don't know
what happened.

76
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,258
I got lost in his eyes
and his ponytail

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,060
and I'm going to be
so embarrassed on Friday

78
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,728
if I don't have
anything.

79
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,496
But what about cracking
this password?

80
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,332
You know,
mystery twins?

81
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:56,235
If you help me with this
for just a couple of days,

82
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,070
I promise I'll help you
with the password.

83
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,005
Please.
Pretty please.

84
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,908
It's for love, Dipper.

85
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,477
All right, okay.

86
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,346
Yes!
Thank you.

87
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,915
This guy,
he's number one!

88
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,983
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

89
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,419
Man, I can't wait to get to
the bottom of this laptop.

90
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,921
We're close
to something big here.

91
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,422
I can feel it.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,066
Ugh!

93
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,104
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

94
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,440
Come on.

95
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,286
All right, the play
is going to be called

96
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,122
"Glove Story-
A Sock Opera."

97
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,424
Just a warning,
people's eyes will get wet,

98
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,260
'cause they'll be crying
from laughing,

99
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,362
from how tragic it is.

100
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,997
Yeah, that...
that sounds great.

101
00:04:58,999 --> 00:04:59,998
( coughs )

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,534
you just got to roll
with Mabel's craziness.

103
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,336
It's what makes
life worth living.

104
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,570
♪ Puppet boy,

Goodnight, my babies.

109
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,452
Wack, wack, wack, muaah.

110
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,020
Soon, Gabe Benson.

111
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,188
( beeping )

112
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,323
Ugh, wrong password.

113
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,224
Wrong. Wrong! Ugh!

114
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,359
Don't stay up
all night, Dipper.

115
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,394
Last time you got
this sleep deprived

116
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,063
you tried to eat
your own shirt.

117
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,032
Bleh.

118
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,168
Just a few more tries.

119
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,269
( beeping )

120
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,106
Ugh!
I can't take that sound anymore.

121
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:45,010
I hate you sound.

122
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,412
There has to be
some shortcut or clue.

123
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,448
Who would know
about secret codes?

124
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,198
I think I know a guy.

125
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,302
Well, well, well,

126
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,371
you're awfully persistent,
Pine Tree.

127
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,572
Hats off to you.

128
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,441
( Dipper whimpering )

129
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,609
You again!

130
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,279
Did you miss me?
Admit it, you missed me.

131
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,981
Hardly.
You worked with Gideon.

132
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,450
You tried to destroy
my uncle's mind.

133
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,453
It was just a job, kid.
No hard feelings.

134
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,356
I've been keeping
an eye on you

135
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,159
since then and I must say,
I'm impressed.

136
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,160
Really?

137
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,461
You deserve a prize.

138
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,597
Here, have a head
that's always screaming.

139
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,232
( screams )

140
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,337
( Bill laughs )

141
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,105
The point is,
I like you.

142
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,174
How's about you let me
give you a hint, huh?

143
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:53,478
I only ask
for a small favor in return.

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,313
I'd never do
a favor for you.

145
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,349
Don't forget who defeated
you last time.

146
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,451
Right,
you defeated me.

147
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,686
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

148
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,923
I'll be here for you
ready to make a deal.

149
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,093
Hey, want to hear my impression
of you in about 3 seconds.

150
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,428
( screaming )

151
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,237
Hey,
I'm puppet Stan.

152
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,472
Still ignoring this.

153
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,407
Hey, Mabel.

154
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,475
( yawns )

155
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,510
Whoa, bag check
for Dipper's eyes.

156
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,345
Nobody?

157
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,948
Dipper, I told you to get
some sleep last night.

158
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,083
Here, wake up
with some Mabel juice.

159
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,719
It has plastic
dinosaurs in it.

160
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,389
It's like if coffee
and nightmares had a baby.

161
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,492
Last night I had
a dream with Bill in it.

162
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,727
Wait, hold up.
The triangle guy?

163
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,996
He said he'd give me
the code of the laptop

164
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,531
if I gave him
something.

165
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,500
Like I'd actually
trust Bill, right?

166
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,401
Don't worry, bro.

167
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,370
that the mystery twins
are back in action.

168
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,538
I'll help you
crack that code.

169
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,273
I just got to hand
off my puppet stuff

170
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,408
to my production crew.

171
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,609
Production crew?

172
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,480
We read the script.
Very emotional.

173
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,548
I cried, like,
eight times.

174
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,616
GABE: Hey, ladies.

175
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,253
Gabe!

176
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,490
Helps me dry out my ponytail
after a shower.

177
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,692
Aah. Aah.

178
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,427
Hoppity boppity.

179
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,461
( speaking
in foreign language )

180
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,601
I was just working on the
world's greatest puppet show.

181
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,069
It has puppets.

182
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,071
Your passion
is so refreshing, Mabel,

183
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,440
unlike the girl from
last night's puppet show.

184
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,476
Single-stitch on one puppet
and cross-stitch on the other?

185
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,012
I was like, uh-huh.

186
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,413
Cross... huh?

187
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,316
Naturally I deleted her off
my cell phone contacts list.

188
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,551
Naturally.

189
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,553
( nervous giggle )

190
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,154
I know you won't
let me down though.

191
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,456
Based on what you
said the other day,

192
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,157
you must be
a puppet expert.

193
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,093
You know, Gabe,
you look pretty sweaty.

194
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,661
You should really
take your shirt off.

195
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,729
Right?

196
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,163
Aren't we all
thinking that?

197
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,798
Later, ladies.

198
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,235
Bah!

199
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,404
We got to up
our game, girls.

200
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,407
Did you hear that thing
he said about the stitches?

201
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,377
Don't worry, Mabel,
your crew can handle it.

202
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,645
( grunts )

203
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,748
How many eyes does
a face have again?

204
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,251
I got it. I got it. Oh!

205
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,553
( alarm wailing )

206
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,054
I'm not okay.

207
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,057
Ah!
Okay, I'm back on fabrication.

208
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,392
Get me my lint roller.

209
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:26,631
Dipper, this sock crisis just
bumped up to a code argyle.

210
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,533
The laptop can wait.

211
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,668
Mabel,
do you seriously think

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,169
that your random
crush of the week

213
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,437
is more important
than uncovering

214
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,572
the mysteries
of this town?

215
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,739
You're obsessed.

216
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,807
I'm obsessed?

217
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,410
Look at you.
You look like a vampire.

218
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,379
But you said you were
gonna help me today.

219
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,549
Well, I can help
you with tickles.

220
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,284
( laughter )

221
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,387
Okay, fine.
You know what?

222
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,289
I'll do it on my own.

223
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,826
Passwords, passwords.

224
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,096
Mabel is useless.

225
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,164
( yawns )

226
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,432
Oh, man.

227
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,634
<i>COMPUTER: Too many</i>
<i>failed entries.</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

228
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,437
<i>Initiate data erase</i>
<i>in 5 minutes.</i>

229
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,438
( beeping )

230
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,709
I'm gonna lose everything?
I only have one more try?

231
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,813
Well, well, well.

232
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,548
Someone's looking
desperate.

233
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,516
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

234
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,684
I can help you, kid.

235
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,486
You just need to hear
out my demands.

236
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,355
Ugh!

237
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,723
What crazy thing do
you want, anyway?

238
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,891
To eat my soul?
To rip out my teeth?

239
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,395
Are you gonna replace my eyes
with baby heads or something?

240
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,498
Yeesh, kid, relax.
All I want is a puppet.

241
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,267
A puppet?
What are you playing at?

242
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,702
Everyone loves puppets.

243
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,671
And it looks to me like
you've got a surplus.

244
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,640
I don't know, man.

245
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,908
Mabel worked
really hard on these.

246
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,544
Seems to me one little puppet
is a small price to pay

247
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,680
to learn all the secrets
of the universe.

248
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,883
Besides, what's your sister
done for you lately?

249
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,719
How many times have you
sacrificed for her, huh?

250
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,422
And when has she ever
returned the favor?

251
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,359
( beeping )

252
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,229
Tick tock, kid.

253
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,499
Just one puppet?
Fine.

254
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,903
So what puppet are
you gonna pick anyway?

255
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:16,174
Hmm, let's see.
Eenie meenie mynee...

256
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,175
You.

257
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,777
What?

258
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,180
What?
This can't be happening.

259
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,782
What did you
do to my body?

260
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,654
Sorry, kid, but
you're my puppet now.

261
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,523
( evil laughter )

262
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,759
Oh, my gosh.
This can't be happening.

263
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,294
This can't be happening.

264
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,462
Wh-whoa.

265
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,663
( laughing )

266
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,635
Man, it's been so long
since I've inhabited a body.

267
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:44,803
Ooh! Ooh!

268
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,870
( chuckles )

269
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,639
Pain is hilarious.

270
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,409
And two eyes?
This thing's deluxe.

271
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,713
Why are you doing this?
I thought we had a deal.

272
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,549
Look, kid, you've been getting
way too close to figuring out

273
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,783
some major answers.

274
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,485
I've got big plans coming

275
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,886
and I don't need you
getting in my way.

276
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,788
Destroying that laptop
was a cinch.

277
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,990
Now I just need to
destroy your journal.

278
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,592
Race you to the bottom
of the stairs.

279
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,703
Hey.
Human soda.

280
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,638
I'm gonna drink
it like a person.

281
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,443
So where do you keep
that journal anyway?

282
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,812
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

283
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,481
Boy, these arms are durable.

284
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,650
you'll never find it
in a million years.

285
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,320
I borrowed your journal
to use as a prop in the show.

286
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,522
I'm gonna go before you
process this sentence.

287
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,890
Okay, bye!

288
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,528
Sure, sounds great, sister.
I'll see you at the show.

289
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,029
Wait.
No, Mabel, don't listen to him.

290
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,297
That's not me.

291
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,333
You've got to hear me.

292
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,601
No, no. Wait. Stop!

293
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,705
Ha, welcome
to the mindscape, kid.

294
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,274
Without a vessel to possess,
you're basically a ghost.

295
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,642
Oh, hi, Dipper.
There you are.

296
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,877
What up, dude?

297
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,978
Soos. Wendy.
Help me.

298
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,947
We're headed
to the theater.
Need a ride, Dipper?

299
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,049
( chuckles )
BILL: Anything for you, Red.

300
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,551
I'm gonna stop you, Bill.

301
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,620
I'm gonna find that
journal before you do

302
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,054
and I'm gonna stop you!

303
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:15,293
But how can you stop
me if you don't exist?

304
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,861
( evil laughter )

305
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,036
Bill?
Bill!

306
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,772
Got to get my body back before
he does something crazy with it.

307
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,478
Ah, nothing like
the theater, huh, toots?

308
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,779
Hey, Soos, want to hear

309
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,314
the exact time and date
of your death?

310
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,315
( chuckles )

311
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,416
Okay.

312
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,918
Hey, guys,
you all made it.

313
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,888
I would never miss
whatever this is.

314
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,558
By the by, Mabel, where'd
you put my journal again?

315
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,827
I used it as a prop
for the big wedding scene.

316
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,562
I still need
a reverend though.

317
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,463
Hey, what if I play
the reverend?

318
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,632
I mean, someone's got to
hold that journal, right?

319
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,934
Great. Let's go.

320
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,769
Oh, no, wait.
Mabel!

321
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,347
GRENDA:
The show is about to begin.

322
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,982
Please turn off
your cell phones,

323
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,451
unless
you're texting me, cuties.

324
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,558
Gather around
and let us sing

325
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,529
about a girl who had
almost everything.

326
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,565
Look, it's Mabel.

327
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,633
Hey there.

328
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,834
Did you say stable?

329
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,469
No, he said Mabel.

330
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,471
Okay, hit it, boys!

331
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,008
♪ Who's that girl
with the pig and the braces? ♪

332
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,612
♪ She put smiles
on everyone's faces ♪

333
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,882
♪ When she's around,
no, you're never bored ♪

334
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,483
♪ I'm a mayor

335
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,552
♪ I'm here for an award

336
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,120

00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,389
♪ It's true, I'm great

339
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,629
Hey, what's up?
I'm Gabe.

340
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,233
So, hey, Grendo,

341
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,535
where's that book prop I'm
using for the wedding scene?

342
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,970
It's up in the wedding cake.

343
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,772
But that doesn't come
down until Act 3.

344
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,641
So hold your horses.

345
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,578
Oh, I'll hold my horses.
I'll hold them.

346
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,879
You monster.

347
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,916
Hey, listen.
Have you seen Mabel?

348
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,584
Hmm.

349
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,752
What did Bill say?

350
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,787
I can't be heard
without a vessel?

351
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,489
Where would I find a...

352
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,960
Finally we're together.

353
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:33,631
I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have
to go fight in the war.

354
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,199
( screaming )

355
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,070
( growling )

356
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,571
( gunshots )

357
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,041
I'll wait for you, Gabe.

358
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,542
I'll wait for you.

359
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,612
GRENDA: Our intermission
has begun.

360
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,713
Mill about.

361
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,048
( crowd murmurs )

362
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,784
Ooh!
Okay, you can do this, Mabel.

363
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,119
Only 36 more musical numbers.

364
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,991
Psst.
Mabel.

365
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,496
The puppet books
didn't warn me about this.

366
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:09,534
Mabel, it's me, Dipper.
You need to help me.

367
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,602
Wait, what?
Dipper?

368
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,506
But you're so much more
of a sock than usual.

369
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,241
Mabel, you have to listen.
Bill tricked me.

370
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,711
He stole my body and now
he's after the journal.

371
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,013
You have to find the journal
before Bill destroys it.

372
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,482
It's the only hope
to get me back in my body.

373
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,250
But my cue's
coming up any minute.

374
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,653
Hey, Mabel,
do you have a moment?

375
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,654
Gabe!

376
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,655
( giggles )

377
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,690
Ow!
Mabel.

378
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,526
Mabel, it's clear to me now
that you really love puppets.

379
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,961
I mean you went whole hog.

380
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,863
And if you stick
the ending, well,

381
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,999
maybe later you could
join me for a biscotti?

382
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,033
( gasps )

383
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,836
You drive a biscotti?

384
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,104
I'll be waiting.

385
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,607
Did you hear that?
He loves it!

386
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,509
This play
has to be flawless.

387
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,277
Can't we wait
until after the show?

388
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,280
Mabel, you want me to be
a sock puppet forever?

389
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,281
( laughing )

390
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,282
I'm sorry.

391
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,585
It looks funny
when you're mad.

392
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,819
( grunting )

393
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,225
Just take over for me until
I get back with the book.

394
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,594
Little puppet face.

395
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:12,530
Gabe, you're back
from the war.

396
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,600
Want to kiss and sing
at the same time?

397
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,968
Okay.

398
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,838
Seriously?

399
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,849
Come on.
Come on.

400
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,922
I hope this kiss never ends.

401
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,123
( exhaling )

402
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,326
There must be a way to
get Dipper's body back.

403
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:45,163
Oh-oh, but why would
you want to do that?

404
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,865
( gaps )

405
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,301
Bill-Dipper!
Bipper.

406
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,569
Shh.

407
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,704
You wouldn't
want to ruin the show.

408
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,872
Whoops.

409
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:55,907
( screaming )

410
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,075
It's slipping.

411
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,776
How's about you
hand that book over?

412
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,244
No way.
This is Dipper's.

413
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,345
I'd never give it away.

414
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,380
Hmm.

415
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,781
You didn't seem
to have a problem

416
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,083
taking it for your own play.

417
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,684
Or ditching him
when he needed you.

418
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,619
So come to your senses.

419
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,254
Give me the book
or your play is ruined.

420
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,123
( sighs )

421
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,858
There it is.

422
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,626
I mean, who would
sacrifice everything

423
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,762
they've worked for just
for their dumb sibling?

424
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,997
Dipper would.

425
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:20,998
Eh?

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,266
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

427
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,668
I'm giving you away.

428
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,603
You are a woman now.

429
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,772
Waddles, the rings.

430
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,873
Wait, what?

431
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,175
Oh, no.

432
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,881
Get out of my brother's body,
you evil triangle!

433
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,883
Whoa!
Children fighting.

434
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,218
I can sell this.

435
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,654
Aah!
You can't stop me.

436
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,657
I am a being of pure energy
with no weakness.

437
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,328
True, but you're
in Dipper's body.

438
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,797
And I know
all his weaknesses.

439
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,965
What do you mean
"his--?"

440
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:54,966
Tickle, tickle.

441
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,934
( laughing )

442
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,036
Aah!
Body spasms.

443
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,204
What are these?

444
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,939
A little note
about the human body.

445
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,475
You haven't slept
in over 24 hours.

446
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,943
Also,
I got a full night's sleep

447
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,112
and I'm on four
mega shots of Mabel juice.

448
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,180
( panting )

449
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,948
What is this feeling?

450
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,251
My body is burning.

451
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,753
I can't move
these stupid noodle legs.

452
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,055
Curse you,
useless flesh sticks.

453
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,391
Body shutting down,

454
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,360
must scratch,

455
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,028
mosquito bites.

456
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,669
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

457
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,673
What?

458
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,674
Yes!

459
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,109
I'm in my own body

460
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,779
and it's just as
underwhelming as I remember.

461
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,847
( groans )

462
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,881
Everything hurts.

463
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,349
( evil laughter )

464
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,388
This isn't the last
you'll hear of me.

465
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,889
Big things are coming.

466
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,357
You can't stop me.

467
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,992
I'm sorry, Gabe.

468
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,971
( opera music playing )

469
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,090
Don't worry.

470
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,426
I've seen enough movies
to know this is the part

471
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,196
it was all part of the show
and loves it.

472
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,031
Cue applause!

473
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,200
( crowd booing )

474
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,207
Gabe!

475
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,142
Stick around
for the wrap party?

476
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,144
We got mini quiches.

477
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,080
Don't speak to me, Mabel.

478
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,349
You've made a mockery
of my art form.

479
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,817
Let's go, my loves.

480
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,253
( kissing )

481
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,488
Did he just make out
with his puppets?

482
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,191
I might have dodged
a bullet there.

483
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,392
( speaking in
foreign language )

484
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,161
Oof!

485
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,097
Mabel,
I'm sorry about all this.

486
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,032
It's my fault
your puppets got ruined.

487
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,800
Well,
one of them survived.

488
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,769
And she has something
to say to you.

489
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,871
I'm sorry, Dipper.

490
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,275
I spent all week
obsessing over a dumb guy.

491
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,978
But the dumb guy I should
have cared about was you.

492
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,979
Bah!

493
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,814
Mystery twins.

494
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,283
Mystery twins.

495
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,784
Ow!

496
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,452
What did
Bill do to my hand?

497
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,487
Aah!

498
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,322
Nothing
a little sleep can't fix.

499
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,458
Come on, bro bro,
let's go home.

500
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,260
Seriously, I need to
go to the hospital.

501
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,928
Hey, Dipper.

502
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,299
What did one sock puppet say
to the other sock puppet?

503
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,333
I don't know, Mabel.

504
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,401
What?

505
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,270
You look like
you could use a hand.

506
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,505
( laughing )

507
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,310
That joke
was really something.

508
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,512
Yeah, something terrible.

509
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,180
( laughing )

510
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,516
( screaming )
