00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,538
MOVE ASIDE.

159
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,449
JACKPOT!

160
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,217
A SECRET PASSAGEWAY.

161
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,618
WE'LL HAVE TO BE
STEALTHY.

162
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,587
I'LL HAMBONE A MESSAGE
IF THERE'S TROUBLE.

163
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,459
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

164
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,466
( voices chanting )

165
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,001
( chanting continues )

166
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,475
WHO IS THE SUBJECT
OF OUR MEETING?

167
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,076
( gasping )

168
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,644
THIS WOMAN.

169
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,049
LAZY SUSAN?

170
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,318
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU HAVE SEEN?

171
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,686
All: SPEAK!

172
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,122
UH, WELL, UH,
I WAS LEAVING THE DINER,

173
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,559
AND I SAW THESE LITTLE
BEARDED DOODADS,

174
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,128
AND I WAS, LIKE,
"WHAAAA?"

175
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,730
THERE, THERE.

176
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,299
YOU WON'T BE
"LIKE WHAAAA"

177
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,001
FOR MUCH LONGER.

178
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,436
WHAT IS THAT GIZMO?

179
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,338
IT LOOKS LIKE
A HAIR DRYER.

180
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,173
ARE YOU GUYS BARBERS?

181
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,476
( screaming )

182
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,448
LAZY SUSAN, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW OF LITTLE BEARDED MEN?

183
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,649
MY MIND IS CLEAR,

184
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,618
THANKS TO THE SOCIETY
OF THE BLIND EYE.

185
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,454
All: IT IS UNSEEN.

186
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,089
OH, MY GOSH.

187
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,358
THEY ERASED
LAZY SUSAN'S MEMORY.

188
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,367
GUYS, ARE YOU
SEEING THIS?

189
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,269
THEY JUST WIPED
LAZY SUSAN'S MEMORY.

190
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,171
THEY SHOULD'VE WIPED OFF
THAT AWFUL MASCARA.

191
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,473
I THINK SHE
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

192
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,542
SHE'S DOING THE BEST
SHE CAN, SOOS.

193
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,643
WHOA, TOUCHED
A NERVE THERE.

194
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:08,346
LAZY SUSAN,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

195
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,248
I FEEL GREAT!

196
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,550
I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHAT WAS WRONG,

197
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,418
OR WHAT I'M DOING HERE,

198
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,320
OR IF I'M
A MAN OR A WOMAN.

199
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,389
YOUR MEMORIES
WILL BE SAFE WITH US,

200
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,391
BURIED IN THE HALL
OF THE FORGOTTEN.

201
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,692
Robed Men: INTO THE HALL
OF THE FORGOTTEN.

202
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,694
INTO THE HALL
OF THE FORGOTTEN.

203
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,197
GOOD CHANTING, BOYS.
HAVE YOU BEEN PRACTICING?

204
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,066
( all gasping )

205
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,834
MEETING ADJOURNED.

206
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,536
- UNSEE YOU LATER.
- UNSEE YOU LATER.

207
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,537
UNSEE YOU LATER.

208
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,539
UNSEE YOU LATER.

209
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,643
AMAZING.

210
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:42,180
A SECRET SOCIETY
OF EVIL MIND ERASERS.

211
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,183
I'LL BET THEY ERASED
YOUR MEMORY A LONG TIME AGO.

212
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,352
IF WE COULD FIND
WHERE YOUR MEMORIES
HAVE BEEN HIDDEN,

213
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,087
IT COULD BE THE KEY
TO UNLOCKING

214
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,156
ALL THE MYSTERIES
OF GRAVITY FALLS.

215
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,358
ALL RIGHT,
MABEL, WENDY,
YOU TWO STAY HERE

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,193
AND MAKE SURE THOSE
ROBE GUYS DON'T COME BACK.

217
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,428
WHOOO! GIRLS CLUB.

218
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,796
SOOS, YOU, ME,
AND McGUCKET

219
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,798
ARE GONNA GO FIND
THE HALL OF THE FORGOTTEN.

220
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,366
- ( sucking sound )
- WHOA!

221
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,867
FOLLOW THAT HAT!

222
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,407
Robed Man: HALT!
IS SOMEONE THERE?

223
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,377
AAH! WHAT DO WE DO?
WHERE DO WE GO?

224
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,491
MAN, THESE ARE
REALLY POORLY MADE.

225
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,159
I COULD'VE SWORN
I HEARD SOMEONE.

226
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,394
PROBABLY JUST
THE JANITOR

227
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,396
KISSING THAT WAX
SETTLER WOMAN AGAIN.

228
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,165
WOOF! REMIND ME TO
ERASE THAT FROM MY MEMORY.

229
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,534
WHEW! THERE IT IS.

230
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,570
HURRY!

231
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,789
HONEY FOGELIN',
SALT LICKIN' SKULLDUGGERY.

232
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,326
MAN, YOU HAVE GOT TO
TEACH ME SOME OF THOSE
OLD-MAN SWEAR WORDS.

233
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,294
( sighs )

234
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,729
I JUST DON'T
GET IT, WENDY.

235
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,499
I HUG A LOT, I CAN
BURP THE ALPHABET,

236
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,434
I HAVE SCRATCH
AND SNIFF CLOTHING.

237
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,635
WHY DOES EVERY BOY
LEAVE ME?

238
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,238
PFFT, WHO CARES?
BOYS ARE THE WORST.

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,439
YOU SHOULDN'T GET
HUNG UP, MAN.

240
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,741
MAYBE I COME ON
TOO STRONG, YOU KNOW?

241
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,443
WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR OPENER?

242
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,644
PRETEND I'M A BOY.

243
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,480
MMM, TESTOSTERONE.
( spits )

244
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,216
( loudly ) HI. I'M MABEL!
I'M 12 AND OWN A PIG!

245
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,851
WANNA GET MARRIED?!

246
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,422
( laughs )
HONESTLY? THAT WAS PERFECT.

247
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,457
YOU SHOULD JUST
FORGET ABOUT GUYS, MAN.

248
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,561
WENDY, THAT'S IT.
FORGET ABOUT GUYS.

249
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,297
I JUST NEED TO TYPE
"SUMMER ROMANCES"
INTO THIS THING,

250
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,800
AND I WON'T FEEL
BAD ABOUT THEM ANYMORE.

251
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,703
WHOA, HOLD UP, MABEL.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT THING DOES.

252
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,371
YOU COULD ACCIDENTALLY
ERASE, LIKE,

253
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,606
LEARNING TO READ
OR BREATHE OR...

254
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,575
OR ONE OF THOSE
TERRIBLE SUMMER SONGS

255
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,411
YOU CAN'T GET
OUT OF YOUR HEAD?

256
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,413
LOOK AT ALL THESE TUBES.

257
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,816
PEOPLE MUST'VE BEEN
GETTING THEIR MEMORIES
ERASED ALL OVER TOWN.

258
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,553
WHOA, LOOK AT THIS.

259
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,926
YES, ROBBIE, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU HAVE SEEN?

260
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,328
<i>SO I WAS ATTACKED BY</i>
<i>THIS MAGIC KUNG FU GUY</i>

261
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,697
<i>THAT WAS THROWING, LIKE,</i>
<i>BALLS OF FIRE AT ME.</i>

262
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,432
<i>I KICKED HIS BUTT,</i>
<i>THOUGH.</i>

263
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,934
ROBBIE,
SPEAK HONESTLY.

264
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,469
<i>I WAS SAVED BY</i>
<i>A 12-YEAR-OLD.</i>

265
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,870
WHY ARE THEY ERASING
PEOPLE'S MEMORIES?

266
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,371
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

267
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,240
LOOKY, FELLERS.

268
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,775
IT'S THOSE WORDS
WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME.

269
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,611
OH, DUDE, YOUR MEMORIES.
WE DID IT.

270
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,346
GRABBY GRABBY.

271
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,315
( beeping )

272
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,317
I GOT IT!

273
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,390
I DON'T KNOW, MABEL.
ARE YOU REALLY SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

274
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,326
ALL IDEAS ARE GOOD IDEAS.

275
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,595
- ( loud beeping )
- DO YOU HEAR THAT?

276
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,466
THE ALARM IN MY BRAIN
IS A-RINGIN' AGAIN. AH!

277
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,469
HALT! WHO'S THERE?

278
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,671
- OH, NO!
- RUN.

279
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,507
GET BACK HERE!

280
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,543
OH, YOU'VE REALLY
TARRED IT UP NOW, FIDDLEFORD.

281
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,512
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

282
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,047
WHY DOES MY BEARD
HAVE A BANDAGE?

283
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,516
DOES THAT EVEN MAKE SENSE?

284
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,984
WHY HAS NO ONE
POINTED THAT OUT?

285
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,756
OKAY, I THINK
WE'RE SAFE.

286
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,725
WE PLAYING
"GUESS WHO"?

287
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,560
DUDE, I KNOW
IT'S YOU, DIPPER.

288
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,495
SUCH BIG, STRONG HANDS.

289
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,702
( chanting )

290
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,071
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

291
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,741
WE DO NOT GIVE UP
OUR SECRETS LIGHTLY.

292
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,709
WHO ARE YOU
BATHROBE-WEARING FREAKS?

293
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,678
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,513
WHAT'S WITH YOUR CREEPY
BRITISH ACCENT?

295
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:40,051
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE ARE GOING
TO ERASE YOUR MINDS ANYWAY.

296
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,953
Mabel:
TOBY DETERMINED?

297
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,521
Dipper:
BUD GLEEFUL?

298
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,089
Wendy:
THAT FARMER GUY?

299
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,325
CREEPY DUDE WHO
MARRIED A WOODPECKER?

300
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,027
YOU, TOO?
HOW'S THAT MARRIAGE
GOIN', BY THE WAY?

301
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,029
OH, GREAT, GREAT.

302
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,964
( whispering )
NOT GREAT.

303
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,400
AND YOU'VE NEVER
MET ME BEFORE.

304
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,336
AND IF YOU HAD,
YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER.

305
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,904
I AM BLIND IVAN,

306
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:04,709
AND WE ARE THE SOCIETY

307
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,478
FORMED MANY YEARS AGO
BY OUR FOUNDER...

308
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,515
OUR FOUNDER... DOES
ANYONE REMEMBER WHO HE WAS?

309
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,352
WE'VE BEEN USIN'
THAT RAY ON OUR OWN
BRAINS AN AWFUL LOT.

310
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,921
WHY WOULD YOU DO ALL THIS?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO GAIN?

311
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,857
AS YOU HAVE
NO DOUBT DISCOVERED,

312
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,658
<i>GRAVITY FALLS</i>

313
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,794
<i>WITH SUPERNATURAL</i>
<i>STRANGENESS.</i>

314
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,763
<i>NO ONE KNEW HOW TO STOP</i>
<i>THE THINGS THAT WENT</i>
<i>BUMP IN THE NIGHT,</i>

315
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,467
SO OUR FOUNDER INVENTED
THE NEXT BEST THING--

316
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,469
<i>A WAY FOR US</i>
<i>TO FORGET.</i>

317
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,137
<i>WE TOOK IT</i>
<i>UPON OURSELVES</i>

318
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,106
<i>TO HELP THE TROUBLED</i>
<i>TOWNSFOLK</i>

319
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,443
BY ERASING THE MEMORIES OF THE
<i>STRANGE THINGS THEY'VE SEEN.</i>

320
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,478
<i>NOW THE PEOPLE OF</i>
<i>GRAVITY FALLS</i>

321
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,714
<i>GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES</i>
<i>IGNORANT AND HAPPY,</i>

00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,515
<i>THANKS TO US.</i>

323
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,117

WE HELP OURSELVES

324
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,119
FORGET THINGS THAT
TROUBLE US.

325
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,521
EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING
THEY'D RATHER FORGET.

326
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,123
IN FACT, YOUR OWN SISTER

327
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,559
WAS ABOUT TO USE
THAT RAY ON HERSELF.

328
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,526
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

329
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,528
MABEL? SERIOUSLY?

330
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,931
HA-HA. MAYBE.

331
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,566
DON'T YOU SEE?
THIS IS RUINING LIVES.

332
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,568
WHAT ABOUT
OLD MAN McGUCKET?

333
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,470
HE LIVES IN A HUT
AND TALKS TO ANIMALS,

334
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,604
THANKS TO YOU.

335
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,705
DON'T YOU FEEL
BAD ABOUT THAT?

336
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,841
MMM, MAYBE A LITTLE.

337
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,844
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

338
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,680
YOU WON'T BE TELLING ANYONE
ELSE WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED HERE.

339
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,750
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR SUMMER.

340
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,952
GUYS, IF WE'RE GONNA
FORGET EVERYTHING,

341
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,054
I GOT SOME STUFF I WANNA
GET OFF MY CHEST.

342
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,523
MABEL, FOR HALF THE SUMMER,
I THOUGHT YOUR NAME WAS MAPLE,

343
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,759
LIKE THE SYRUP.
NO ONE CORRECTED ME.

344
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,161
I ONLY LOVE
SOME OF MY STUFFED ANIMALS,

345
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,563
AND THE GUILT
IS KILLING ME!

346
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,667
SOMETIMES I USE BIG WORDS
AND I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT THEY MEAN.

347
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,735
I MEAN, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE THE SMART GUY.

348
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,537
IF I'M NOT THE SMART GUY,
WHO AM I?

349
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,172
OKAY, I'M NOT
ACTUALLY LAID BACK.

350
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,007
I'M STRESSED,
LIKE, 24/7.

351
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,542
HAVE YOU MET MY FAMILY?

352
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,811
( all talking at once )

353
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,982
OH, STOP BEING
A BUNCH OF BABIES.

354
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,618
- OWIE!
- ( all gasping )

355
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,787
All: McGUCKET?!

356
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,222
I RAIDED THE MINING
DISPLAY FOR WEAPONS.

357
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,525
NOW FIGHT LIKE
A HILLBILLY, FELLERS.

358
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,963
NOBODY BETTER MESS.

359
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,466
THEY KNOW TOO MUCH.
DON'T LET THEM ESCAPE!

360
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,969
GET THIS SONG
OUTTA YOUR HEAD.

361
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,738
DYSENTERY'S GONNA
GET YOU, DAWG.

362
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,507
I GOTTA GET
THE MEMORY TUBE.

363
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,475
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

364
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,110
( shrieks )

365
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,678
MABEL, CATCH.

366
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,249
I'LL TAKE THAT,
THANK YOU.

367
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,951
GIVE IT UP, BOY.

368
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,686
YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR
THE UNSTOPPABLE POWER OF...

369
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,157
THAT'S RIGHT, I DON'T WEAR
NOTHIN' UNDER MY ROBE.

370
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,159
NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT.

371
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,562
MAYBE Y'ALL SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR BEIN' A BUNCH OF PRUDES.

372
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,696
All: EWW!!

373
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,865
TIME TO ERASE
THAT FOREVER.

374
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,234
- GIVE ME THAT TUBE.
- NEVER!

375
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,107
THAT MEMORY BELONGS
TO McGUCKET.

376
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,509
THE SOCIETY'S SECRETS
BELONG TO US.

377
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,683
END OF THE LINE.

378
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,319
BY TOMORROW, THIS WILL
ALL SEEM LIKE A BAD DREAM.

379
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,289
SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR PRECIOUS MEMORIES.

380
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,527
NO!!

381
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,198
McGUCKET, YOU TOOK
A BULLET FOR ME.

382
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,701
OH, MY GOSH!
ARE YOU OKAY?

383
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,569
OKAY AS I'LL EVER BE.
( laughs )

384
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,771
WHAT?

385
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:24,242
WHY... ISN'T...
THIS... WORKING?

386
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,844
HIT ME WITH
YOUR BEST SHOT, BALDY.

387
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,547
MY MIND'S BEEN GONE
FOR 30-ODD YEARS.

388
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,283
YOU CAN'T BREAK
WHAT'S ALREADY BROKEN.

389
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,989
SAY GOOD NIGHT,
SALLY.

390
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,165
UNHAND US!

391
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,667
IT ISN'T SO FUN
BEING TIED UP, IS IT?

392
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,836
- HEY, WANNA DRAW
ON THEIR FACES?
- WHAT?

393
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,572
- TRA-LA-LA...
- HEY, STOP THAT!

394
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,841
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

395
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,309
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

396
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,011

OBJECTIVELY FUNNY.

WE'LL HAVE OUR REVENGE.

398
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,649
WE'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

399
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,584
OH, I THINK
YOU JUST MIGHT.

400
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,985

STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

463
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,306
SO, WAIT, YOU WEREN'T
THE AUTHOR, BUT YOU
WORKED WITH HIM.

464
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,841
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHO HE WAS?

465
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,343
IT'S BEGINNING
TO COME BACK,

466
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,178
BUT I NEED MORE TIME.

467
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,314
AND READING GLASSES.
HECK!

468
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,516
( spits ) I GOT SOME
REMEMBERIN' TO DO.

469
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,785
SO, MABEL,
YOU STILL WANNA ERASE

470
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,455
THOSE FAILED
SUMMER ROMANCES?

471
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,263
YOU KNOW, NO ONE LIKES
HAVING BAD MEMORIES,

472
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,798
BUT MAYBE IT'S BETTER
TO REMEMBER THE BAD THINGS

473
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,267
AND LEARN FROM THEM

474
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,136
THAN TO GO ALL
DENIAL CRAZY TRYING TO FORGET.

475
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,338
THAT'S SOME MATURE
JUNK RIGHT THERE, MABEL.

476
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,407
YEP. MISS MATURE.
THAT'S ME.

477
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,276
HEY, YOU WANNA HELP ME
VANDALIZE THIS PICTURE

478
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,377
OF MY JERKY EX-CRUSH?

479
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,078
OOH, YEAH!

480
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,180
WAIT, LET'S GIVE HIM
BUCK TEETH.

481
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,553
GOING ON THIS BIG ADVENTURE
ACTUALLY MADE ME GET

482
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,290
- THAT STUPID SONG
OUT OF MY HEAD.
- Soos: NICE.

483
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,092
<i>♪ AM I BLANCHIN', GIRL,</i>
<i>WE BLANCHIN' ♪</i>

484
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,260
OH, COME ON!

485
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,796
IT'S ALL SO FAMILIAR.

486
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,499
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I CAN REMEMBER.

487
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,202
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER.

488
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,874
EVERY DAY,
IT'S GETTING STRONGER.

489
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,211
HA! YES! AH!

490
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,381
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S DANGEROUS.

491
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,916
I DON'T CARE
HOW LONG IT TAKES.

492
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,351
I'M GONNA PULL THIS OFF,

493
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,087
AND NO ONE'S GONNA
GET IN MY WAY.
