1
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,500
Gravity Falls  S01E16  Carpet Diem

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,140
Oh! Total domination!

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,170
I am the master of attic-stuff mini-golf!

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,510
From the mighty Swiss Alps

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,250
to the badlands of Dipper's old laundry,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,250
where man fears to tread.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,120
All right, let a pro on the field.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,420
Er...floor. Whatever.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,460
Ow! My head!

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,460
It hit me right in the head!

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,230
Yes! Stan shot!

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,300
Is that legal?

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,600
The judges say it's out of bounds.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,130
You're out of bounds!

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,200
Hey! Stop it!

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,210
Hey, Dipper, I gotta go hang out with Candy and Grenda tonight.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,310
Aw, again? You can't leave mid-game!

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Don't be silly, I'm not leaving!

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,510
My friends are coming to me!

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,550
Wait, what?

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,280
Oh, no. No, no, no.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,450
Sleeping bags? Rom-coms?

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,490
Calling all boys preteen edition?!

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,420
You're not having a--

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,320
Sleep over!

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,660
Okay, so how much do you like boys?

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,400
So much!

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,530
Boys make me think about kissing.

29
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,630
Candy!

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,670
Oh my gosh! Ow!

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,500
We are so crazy tonight!

32
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,450
Who wants to smear make-up on my face?

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,220
Oh, you're already so beautiful Grenda,

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,350
What would be the point?

35
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,450
Beautiful! Beautiful!

36
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,490
Beautiful!

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
Mabel!

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,360
Do you think you could do this somewhere else?

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,530
You're laughing at frequencies only dogs should hear.

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,630
Come on, it's not that bad.

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,160
You know what your brother needs?

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
A makeover?

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,210
Hey Soos, can I sleep in your break room tonight?

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
Of course, dude.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,590
You just gotta make your body

46
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,250
go like a video game puzzle block.

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,220
The trick is to hold perfectly still.

48
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,320
Oh! Wait, wait.

49
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,490
Oh! Wait, wait.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,590
Oh! Wait, wait. Ow, ow, ow--

51
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,590
I think I'll sleep somewhere else.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,230
Actually felt good that time.

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,230
Ow! Wait, wait.

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,360
Sleeping under the stars... not bad.

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,400
Ah! Get off!

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,470
Ah! Ah! Get away!

57
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,610
This is still better.

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,330
Uhh... what happened last night?

59
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,520
What's up, party girl?

60
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,160
I don't know what I was kissing in there,

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,520
But I have no regrets.

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,190
Candy falls down now!

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,430
That was awesome, girls!

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,200
See you again soon!

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,530
Hey brother!

66
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,570
You want any of this leftover pizza?

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
It's got glitter on it!

68
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,610
Mabel, last night an owl tried to eat my tongue.

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,410
That's great!

70
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
No, it's not great!

71
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,410
This is impossible to live with!

72
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,180
What? I'm delightful to live with!

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,620
Get ready to be poked by the fun stick!

74
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,320
- Boop. 
- Ahh!

75
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,290
Mabel, I've had it with the fun stick!

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,190
You've totally wrecked our room.

77
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,360
And... oh no!

78
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,490
Our mini golf course!

79
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,660
Yeah, Grenda sure loves breaking things.

80
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,600
Mabel, we need to lay down some ground rules

81
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,470
if we're gonna be living in this room together.

82
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
First of all, no sleepovers.

83
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,500
What?!

84
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
Well if I can't have sleepovers,

85
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,140
then you can't keep me up every night with your summer reading.

86
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,210
How does reading keep you up?

87
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,220
Interesting...

88
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,590
But who stole the capers?

89
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,160
Well, at least my braces don't whistle when I breathe!

90
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,360
At least I wash my clothes once in a while!

91
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,230
Washing clothes is a waste of time!

92
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,230
I'm a busy guy!

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,270
All right. If you meow one more time--

94
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,370
Okay, that's it, that's the final straw.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,340
Maybe we shouldn't share a room anymore.

96
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, uh--

97
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,170
Well, maybe we shouldn't!

98
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,340
- Fine by me! 
- Double fine by me!

99
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,610
Then we need to talk to grunkle Stan about moving rooms.

100
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,510
Yeah, he's a reasonable guy.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Fight! Fight! Fight!

102
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,650
Fight! Fight! Fight!

103
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,290
Fight! Fight! Fight!

104
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,360
Fight! Fight! Fight!

105
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,300
TV, it knows what I want.

106
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,500
Grunkle Stan? We want different rooms.

107
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,200
And I want a pair of magic money pants!

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,270
It's not gonna happen.

109
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,370
Magic money pants?

110
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,470
Come on, grunkle Stan!

111
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,240
Can't we work something out?

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,540
Look, kid. There's my room and the attic.

113
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,240
That's it. What do you think,

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,550
there's some kind of secret hidden room in the shack?

115
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,280
Dudes!

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,150
I found some kind of secret hidden room in the shack!

117
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,150
Okay, so I was cleaning up behind this bookcase,

118
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,490
when boom! Mystery door.

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,460
This old shack is full of weird secrets.

120
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,470
Classy!

121
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,480
"Experiment 78."

122
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,240
Grunkle Stan, what is this place?

123
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,310
I don't know.

124
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,350
Just another room I gotta clean up now.

125
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,480
The carpet it's amazing!

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, if you're into things that are terrible.

127
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,590
Problem solved! I'll move in here!

128
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,190
What? Why do you automatically get the room?

129
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,530
We both saw it at the same time!

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,130
Wait a second...

131
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,300
So you both want this room, huh?

132
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,430
I guess I'll give it to

133
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,300
whichever one of you I like more.

134
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,440
Uh oh. Looks like my shoe's untied!

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,210
Give it to me.

136
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,610
To the kitchen! Fight! Fight!

137
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,610
Fight! Fight!

138
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,380
Whoa. I don't know dudes.

139
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,510
This room gives me major creep-o vibes.

140
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,350
Ya know, the attic is a pretty good space.

141
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,350
Maybe you two should appreciate what you got.

142
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,190
Grunkle Stan! I gotta have that room!

143
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,320
Huh. Hey, what do I know?

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,460
Maybe there's nothing creepy going on in this room.

145
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,000
All right, kids, here's how it's gonna go down.

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,340
Whoever sucks up the hardest, gets the key to the new room.

147
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,310
Grunkle Stan, we're not going to suck up to you

148
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
just to get the new room.

149
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,340
Yeah, we are!

150
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,040
Ten suck up points for Mabel!

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,180
I mean, uh, yeah we are!

152
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,380
Trying too hard. Minus 15 suck up points.

153
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,950
- What? 
- Good decision, grunkle Stan!

154
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,150
Trying way too hard! Plus 50 suck up points.

155
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,960
Now who wants to re-tile the roof

156
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,020
In searing 105 degree heat!

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,120
Me! Me! I'll do it!

158
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,060
Me! No, Dipper! Give it here!

159
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,130
Ahh, Stan, you're a good uncle.

160
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll kill you!

161
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,040
Dipper! You're phoning it in!

162
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,140
Ahh. Man, that's refreshing.

163
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,940
Ten suck up points for this lemonade.

164
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,210
Thank you, Stan.

165
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,340
Oh, ho! Ten more for politeness.

166
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,350
Oh, and so sweet!

167
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,350
All these chores will be worth it when I get this room.

168
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,350
Shag carpeting... come on!

169
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Hey, brother. Don't get too comfortable,

170
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,960
I just made Stan an omelet shaped like his own face.

171
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,360
I have seen the face of beauty.

172
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,070
Face it. I'm like a suck up ninja!

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,330
This room's as good as mine!

174
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,440
You might as well give up now.

175
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,000
What do you say?

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,940
I say, I'm gonna win this room somehow,

177
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,010
And when I do...

178
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,310
I'll finally have my own space,

179
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,080
And we'll never have to share anything ever again!

180
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,050
Ugh...what happened?

181
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,950
Dipper?

182
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,350
Why are you wearing my clothes?

183
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,390
And my... face!?

184
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,330
Am I in my your body?

185
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
Am I in my your body?

186
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,970
Get out! Get out!

187
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,970
Get out!

188
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,140
This isn't happening.

189
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
This isn't happening. This isn't happening.

190
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,380
Great, just what we need.

191
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,250
More gravity falls weirdness.

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,990
This is stupid!

193
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,950
Sharing a room was bad enough.

194
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,420
Now we're sharing bodies?

195
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,320
Ugh, braces are horrible.

196
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,130
It's like my mouth hates me!

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,090
And what are these things?

198
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,030
I wanna know why you're so sweaty!

199
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,400
- And awkward. 
- Hey, look!

200
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,930
Experiment 78!

201
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,140
Electron carpet.

202
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,040
Atoms can swap electrons.

203
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,370
This carpet must build up a static charge

204
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,180
so powerful it can swap minds.

205
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,380
It was the static electricity.

206
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,010
Maybe, we could use it to switch back!

207
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,350
Phew. Oh, oh!

208
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,050
Glad I'm switchin' back.

209
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,980
If I was you, I would totally lose the contest.

210
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,390
And if I was you, which I am...

211
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,160
I could sabotage myself!

212
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,390
Then Mabel would lose all her points

213
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,930
and the room would go to Dipper!

214
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,930
Wait, what?

215
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, Stan!

216
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,260
I've always hated you!

217
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,030
Ha ha! See who he gives the room to now!

218
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,400
No! Wait!

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,170
Tie your shoes!!

220
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,370
Mmm... those cannibals are onto something,

221
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,320
I taste delicious!

222
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,350
Grunkle Stan!

223
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,350
What's the word, Mabel?

224
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,610
That's right! It's me, ugh, Mabel!

225
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,320
If you like that omelet, you'll love this...

226
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,420
A sandwich made out of rocks!

227
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,450
Candy rocks?

228
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,590
Regular rocks!

229
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,630
Keep that up, and I'll be giving your brother this key.

230
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,290
Ha ha! I mean... darn.

231
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,630
Hey, grunkle Stan!

232
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,320
Your face looks like a butt!

233
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,700
What?!

234
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,470
Breaking stuff is so much fun!

235
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,440
I am Dipper and I stink!

236
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,400
Mabel's gone bananas!

237
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,310
Well, this is getting weird.

238
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,410
Wait!

239
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,510
Are you gonna dock Mabel points?

240
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,310
Dipper should lose all his points!

241
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,450
Ugh! Grunkle Stan!

242
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,290
Waddles, you got it good, bro.

243
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
You got no worries.

244
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,590
I mean, nobody thinks it's cute

245
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,620
When I lie naked on the living room floor.

246
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,460
I wish I could be a pig.

247
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes!

248
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,470
I should do out loud wishing more often.

249
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,600
Is that a corn cob I spy?

250
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,470
I got little legs!

251
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,440
Hey, Soos. What's up?

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,540
Have you seen my--

253
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,350
Uh... I'll come back later.

254
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,620
Grunkle Stan, come back!

255
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,420
I have more terrible things to do!

256
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,560
You're toast, Mabel!

257
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,660
That room's as good as mine!

258
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,690
There you are Mabel!

259
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,260
- Attack her with love! 
- Yeah!

260
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,700
Sleep over!

261
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,460
What!? No no no!

262
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,530
Ahh! Dipper? Hey, wait!

263
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,920
Wait, come back!

264
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,440
Hey! Could I talk to my, uh, sister for a sec?

265
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,480
This is a sleepover buddy. No boys allowed!

266
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,650
Look guys, I'm not really in a sleepover mood right now.

267
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,550
One of my irrational girl mood swings, you know?

268
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,250
Right? Don't we have those?

269
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,260
Come on! My mom's age-inappropriate romance novels

270
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,460
Aren't going to read themselves!

271
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,460
Oh! "Wolfman, barechest"!

272
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,530
Uh, really, I should probably..

273
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,430
Come on! You know you love it!!!

274
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,600
"My name is Gerard.

275
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,340
"I am a werewolf, creature of the night.

276
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,310
But I am also a creature of passion."

277
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,380
Gerard is just so fierce.

278
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,410
What's goin' on, Dipper?

279
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,450
Ahh... you're at that creepy age where you spy on girls, huh?

280
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,450
Guess it's time you and me had a man-to-man talk

281
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,220
About the birds and the bees, ya know.

282
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,360
I--I should really be going--

283
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,460
No way out of it!

284
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,660
Look, it all begins with this little fella,

285
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,360
The pituitary gland.

286
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,630
He may be little, but he has big plans.

287
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,240
I wonder what rollicking adventures I'll stumble into.

288
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,670
A mud puddle!

289
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,540
Do I dare live out the cliche?

290
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,350
I'm a pig! Oink oink, right?

291
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,450
Free meal!

292
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,650
No! Don't eat me!

293
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,450
I'm a man trapped in a pig's body!

294
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,620
That's what they all say!

295
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,330
Help! Police!

296
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
A bearded witch chasing a talking pig!

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,570
My horoscope came true.

298
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,630
Now read mine!

299
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,600
- What are you, gemini? 
- You knew?!

300
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,670
Yeah, of course, I knew!

301
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,570
And now you know where babies come from.

302
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,240
Goodbye, childhood.

303
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,480
You know, I find you more likable today than usual.

304
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,280
Maybe you could still win that game after all.

305
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,350
Huh?

306
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,320
I was gonna give that new room to Mabel--

307
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,680
No, you should! Give it to Mabel!

308
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,170
You big jerk!

309
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,550
What did you say to me?

310
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,260
I said, uh, shut up, old man!

311
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,390
You're fat and dumb, and you're a dummy.

312
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,630
And take that!

313
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,100
Finally Standing up to me, huh?

314
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,240
I love it!

315
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,630
You know, I've made up my mind.

316
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,670
The room belongs to you, Dipper.

317
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,670
You can't!

318
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,710
You have to give it to Mabel!

319
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,710
Shh.

320
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,410
You had me at "Shut up old man."

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,610
No!

322
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,250
The end.

323
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,620
Now for the 38 sequels!

324
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,280
No!

325
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,420
I'm gonna make you into bacon!

326
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,220
Oh, ho! That sounds pretty good.

327
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,220
Wait, I mean, no!

328
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,060
Three, four, five.

329
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,600
It's him! My dream date!

330
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,270
Hello!?

331
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,540
Hello baby, this is Kevin.

332
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,200
My beach house has room... for two.

333
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Kevin has the voice of a robot.

334
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't ruin this for me, Candy!

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,440
It's your turn, Mabel.

336
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,210
I gotta win the room.

337
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,220
Stan! It's me, Mabel!

338
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,550
I'm doing things you hate!

339
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,490
It's over, Dipper.

340
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,390
Stan gave you the room.

341
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,230
Ha ha! Yes! All right!

342
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,470
Well let's switch bodies then, and I can start moving in!

343
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Wait a minute, you can't have the room...

344
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,470
If you can never get in!

345
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,610
Hey, come back!

346
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,580
Come on!

347
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,210
Open the door, Dipper!

348
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,450
I mean... Mabel.

349
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,350
How am I ever gonna get in there?

350
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Kevin for the last time, I'm not interested!

351
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,460
How could you say that to Kevin!

352
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,430
Hey girls, who wants to give my brother a make-over!

353
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,480
Oh, good, Soos.

354
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Ya got a second?

355
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,560
Look, times are tough, economy, or something, etc.

356
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,660
Basically... I have to cut your pay.

357
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,400
Wh-- what are you doing?

358
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,470
Is this some sort of negotiating tactic?

359
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,470
'cause it's not gonna to work.

360
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,140
Fine! I was lying. I'll give you a raise!

361
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,440
Just never do that again.

362
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,540
Ugh. Nightmare.

363
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,450
Can you help me? I'm looking for directions--

364
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,350
Oh, you'll show me the way?

365
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,560
Such a gentleman!

366
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,160
It's Candy and Grenda!

367
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,230
Friends!

368
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
Hey guys!

369
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,300
What's up?

370
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,270
Dipper?! Wait! Don't let him in here!

371
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,370
Make over!

372
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,540
No, no! Stop, stop! Whoa, no!

373
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,340
We're gonna make you so hot!

374
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,510
Wait, no! Stop!

375
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,580
Guys, you have to listen to me!

376
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,480
No!

377
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,180
Good job, ladies!

378
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,650
Now let me just add one final touch!

379
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,450
My body!

380
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,260
I'm a genius!

381
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,560
Ugh... all right, Mabel.

382
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,630
The room is mine.

383
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,630
Wait! Hold on here. What just happened?

384
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,330
I barely understand it.

385
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,570
All I know, is if you shuffle your feet on this carpet,

386
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,200
you can switch bodies or whatever.

387
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,440
- Zip zip! 
- No!

388
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,480
Aw, come on!

389
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,550
I am a boy now!

390
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,610
What's up, brah?

391
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,380
Lets grow some moustaches!

392
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,250
Dipper, give me that key back!

393
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,620
Guys! Stop fighting!

394
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,220
Oh, no!

395
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,390
Then again, I like having muscles for once

396
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,360
Now I have tiny little doll hands!

397
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,460
Everybody, look.

398
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,400
Swap back in three, two--

399
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,530
Oh, dude!

400
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,630
Come back! I wanna deep fry yer ears!

401
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,440
Tonight on baby fights!

402
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,540
Tensions rise between madison and avery

403
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,180
at baby fight headquartes.

404
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,380
Give me my body back!

405
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,520
Cool! I'm santa claus!

406
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,420
I've regained my innocence!

407
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,560
Well, I guess I'm a pig now.

408
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,190
So, that's a thing.

409
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
This body's not that different

410
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,300
From my old one.

411
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,430
We got some reports of excessive giggling.

412
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,610
My horoscope didn't say anything about this!

413
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,180
Ahh! What's happening to me?!

414
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,610
I am a police officer now!

415
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,220
Let's go get some perps, Candy!

416
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,520
- Give me that key, Mabel! 
- Never!

417
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,490
Mabel, are you you?

418
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,430
Yeah, I'm me.

419
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,560
Well, I've got the key!

420
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,240
Mabel! The room is mine!

421
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,540
Give it to me!

422
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,440
What's with you?

423
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,310
Why do you need that room so bad?

424
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,350
I never even wanted to move out!

425
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Me either!

426
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,180
Wait, what? Say that again!

427
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,120
I--I never wanted to move out.

428
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,490
Then what was all this?

429
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,630
Everything was fine until you started bringing

430
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,260
your friends around every night.

431
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,930
I mean, hanging out with you this summer's been fun.

432
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,230
But now, you're always with Candy and Grenda.

433
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,000
And I'm... like, just left behind.

434
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,240
Aw, Dipper.

435
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,300
It's okay.

436
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,710
I've been having a hard time.

437
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,810
You wouldn't understand what I'm going through.

438
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,080
You're probably feeling awkward and sweaty, huh?

439
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,910
Yeah. How'd you know?

440
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,880
Here. I won't fight you for it.

441
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
Thanks.

442
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,520
Well, it looks like everyone's back to normal!

443
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,860
Except for Soos, who may be pig permanently?

444
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,460
Oh, no. I changed back.

445
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,530
At least I think I did.

446
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,700
I'll still eat ya.

447
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,940
Okay pal, that's enough of that.

448
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,640
Move it along, weird old man.

449
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,570
Huh, I guess being a pig wasn't that great after all.

450
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,740
Hey, lemme get that spot you can never reach...

451
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,510
Hey, I've been thinking and the answer is...

452
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,520
Yes! I will marry you!

453
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,820
Wait I don't remember anything about a--

454
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,920
Hmm. All right.

455
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,590
Ah, there.

456
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,760
Ahh, a man in his own space.

457
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,660
That's right! Finally.

458
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
So what are you gonna do with this old thing?

459
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,770
Get rid of it.

460
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Ha ha! You got it.

461
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,970
This carpet's ugly.

462
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,680
Ah, finally, my own room.

463
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,510
Goodnight, Mabel.

464
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,680
Goodnight, Dipper.

465
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,530
Hey, um, you wanna have a sleepover?

466
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,970
Fore!

467
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,810
Ah! Why am I even out here at night?

468
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,580
So, what are we gonna do with that new room?

469
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,850
I gave it to Soos to replace

470
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,680
that horrible break room he has.

471
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Hey, do you know what the deal was with that lady?

472
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,750
I just don't think I can do this anymore.

473
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,890
You just seem so... different.

474
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,490
Look, dude, uh, I'm playing a little bit of catch up here.

475
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,830
I was in a pig's body for most of the day.

476
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
What's going on?

477
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,770
Can we kiss again?

478
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,540
Is that an option?

479
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,840
Oh! Wait, wait.
