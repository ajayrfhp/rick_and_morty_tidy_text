1
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:05,454
Wait up.
Yeah, you should keep up.

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:06,913
I can keep up.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:10,334
Whoa!

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,651
Neato!

5
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:15,130
Mysterious,
boarded-up cave.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,723
It might be filled with
lost prehistoric life forms.

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,042
Or Mesoamerican gold.

8
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:20,427
Uh, ladies first.

[both giggling]

10
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,885
Ha ha! Good thing you've
got your smarts, Poindexter.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,779
I've got the other thing.

12
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,773
What is it called?
Oh, right, punching.

13
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,427
Cool. Splinters.

14
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:39,913
Whoa! It's
so creepy in here.

15
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:41,482
Hey, don't worry, bro.

16
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,392
Wherever we go,
we go together.

17
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,869
Don't forget to leave
our names so they know
who owns the place.

18
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,875
Pines, Pines,
Pines, Pines.

19
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:38,355
Finally, after all
these long years of waiting,

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,548
you're actually here.

21
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:44,219
Brother!

22
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,089
Ow! What the heck
was that for?

23
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:49,316
This was an insanely
risky move,

24
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,159
restarting the portal.

25
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,694
Didn't you read
my warnings?

26
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,655
Warnings, schmarnings.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,915
How's about maybe
a thanks for saving you

28
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,966
from what appears to be,
I don't know,

29
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,377
some kinda sci-fi
sideburn dimension.

30
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,154
Thank you? You really think
I'm gonna thank you

31
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,798
after what you did
30 years ago?

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,374
What I did?

33
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,534
Why, you ungrateful...

34
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,614
Don't expect me
to go easy on you

35
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,642
just because
you're family.

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,793
Hey, hi.
Mabel here.

37
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,670
Quick question.

38
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,838
What the heck
is going on here?

39
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,092
Stan, you didn't tell me
there were children down here.

40
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,469
And some sort of
large, hairless gopher.

41
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:28,422
Ha ha, I get that a lot.

42
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,039
They're your family,
Poindexter.

43

Shermy's grandkids.

44
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,203
I have a niece,
and a nephew?

45
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,955
Greetings. Do kids
still say greetings?

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,258
I haven't been in
this dimension for
a really long time.

47
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,619
Whoa, six-fingered
handshake.

48
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,763
It's a full finger
friendlier than normal.

49
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,873
Ha ha, I like this kid.
She's weird.

50
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:49,267
I... I can't believe it.

51
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,452
You're the author
of the journals.

52
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,530
You've read
my journals?

53
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,207
I haven't just read them.

54
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,325
I've lived them.

55
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,535
I've been waiting
for so long to meet you.

56
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:00,737
I don't know what to say.
I have so many questions.

57

[hyperventilating]

58
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,983
I think I'm gonna
throw up.

59
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,726
No, no, false alarm.

60
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,246
Just gotta ride it out.

61
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,055
Listen, there'll be time
for introductions later.

62
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,983
But first, tell me, Stan.

63
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,867
Are there any
security breaches?

64
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,653
Does anyone else
know about this portal?

65
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,080
No. Just us.

66
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,123
Also, maybe the entire
U.S. government.

67

<i> and those kids.</i>

70
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,224
Okay. It's all right.

71
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,317
We've got a while before
they find this room.

72
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:34,012
We just need to lay low
and think of a plan.

73
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,114
It looks like we're
stuck down here for a while.

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,984
Who wants to tell us their
entire mysterious backstory?

75
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,653
Yes, I have some questions
about all this myself, Stanley.

76
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,623
Stanley?

77
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,474
But your name
is Stanford.

78
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,393
Wait, you took my name?

79
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,921
What have you been
doing all these years,
you knucklehead?

80
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:52,680
Yeah, Grunkle Stan,
no more lies.

81
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,216
You owe us some answers.

82
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,609
What's the deal
with this portal?

83
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,460
Why did you keep
this a secret?

84
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,588
And what happened
between you and your brother?

85
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:02,123
I'm hoping all this aligns
exactly with my fan-fic, Stan.

86
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,258
If not, I will be
very disappointed.

87
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,286
Okay. Okay, okay.

88

a lot of explaining to do.

159
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:00,193
<i> Pines twins to</i>
<i> the principal's office.</i>

160
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,912
Ah, great.
What is it this time?

161
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,621
Not you. Him.

162
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,081
Now, Mr. Pines, I'd like to
speak with you

163
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,708
very frankly,
if I may.

164
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:17,034
Very frankly
is the only way I speak.

165
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,578
You have two sons.

166
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,589
One of them
is incredibly gifted.

167
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:22,699
The other one is standing
outside this room,
and his name's Stanley.

168
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,226
What are you saying?

169
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:28,004
I'm saying your son
Stanford is a genius!

170
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,881
All of his teachers
are going bananas

171
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,799
over his science fair
experiment.

172
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,284
You ever heard of
West Coast Tech?

173
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,294
Best college
in the country.

174
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,304
Their graduates turn
science fiction

175
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,206
into science fact.

176
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,233
The admissions team
is visiting tomorrow

177
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,552
to check out
Stanford's experiment.

178
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,912
Your son may be
a future millionaire, Mr. Pines.

179
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:46,506
I'm impressed.

180
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,067
What about our little
free spirit Stanley?

181
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,768
That clown?
At this rate,

182
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,137
he'll be lucky
to graduate high school.

183
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,006
Look, there's a saltwater
taffy store on the dock,

184
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,742
and somebody's gotta
get paid to scrape
the barnacles off of it.

185
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:02,071
Stanford's going places, but
hey, look on the bright side.

186
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,916
At least you'll have one son
here in New Jersey forever.

187
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,793
Joke's on them
if they think

188
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,544
you wanna go to
some stuffy college

189
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,262
on the other side
of the country.

190
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:12,448
Once we get
the <i> Stan O' War </i> complete,

191
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,058
it's gonna be
beaches, babes,

192
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,043
and international
treasure hunting for us.

193
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,222
Look, Stan,
I can't pass up
a chance like this.

194
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,007
This school has
cutting-edge programs

195
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,017
and multi-dimensional
paradigm theory.

196
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,837
Be-boop. I am a nerd robot.

197
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,222
That's you.
That's what you sound like.

198
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,324
[chuckles]
Ah, well,

199
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,244
if the college board
isn't impressed with
my experiment tomorrow,

200
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,787
then okay, I'll do
the treasure hunting thing.

201
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,473
And if they are?

202
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,841
Well, then I guess
you better come visit me

203
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:40,468
on the other side
of the country.

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,275
<i> Without Ford, I was just</i>
<i> half of a dynamic duo.</i>

205
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,627
<i> I couldn't make it</i>
<i> out there without him.</i>

206
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,270
<i> And now, thanks to</i>
<i> that dumb college,</i>

207
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:53,022
<i> I was gonna lose</i>
<i> my brother forever.</i>

208
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,346
This is all your fault,
you dumb machine!

209
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,823
Oh, no. No, no, no.
What did I do?

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,028
There. All right.

211
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,121
Good as new.
Probably.

212
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,586
All right, kid,
show us what you got.

213
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,897
Okay. Well,
what would you say

214
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,682
if I told you
the future of technology

215
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,809
was beneath this sheet?

216
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,085
I'd say we wasted
a car trip.

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,705
What?

218
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,258
But it was stable yesterday.

219
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,451
A fuse must've blown
or something.

220
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,194
Kid, a perpetual motion
machine has one job--

221
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,638
to not stop.

222
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,708
I don't think you're
West Coast Tech material.

223
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,300
No, wait. Don't go!

224
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,694
I worked so hard.

225
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,451
One paddle paddle paddle,
two paddle paddle.

226
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,337
Man, that Jackie O.
What a fox.

227
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,064
Hey, what's the word,
sixer?

228
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,681
Can you explain
what this was doing

229
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,567
next to my broken
project?

230
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,170
Okay. I might've
accidentally been...

231
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,464
horsing around.

232
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,349
This was no accident, Stan.
You did this.

233
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,075
You did this because
you couldn't handle me

234
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,268
going to college
on my own.

235
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,171
Look, it was a mistake.

236
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,480
Although, if you
think about it,

237
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,232
maybe there's
a silver lining.

238
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,083
Huh? Treasure hunting?

239
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,144
Are you kidding me?

240
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,779
Why would I wanna do
anything with the person

241
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,198
who sabotaged
my entire future?

242
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,101
You did what,
you knucklehead?

243
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,738
Stanley, what's
going on in here?

244
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,281
Wait, no.
I can explain.
It was a mistake.

245
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,658
You ignoramus.

246
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,811
Your brother was gonna be
our ticket outta this dump.

247
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,921
All you ever do
is lie and cheat,

248
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:34,181
and ride on
your brother's coattails.

249
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,059
Well, this time,
you cost our family

250
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,918
potential millions.

251
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,020
And until you
make us a fortune,

252
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,739
you're not welcome
in this household.

253
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,092
What?! Stanford, tell him
he's being crazy.

254
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,156
Stanford? Don't
leave me hanging.

255
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,683
High six?

256
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:57,246
Fine! I can make it
on my own.

257
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,348
I don't need you,
I don't need anyone.

258
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,541
I'll make millions,
and you'll rue the day

259
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,611
you turned
your back on me.

260
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,070
<i> Thanks to one dumb mistake,</i>
<i> I had no brother,</i>

261
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,648
<i> no home, no nothing.</i>

262
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,741
<i> But I had a plan</i>
<i> to fix everything.</i>

263
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,348
Oh, this story's
so sad.

264
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,667
I know what you two
little broken teacups need.

265
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:19,635
To hug it out.

266
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,996
Hug it out.

267
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:24,406
Hug train
comin' in the station.

268
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:27,602
Hugapalooza 2000!

269
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:29,395
Kid, will you
knock that off?

270
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,122
I'm trying to tell
my life story here.

271
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,809
<i> I had decided I wasn't</i>
<i> gonna show my face at home</i>

272
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,986
<i> till I proved I could</i>
<i> make something of myself.</i>

273
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,179
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> the treasure hunting business</i>

274
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,857
<i> was slow going.</i>

275
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,718
<i> Apparently, gold is</i>
<i> some kind of rare metal.</i>

276
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,619
<i> Luckily, I struck</i>
<i> another kind of gold.</i>

277
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,097
<i> In sales.</i>

278
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,415
Hi there.
I'm Stan Pines

279
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,517
of Stanco Enterprises.

280
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,712
Are you sick of this
always happening to you?

281
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,489
Then you need
the chamois of the future.

282
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,009
Made with the same material
astronauts use

283
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:02,220
to clean up cranberry
stains on the moon.

284
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,445
That's the Sham Total.

285
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,565
It's a total sham.

286
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,393
<i> I had made my mark,</i>
<i> all right.</i>

287
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,227
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> so did the chamois.</i>

288
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,429
<i> Apparently, the cheap dye</i>
<i> I used to color them</i>

289
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,640
<i> only made stains worse.</i>

290
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,626
<i> Customers weren't</i>
<i> crazy about that.</i>

291
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,969
<i> Luckily, they were</i>
<i> chasing me </i>

292
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,187
<i> with Stanco-brand</i>
<i> pitchforks.</i>

293
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:22,998
Suckers!

294
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,875
<i> I was officially banned</i>
<i> from New Jersey.</i>

295
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,344
<i> But with a quick name change,</i>

296
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,412
<i> Steve Pinington was ready</i>
<i> to take on Pennsylvania.</i>

297
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,749
Hi. I'm Steve Pinington.

298
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,741
Are you sick of bandages
that are hard to remove?

299
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,560
Then what you need is
the Rip Off.

300
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:36,562
The Rip Off won't
give you rashes.

301
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:38,506
I repeat, it won't
give you rashes.

302
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,208
<i> It gave you rashes.</i>

303
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,504
<i> I traveled</i>
<i> the whole country,</i>

304
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,198
<i> sometimes</i>
<i> outside of it,</i>

305
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,425
<i> always one step ahead</i>
<i> of the law,</i>

306
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,887
<i> looking for something</i>
<i> that would be my big break.</i>

307
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,989
Whoa. So that explains
all the fake ID's.

308
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,933
But wait,
what about you?

309
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,401
Did you end up going
to your dream school?

310
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,987
Not exactly.

311
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,646
All right, I know
Backupsmore

312
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,673
wasn't anyone's

325
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,057

327
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,704
<i> But that got me thinking</i>

328
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,039
<i> Things that were odd,</i>
<i> unusual,</i>

<i> statistically improbable.</i>

330

<i> And according to</i>

331
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,738

You say you're trying

a trans-universal
poly-dimensional meta vortex?

Hey, easy there.
Let's talk this
through, okay?

437
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,187
I have something
to show you.

438

Something you won't believe.

439
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,883
I've been around
the world, okay?

440
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,144
Whatever it is,
I'll understand.

441
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,056
There is nothing
about this I understand.

442
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,267
It's a trans-universal
gateway,

443
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,853
a punched hole through
a weak spot in our dimension.

444
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,147
I created it to unlock
the mysteries of the universe.

445
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,465
But it could just as easily
be harnessed

446
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,793
for terrible destruction.

447
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,519
That's why I shut it down
and hid my journals

448
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,229
which explain
how to operate it.

449
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,323
There's only
one journal left.

450
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,993
You are the only person
I can trust to take it.

451
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,978
I have something
to ask of you.

452
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,589
Remember our plans
to sail around the world

453
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,907
on a boat?

454
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,776
Take this book,
get on a boat,

455
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,978
and sail as far away
as you can.

456
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,371
To the edge
of the earth.

457
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,415
Bury it where
no one can find it.

458
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,502
That's it?

459
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:43,355
You finally wanna see me
after ten years,

460
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,850
and it's to tell me to get as
far away from you as possible?

461
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,768
Stanley, you don't
understand what I'm up against.

462
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,962
What I've been through.

463
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,522
No, no, you don't understand
what I've been through.

464
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,890
I've been to prison
in three different countries.

465
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,235
I once had to chew my way
out of the trunk of a car.

466
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,945
You think you've
got problems?

467
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,155
I've got
a mullet, Stanford.

468
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,416
Meanwhile,
where have you been?

469
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,452
Living it up in
your fancy house
in the woods,

470
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,512
selfishly hoarding
your college money,

471
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,029
because you only
care about yourself.

472
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:10,215
I'm selfish?
I'm selfish?

473
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,959
Stanley, how can
you say that

474
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,877
after costing me
my dream school?

475
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,864
I'm giving you a chance
to do the first worthwhile
thing in your life,

476
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,173
and you won't
even listen.

477
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,992
Well, listen to this.

478
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,819
You want me to get rid
of this book?

479
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,211
Fine, I'll get rid of it
right now.

480
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:24,789
No! You don't understand.

481
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,249
You said you wanted
me to have it,

482
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,217
so I'll do what
I want with it.
My research!

483
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,264
Stanley, give it back.

484
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:37,601
You want it back,
you're gonna have to
try harder than that.

485
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,439
You left me behind,
you jerk.

486
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,625
It was supposed to be
us forever.

487
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,318
You ruined my life.
You ruined your own life.

488
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,723
Stanley. Oh, my gosh,
I'm so sorry.

489
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,741
Are you all right?

490
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,808
Some brother you
turned out to be.

491
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,218
You care more about
your dumb mysteries
than your family.

492
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,663
Then you can have 'em.

493
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,349
Whoa, whoa, hey.
What's going on?

494
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:10,942
Hey, Stanford...
Stanley, help me.

495
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,920
What do I do?
Stanley!

496
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,896
Stanley,
do something!

497
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,598
[screaming]

498
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:20,728
Stanford?

499
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,232
Stanford, come back.
I didn't mean it.

500
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,578
I just got him back.

501
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:31,647
I can't lose him again.

502
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,031
Come on!

503
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,534
[echoing]
Stanford!

504
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,911
<i> I lost him.</i>

505
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,871
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if he was dead or alive</i>

506
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,924
<i> in some distant galaxy,</i>

507
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,509
<i> but I knew his journal</i>
<i> must have the answer</i>

508
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:45,002
<i> to getting him back...</i>
<i> somehow.</i>

509
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:53,260
<i> I didn't get</i>
<i> much sleep that night.</i>

510
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,607
<i> Or the night</i>
<i> after that.</i>

511
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:01,852
<i> I tried for weeks to turn</i>
<i> that dumb machine back on.</i>

512
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,836
<i> But without</i>
<i> the other two journals,</i>

513
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:05,339
<i> it was hopeless.</i>

514
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,274
<i> Finally,</i>
<i> I ran out of food.</i>

515
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,026
<i> I had no choice</i>
<i> but to go into town.</i>

516
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,006
Just the bread then,
stranger?

517
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,449
That'll be 99 cents.

518
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,629
Hey, that's no stranger.

519
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:22,840
That must be
the mysterious science guy

520
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,042
that lives in the woods.

521
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,728
No, no, you got
the wrong guy.

522
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,973
I've heard strange stories
about that old shack.

523
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,184
Yeah, mysterious lights
and spooky experiments.

524
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,945
Gosh, I'd pay anything

525
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,273
to see what kind of
shenanigans you get
up to in there.

526
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:41,976
Me, too.
Do you ever give tours?

527
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:43,977
No, really, I...

528
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,072
[sighs]

529
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,316
Yes, I do give tours.

530
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:51,293
Ten... no, no,
15 bucks a person.

531
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,861
[cheering excitedly]

532
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,641
So what did you say
your name was,

533
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,684
you man of mystery?

534
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,495
Oh, Stan... ford.

535
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,747
Stanford Pines.

536
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,310
Step right up, folks,

537
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,096
to a world of
enchantment or whatever.

538
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:14,241
Behold the nerdy
science box.

539
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:15,442
[electricity zaps]

540
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,195
Ah! My eye!

541
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,681
Uh, I can assure you,
that is in no way permanent.

542
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:24,618
I paid $15 for this?
[people grumbling]

543
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,988
Uh, you're lucky you weren't
part of the last tour group.

544
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,674
They never made it
out alive.

545
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,459
[chuckles nervously]
Right?

546
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,395
[laughter]

547
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,372
Funny.

548
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,357
<i> So I came up</i>
<i> with a plan.</i>

549
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:41,067
<i> I couldn't leave</i>
<i> my brother's house</i>

550
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,677
<i> until I figured out</i>
<i> how to save him.</i>

551
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:43,454
<i> But I needed to pay</i>
<i> his mortgage somehow.</i>

552
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,294
<i> For once in my life,</i>

553
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,138
<i> people were actually</i>
<i> buying what I was selling.</i>

554
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,023
<i> And so,</i>
<i> the Murder Hut was born.</i>

555
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,009
<i> Later renamed</i>
<i> the Mystery Shack.</i>

556
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,694
<i> Finally, I'd found</i>
<i> something I was good at.</i>

557
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,097
<i> For once, being</i>
<i> a liar and a cheat paid off.</i>

558
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,599
<i> The old me was dead.</i>

559
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:07,544
<i> And I faked a car crash</i>
<i> to prove it.</i>

560
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,771
<i> By day, I was Stanford Pines,</i>
<i> Mr. Mystery.</i>

561
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,760
<i> But by night, I was</i>
<i> down in the basement,</i>

562
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:16,028
<i> trying to bring</i>
<i> the real Stanford back.</i>

563
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:20,173
<i> I couldn't risk anyone</i>
<i> learning the truth</i>

564
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,583
<i> and sabotaging my mission.</i>

565
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,402
So I lied to everyone.

566
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:25,037
The town, my family,
your parents.

567
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,672
Even you kids.

568
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,725
So all this time,
you were just trying
to save your brother.

569
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,528
Grunkle Stan, I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

570
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:35,464
That's okay, kid.

571
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:37,808
I probably wouldn't
have believed me either.

572
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,560
[man] I heard talking.
It was coming from downstairs.

573
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:41,262
We're too late.
The agents are
coming for us.

574
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,647
What'll we do?

575
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,682
Oh, man, I was so spellbound
by your dramatic tale,

576
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,092
I forgot all about
those dudes.

577
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,861
Wait. Forget.
That's it.

578
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:53,081
I think I know a way we might
be able to defeat those agents.

579
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,409
Of course.

580
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:56,251
I don't know how you
got a hold of one of these,

581
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,920
but this is perfect.

582
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,323
I can just amplify the signal
to a radio headset frequency.

583
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,995
There. Now everyone,
plug your ears!

584
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,313
Get down now!

585
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,148
Sir, looks like there's
a hidden door

586
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:11,592
behind the vending machines.

587
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:15,195
Excellent. Get me
Washington on line one.

588
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,305
I've been practicing making
sounds of excitement for
this very occasion.

589
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,590
Hey, do you hear that?

590
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:32,187
What? Where am I?

591
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:35,532
Why am I standing in
some sort of goofy,
fun knick-knack house?

592
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,743
Stand down, gentlemen.

593
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,211
I've been sent with the latest
intel from Washington.

594
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,397
According to this
very real report,

595
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:43,415
the power surges
in Gravity Falls

596
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,408
were actually
due to radiation

597
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,552
from an unreported
meteor shower.

598
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,904
A total embarrassment
for your whole department.

599
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Luckily, I'm here to take
this mess off your hands.

600
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,192
I'll need all of your
floppy disks,

601
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:57,671
and, uh, eight tracks.
Right?

602
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:02,301
Uh, everything about
this case is contained
on this drive.

603
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:03,893
Well, what are you
waiting for?
A kiss on the cheek?

604
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,362
Get outta here before
I have your butts
court-martialed.

605
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,399
Uh, yes, sir.
Apologies, sir.

606
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,092
[whistles]
False alarm, everyone.

607
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:12,978
Whoa.

608
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,917
Great-uncle Stanford,
that was amazing.

609
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,710
Let's not go crazy.
It was serviceable.

610
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:30,195
Ha ha, thank you, kids.

611
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,156
But please, call me Ford.

612
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,766
Sure. Thanks,
great-uncle Ford.

613
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,818
So, uh, would you mind
if I asked you

614
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:37,902
a couple million questions
about Gravity Falls?

615
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:40,722
Um, well, I, uh...

616
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,582
All right, kids,
it's been a long day.

617
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:45,177
Me and my brother have
a lot to talk about.

618
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,928
Why don't you
hit the hay, huh?
But it's the author.

619
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:48,238
I've been waiting so long
to ask questions about--

620
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,807
I said, hit the hay!

621
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,230
I'll just let myself out.

622
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,674
[phone dialing]

623
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,342
Wendy, I've got something
amazing to tell you.

624
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,818
Clear the next
14 hours.

625
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,763
Look at us.

626
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,598
When did we become
old men?

627
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:08,550
You look like Dad.

628
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,778
Don't say that.
[both laughing]

629
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,506
[sighs]
Okay, Stanley,
here's the deal.

630
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,967
You can stay here for the summer
to watch the kids.

631
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,760
I'll stay down in
the basement

632
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,428
and try to contain
any remaining damage.

633
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:22,289
When the summer's over,

634
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:23,874
you give me
my house back,

635
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,759
you give me
my name back,

636
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,235
and this Mystery Shack
junk is over forever.

637
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,596
You got it?

638
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:30,222
You really aren't gonna
thank me, are you?

639
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,475
Fine. On one condition.

640
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:36,194
Stay away from the kids.

641
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:37,821
I don't want them
in danger.

642
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,756
'Cause as far as
I'm concerned,

643
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,025
they're the only family
I have left.

644
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,149
Did you hear
what they said?

645
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,768
I think Uncle Ford said
they're gonna buy us

646
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,787
puppies made of
ice cream.

647
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,597
Might be wishful
thinking, though.

648
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,274
I don't know if this
is good or bad.

649
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,701
I wanted to meet
the author, but...

650
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:02,195
Yeah. I liked the way
things were here before.

651
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:04,531
Just us and Stan,

652
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,583
and the occasional
goblin monster.

653
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,353
I'm sure they'll
work things out.

654
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,104
Dipper, you don't think
we'll turn out

655
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:12,664
like Stan and Ford,
do you?

656
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,983
What do you mean?

657
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,685
I mean, they used to be
best friends,

658
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:20,489
but then, they got
all stupid.

659
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,491
Can you promise me
you won't get stupid?

660
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,692
Not stupider than you,
dum-dum.

661
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:27,220
[giggles]
Good night, stupid.

662
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,947
Good night, stupid.

663
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,546
<i> [Soos] Okay, so it turns out</i>
<i> the second Stan,</i>

664
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,289
<i> the Stan</i>
<i> that we know,</i>

665
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,259
<i> was actually Stanley,</i>

666
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:42,510
<i> but the first Stan</i>
<i> was Stanford,</i>

667
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:44,321
<i> but we didn't know </i>

668
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,081
<i> until Stanford</i>
<i> came out of the portal,</i>

669
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:48,133
<i> which was built</i>
<i> by Stanford,</i>

670
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:50,260
<i> but then Stanley</i>
<i> pretending to be Stanford,</i>

671
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,520
<i> he did the portal</i>
<i> 'cause he's Stan,</i>

672
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:53,922
<i> but he's not Stan.</i>

673
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:55,765
Soos, it's 3:00
in the morning.

674
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,734
<i> Okay, okay,</i>
<i> I understand.</i>

675
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,177
<i> Anyway, act two,</i>
<i> Stan started...</i>

676
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:03,356
Aaaah!
