1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,907
Ahh!

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,542
Morning, Dipper.

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,011
Guess who.

4
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,579
Oh, what joy.

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,215
If it isn't
Mr. Upsidedownington.

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,017
How long has it been?
Third grade maybe?

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,619
That's right, and I'm here
to deliver you

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,856
an Upsidedownington-tastic
message!

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,725
Is it the message that we're
getting too old for this sort of thing?

10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,660
Um, kinda, actually.

11
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,662
It's that we're exactly
one week away

12
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,265
from our 13th birthday!

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,704
Whoa! Our birthday's
coming up already?

14
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,040
Soon we're gonna be
actual teenagers!

15
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,876
Finally I can stop reading
pre-teen magazines,

16
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,712
and start reading
post-pre-teen magazines.

17
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,248
PG-13 movies,
here I come.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,884
And just one more year
until high school.

19
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,886
High school, Dipper!

20
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,621
Where girls
become women,

21
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,189
and they teach us
stuff about...

22
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,892
you know what.

23
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,660
Trigonometry?

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,095
Oh, yeah, baby.

25
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,830
That's not the only
good news coming up.

26
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,632
In one week, my senior
citizen ponytail kit

27
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,133
is coming in the mail.

28
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,739
I'm... I'm kinda going
through some things.

29
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,808
In one week,
my grandma is finally letting me

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,142
eat crackers
on my bed.

31
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,912
The future is coming
for us all, dudes.

32
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,814
- The future.
- The future.

33
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,782
The future!

34
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,684
I'm sorry, I can't
take you seriously

35
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,086
with that face
on your chin.

36
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,154
What face, Dipper?

37
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,791
You're doing the voice,
so you obviously know what I'm talking about.

38
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,827
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,831
There is something
wrong with you.

40
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,833
There's something wrong
with both of us.

41
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,852
All right,
party planners.

42
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,020
In one week,
we become teenagers,

43
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,823
and our summer vacation
winds to an end,

44
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,859
so we need to throw
the greatest party of all time!

45
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,762
I'm talkin' piñatas
with tinier piñatas inside.

46
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,764
Boom, dreams comin' true.

47
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm talkin' inviting
everyone in town.

48
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,802
Let's see.

49
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,204
Where do we stand
with the gnomes?

50
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,240
Not so fast,
goofus and girl goofus.

51
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,041
After that
zombie incident,

52
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,277
no one's throwing
another party at my house.

53
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,980
I keep finding little
bits of the undead in the couch cushions.

54
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,850
But Grunkle Stan,
we need some roof to raise.

55
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,785
Dude, you can rent out
the Gravity Falls high school gym,

56
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,921
and have your party there.

57
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,856
That place is empty
all summer long.

58
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,858
The gym's
a great idea, Soos.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,059
To the high school!

60
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,864
Dipper, my face
is on fire!

61
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,332
I'll just be
a second.

62
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,134
Hey, Uncle Ford,
are you okay?

63
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,069
Oh, yes, I'm fine.

64
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,938
I just said that
to make sure you'd come in here quickly.

65
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,007
<i>But your face
is  on fire.</i>

66
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,975
Yes. It's much faster
than shaving.

67
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,977
Now listen, Dipper.

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,812
I have a very important
mission, and you are

69
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,848
the only one
who can help me.

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,184
Remember the rift in
dimensional space-time I showed you?

71
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,119
It's cracking.

72
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,188
This is what Bill
has been waiting for.

73
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,924
If it breaks, it'll cause
reality as we know it

74
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,959
to completely unravel.

75
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,028
A hypothetical
and catastrophic event

76
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,896
I call Weirdmageddon.

77
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,202
Bill is out there,
and he'd use any trick

78
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,937
from deception to
outright possession

79
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,972
to make this happen.

80
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,041
But for the sake of humanity,
we mustn't let it.

81
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,976
- What do we do?
- We patch the rift.

82
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,912
I'll explain on the way.

83
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,048
- Wait. What about Mabel?
- It's okay, Dipper.

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,282
You should totally
go with Grunkle Ford

85
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,951
to save the world
or whatever.

86
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,385
Are you sure?

87
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,955
We're gonna be doing
birthday junk all week.

88
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,990
Plus, I packed
those walkie-talkies.

89
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,825
Here's one for
my party mission,

90
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,060
and one for
your smarty mission.

91
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,997
Ahem. I did mention
that the fate of the universe

92
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,232
is at stake,
didn't I?

93
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,200
Hurry! We haven't
much time.

94
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,237
Okay, Dipper, it's your first
big mission with Ford,

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,105
a chance to prove yourself.

96
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,974
Don't mess this up.

97
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,942
Ow! Ha ha.

98
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm all right.

99
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,089
Whoa, Soos, I thought
you said this place was empty.

100
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,057
My dogs, what up?

101
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,293
Wendy, what are
you doing here?

102
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,262
Ugh. High school registration.

103
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,297
Oh! You know, I'm only
a year away

104
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,132
from high school
myself.

105
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,034
Would you say
your experience

106
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,136
is more rom-com
or wacky romp?

107
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,372
More like
teen horror movie.

108
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,007
High school
is the worst.

109
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,942
Classes get
super hard,

110
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,077
your body just
flat-out turns against you,

111
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,980
and worst of all,
everybody hates you.

112
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,184
Can't do it.
Can't do another year.

113
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,121
My hormones are like
a sweaty cage.

114
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,257
Why aren't they singing
about following their dreams?

115
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,094
TV taught me that
high school is like some sort of musical.

116
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,996
TV lied, man.

117
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,865
If you can avoid
growing up, do it.

118
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,400
I'd give anything
to be 12 again.

119
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,368
Anyway, what are
you guys doing here?

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,103
Just looking for a place

121
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,040
to have my 13th
birthday party.

122
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,207
Wendy Borduroy?

123
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,176
I mean Corduroy.

124
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,445
Corduroy.

125
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,148
See what I mean?

126
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,989
Master Mabel
to Dippity Dog.

127
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,390
We can have our party
at the gym,

128
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,092
but we gotta talk
about high school.

129
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,161
I'm starting to think
it might not be

130
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,064
the awesome future
we were expecting. Over.

131
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,932
<i>I'm going through
a bad patch, Mabel.</i>

132
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,134
<i>We'll talk when
I get back... .</i>

133
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,903
Dipper? Come in,
come in?

134
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,371
Hey, I know what will
make you feel better.

135
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,239
Let's deliver some invites
to your friends, huh?

136
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,507
Yeah!

137
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,184
Mabel?
Mabel, you there?

138
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,121
Listen, Dipper,
in order to seal the rift for good,

139
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,056
it's going to take an adhesive
stronger than anything on earth.

140
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:02,427
Something...
extraterrestrial in origin.

141
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,229
What do you mean?

142
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,365
Dipper, look at
the peculiar shape

143
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,166
made by those cliffs.

144
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,235
Does it remind you
of anything?

145
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,437
Hmm...

146
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,480
Shut... up.

147
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,249
According to my research,
the entire valley

148
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,285
of Gravity Falls was formed
when an extraterrestrial object

149
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,355
crash landed here
millions of years ago.

150
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,325
Did this craft cause
the town's strange properties?

151
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,327
Or, did the town's
strange properties

152
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,262
attract the craft?

153
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,164
The answer is
still unknown.

154
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,932
But that's crazy!

155
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,200
Where did the saucer go?

156
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,369
Sometimes, the strangest
things in the world

157
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,438
are right under
our noses.

158
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,974
And our feet, in this
particular instance.

159
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,410
Now, you might want
to stand back.

160
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,345
This magnet gun could
rip the fillings

161
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,113
out of a man's mouth
from a hundred feet.

162
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,185
I used to raid this thing
for parts for years.

163
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,186
Where do you think
I got the materials

164
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,387
to build my portal?

165
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,291
You-- I... words,
not working from mouth.

166
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,359
Now, come.
And take this.

167
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,494
Whoa, whoa!

168
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,030
Don't worry, I've been
down here countless times,

169
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,300
all the aliens have been dead
for millions of years.

170
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,269
Probably.

171
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,149
I can't believe there's been
a giant UFO

172
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,084
under the town
this whole time.

173
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,454
I wish my mind could be where
yours is right now, Dipper.

174
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,556
When confirmation
of extraterrestrials

175
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,391
still had that punch.

176
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,360
Now it's just sort of, meh.

177
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,566
McGucket and I used to
come down here all the time

178
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,535
to raid their tech
ad study their language.

179
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,138
This is so cool!

180
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,309
The substance we need
so seal the rift

181
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,478
is an alien adhesive,
strong enough to

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,446
keep the hull
of a spacecraft together.

183
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,315
Just one dollop of this adhesive

184
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,317
should be enough
to seal a crack in space-time.

185
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,385
Also, if it touches you,
it will seal up

186
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,020
all the orifices
in your face,

187
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,522
so try so avoid that.

188
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,391
Now, use your magnet gun
and follow me!

189
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,526
- Hup!
- Great Uncle Ford!

190
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:24,202
Your turn!
Say "hup". It helps!

191
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:28,173
Okay, just put on magnet,
leap down hole.

192
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,574
Turn on.
Come on already!

193
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,211
Magnet!

194
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,579
Hunh!

195
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,515
Aah!

196
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,649
A little help?

197
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,457
Oh, hi, Mabel.

198
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,493
You're just in time
for our one o'clock boy talk.

199
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,429
If you think that's good,
boom!

200
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,598
Me and Dipper's
13th birthday jam!

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,102
Oh, man, your birthday's
on the last day of summer.

202
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,436
I'm not gonna be here.

203
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,471
What?

204
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,573
Marius is flying me
out to Austria

205
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,642
to hang out at his castle
or whatever that week.

206
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,544
He's co clingy!

207
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,480
You're gonna be
out of town for my birthday?

208
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,615
But at least you can come,
right, Candy?

209
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,518
Sorry, Mabel, my parents
send me to music camp

210
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,653
this time of year.

211
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,489
There is no escape
from music camp.

212
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,625
So neither of you are
gonna be at my birthday party?

213
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,627
And you won't be able
to wish me good-bye

214
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,195
at the end of the summer?

215
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,531
I'm sorry, Mabel.

216
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,466
Summer happens so fast.

217
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,138
Ugh, Marius,
now's not the time!

218
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,441
I think I need to radio
for emotional backup.

219
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,609
Dipper, please come in.

220
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,678
Our party mission is
going down in flames.

221
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,646
Over.

222
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,448
Oh...

223
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,555
This is their
storage facility.

224
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,424
This place would have
been heavily guarded,

225
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,593
but now everything's defunct.

226
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,528
go ahead, flip any switch.

227
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,697
They've all been busted
for millions of years.

228
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,639
Clara, did you eat
my farm?

229
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,710
The glue should
be around here somewhere,

230
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,145
so keep your eyes peeled.

231
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,247
Dipper, let me ask you
something.

232
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,149
Have you thought much
about your future?

233
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,584
No, not really.

234
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,720
I mean, beyond graduating
high school with a high GPA

235
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,588
so I can get accepted
to a good technical college

236
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,223
with a photography
and media production minor

237
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,725
to start my own
ghost hunting show.

238
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,493
Ha ha ha!

239
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,729
It's like talking to
a younger version of myself.

240
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,631
If you're so sure of
what you want out of life, why wait?

241
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,533
Why put up
with the drudgery of school?

242
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,637
Huh, trust me, I'd love
to fast forward the whole thing, but

243
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,672
it's not like I have a choice.

244
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,240
Dipper, I've been thinking.

245
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,642
I'm getting too old
to investigate

246
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,343
Gravity Falls
on my own.

247
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,213
I need to train an apprentice
to help me fight monsters,

248
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,515
solve mysteries,
and protect this town.

249
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,251
And I think I'd like
to keep it in the family.

250
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,719
What are you saying?

251
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,488
I've read your additions
to my journal,

252
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,390
and I'm impressed
with your potential.

253
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,325
What would you say to
staying in Gravity Falls

254
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,661
after the summer ends
and becoming my apprentice?

255
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,462
What about school?

256
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,631
Dipper, I have 12 PhDs.

257
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,801
Your parents would be thrilled
I could give you such an advanced education.

258
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,836
There's also Mabel.

259
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,805
She'd be all alone
in California.

260
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,707
Mabel will be fine
on her own.

261
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,876
She has a magnetic
personality.

262
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:18,743
I watched her
become pen pals

263
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,345
with the pizza
delivery man

264
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,713
in the 60 seconds
he was at the door.

265
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,816
Gosh, we've never really
been apart before.

266
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,618
And isn't it suffocating?

267
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,386
Dipper, can you honestly
tell me

268
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,790
you never felt like you were
meant for something more?

269
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,458
I hav--
I don't know.

270
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,360
Sounds like
a dream come true,

271
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,329
but I'm not sure I have
what it takes.

272
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,497
I was tricked by Bill,

273
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,700
I was wrong about
Stan's portal.

274
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,470
Heck, I can't even operate
this magnet gun right.

275
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,606
Ha! Yes.

276
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,409
Dipper, you found
the adhesive!

277
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,278
- I did?
- Oh-ho, you really did it, kid.

278
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,713
Huddle in, let's get
a picture of this.

279
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,451
Uh, Uncle Ford, you said
everything down here

280
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:00,819
is dead, right?

281
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,255
Yes, unless somehow we
reactivated the...

282
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,790
security system!

283
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,328
What do we do?

284
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,763
Listen to me
very carefully.

285
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,798
I've studied these.
They're security droids,

286
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,266
and they detect
adrenaline.

287
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,269
You simply have to
not feel any fear,

288
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,871
and they won't see you.
- What?

289
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,639
It's okay.
I've done it before.

290
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,775
Just take a deep breath,
focus on your intellect,

291
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,344
and control your fear.

292
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,947
Wh-wh-what?
that's crazy! I--

293
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,981
Follow my lead!

294
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,015
Great Uncle ford...

295
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,584
Focus, Dipper!

296
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,322
I, uh...
I-I-

297
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,358
- I can't!
- Get down!

298
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,336
Aah! No!
Nooooo...

299
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,570
Wait! No!

300
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,039
Stay back!
It's too dangerous!

301
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,908
Sealing the rift is
what's important now.

302
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,343
Take this!

303
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,447
You're gonna have to
do it without me.

304
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,649
Use the adhesive.
Fix the rift!

305
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,818
Save the universe,
Dipper.

306
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,686
Great Uncle Ford!

307
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,891
Hang on,
I'm coming for you.

308
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,896
Don't worry,
I'll get you out of there!

309
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,599
Where's that thing
taking you?

310
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,370
It's an automated
prison droid.

311
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:28,706
And wherever it's going,
I'm not coming back.

312
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,575
What?

313
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,779
No, no, no.

314
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,916
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

315
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,887
Dipper, what on earth
are you doing?

316
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,057
Hold on,
Great Uncle Ford.

317
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,596
I'm getting you out of this
one way or another.

318
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,498
Oh, no!

319
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,670
Come on, come on!

320
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,047
Aah...

321
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,692
Let go of my uncle!

322
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,759
Ohh. Aah!

323
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,700
Aah...

324
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,475
Oh, no. Aah!

325
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,384
Great Uncle Ford!

326
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,654
Okay, let's try magna-pulse.

327
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,543
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no!

328
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,015
Come on, wake up, man.

329
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,183
We gotta get out of here
before--

330
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,957
Hey, I'm warning you!

331
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,125
I have a magnet gun!

332
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,462
Oh, yeah?
You think you can scare me?

333
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,031
Do your worst!

334
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,034
Nothing in this universe is
gonna take away my uncle.

335
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,703
So go ahead,
give me what you got.

336
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,804
I thought I was a goner, kid.

337
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,457
Are you all right?
what happened?

338
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,593
The orb didn't detect
any chemical signs of fear.

339
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,595
It assumed the threat
was neutralized

340
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,164
and then self-disassembled.

341
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,466
- Heh heh heh.
- I-- I did it?

342
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,635
You did it.

343
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,872
This is what I was
talking about.

344
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,641
How many other
12-year-olds

345
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:21,479
do you think are capable
of doing what you've just done?

346
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,522
Hey, everything
all right, pumpkin?

347
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,092
I just can't believe
the summer's almost over.

348
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,729
And now that I know how awful
high school's going to be,

349
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,798
I'm in no hurry
to start that train wreck.

350
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,767
Nobody likes getting older.

351
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,102
But just because
you're growing up

352
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,837
doesn't mean you have
to grow up, you know?

353
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,739
I mean, look at me.
I'm pushing 70,

354
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,607
and I still eat
ice cream for dinner.

355
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,643
But I don't want to say
good-bye to Gravity Falls.

356
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,113
Hey, at least whatever happens
after this summer,

357
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,848
you'll still have your brother
along with you

358
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,982
through thick and thin.

359
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,551
Not everyone can
say that, you know.

360
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,592
Yeah. At least
when I go home

361
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,060
I'll always have Dipper.

362
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,895
Good old reliable old...

363
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,063
<i>Are you okay?</i>

364
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,099
<i>Let's get you out of there.</i>

365
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,869
Listen to me, Dipper,
this town is a magnet

366
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,037
for things
that are special.

367
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,072
And that includes
you and me.

368
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:24,075
It brought both of us here
for a purpose.

369
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,676
Stay here with me, Dipper.

370
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,844
Become my apprentice.

371
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,179
Don't let anyone
hold you--

372
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,085
I'll do it.
I'm gonna stay.

373
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,686
Excellent.

374
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,790
Now, who wants to save
the world, apprentice?

375
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,232
Mabel, I just had
the best day of my life.

376
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,668
UFOs are real, and
there's one under the town,

377
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,870
and I saved
Great Uncle Ford's life and--

378
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,705
Hey, are you okay?

379
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,707
Tell me it's not true,
Dipper.

380
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,875
Tell me you were
joking.

381
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,980
- Ford's apprentice?
- Seriously?

382
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,716
Look, I was thinking,
and this is

383
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,785
a huge opportunity for me.

384
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,955
Well, it's a horrible
opportunity for me!

385
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,257
I had the worst day
of my life.

386
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,760
When we turn 13,
the summer ends,

387
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,662
and I have to leave
everything behind.

388
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,764
You're the only person
I could count on,

389
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,699
and now you're
leaving me, too?

390
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,201
Look, I've been
thinking about it.

391
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,702
I won't be gone
forever, okay?

392
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,104
I'll still
visit you at home

393
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,706
and we'll chat online--
we'll make it work.

394
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,241
I don't want it to work.

395
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,077
I just wish summer
could last forever.

396
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,012
But it can't, Mabel.

397
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,082
Look, things aren't gonna
stay frozen this way.

398
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,750
It's part of growing up.

399
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,152
Things change.

400
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,788
Summer ends.

401
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,922
- Ugh!
- Unh!

402
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,057
Mabel, wait!

403
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,192
I didn't mean it like that.

404
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,961
Mabel, come back!

405
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,007
Only party chocolate
can cheer me up now.

406
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,877
Nerd bucks?
Chewed up pens?

407
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,146
Ugh, wrong backpack.

408
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,947
It's not fair.

409
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,917
I just wish summer
could last forever.

410
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,286
That might be possible.

411
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,756
Sweater Town is not accepting
incoming calls right now.

412
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,158
M-M-Mabel, it's me.

413
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,927
What?
Who said that?

414
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,096
I can help.

415
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,298
The time travel guy?

416
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,866
What are you doing here?

417
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,002
You said you don't want
summer to end, right?

418
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,937
Did I hear that right?

419
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,038
Yeah.

420
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,273
Why are you
asking?

421
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,974
Look, maybe it's
against the rules,

422
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,876
but you once did
a favor for me, so

423
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:39,944
I thought I could
help you out.

424
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,212
It's called a time bubble,

425
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,214
and it prevents time
from going forward.

426
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:46,250
Summer in Gravity Falls can last
as long as you want it to.

427
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:50,121
Really?
But how does it work?

428
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,990
I just need you to get
a little gizmo for me from your uncle.

429
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,259
Something small-- he won't
even know it's missing.

430
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,030
Huh, maybe Dipper has
something like that in his nerd bag.

431
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,134
Let me guess.
Mabel didn't take it well?

432
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,869
I--I don't know.

433
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,837
Maybe I'm making
the wrong decision.

434
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,438
I need to think about this.

435
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:11,375
Dipper, right now we need
to focus on the mission.

436
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,044
Now, come on.
I've got the glue.

437
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,246
Hand me the rift
and let's make history.

438
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,849
What?

439
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,052
Oh, no, the rift!

440
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,288
Huh.
That's odd.

441
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,390
- Is this it?
- Yes, that's it!

442
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,926
Just hand it over and
I'll do my thing.

443
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,862
Unless you're ready
to leave Gravity Falls.

444
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,032
Just a little more summer.

445
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,071
Oops!

446
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,039
What?

447
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,947
Oh, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

448
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,949
Oh...

449
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,388
At last.
At long, long last!

450
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,957
The gate between worlds
is open!

451
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,959
The event one billion
years prophesized

452
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,361
has come to pass!

453
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:07,031
The day has come.
The world is finally mine!

454
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,148
What's going on?

455
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,083
What is that?

456
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,954
We're too late.

457
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,422
It's the end of the world.
