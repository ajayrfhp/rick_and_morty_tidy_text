1
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,208
Preston, I must say,

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,709
the guest list for
this year's party

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,578
has so much diversity.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,848
Yes, a nice mix of
millionaires and billionaires.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,916
Put the oyster fork
at an angle.

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,685
We're not animals, man.

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,253
Now where the devil is...

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,222
Pacifica!

9
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,157
What did I tell you
about that dress?

10
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,027
The theme is sea foam green,
not lake foam green.

11
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,229
- Go change.
- But I kind of like it.

12
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,730
Mind your mother,
Pacifica.

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,265
- But--
- [bell clangs]

14
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,200
Yes, Father.

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,002
[loud rumbling]

16
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,604
[gasping]

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,542
Oh, no, it's...
happening.

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,181
Yes, you are
my possessions.

19
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:52,151
Obey me!
[yells]

20
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,719
This is a disaster.

21
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,721
The party's in
just 24 hours.

22
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,258
Surely there's someone
who could handle this
sort of nonsense.

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,361
And I think I know
just the person.

24
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,116
[man]  <i>You asked for it,</i>
<i>you got it.</i>

25
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,252
<i>An entire 48-hour</i>
<i>marathon of </i> Ghost Harassers.

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,254
<i>on the Used To Be About</i>
<i>History Channel.</i>

27
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,290
Be strong, bladder.

28
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,292
We're not gonna move
till sunset.

29
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:37,296
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you breaking news.</i>

30
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,831
- Oh, what?
- It's starting!

31
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,900
- Turn it up.
- Make room for Grenda.

32
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,137
Tonight's the night, but I've
<i>been out here for days.</i>

33
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,005
<i>The Northwest</i>
<i>family's annual</i>

34
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,109
<i>high-society</i>
<i>shindig ball soiree is here.</i>

35
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,111
<i>And even though common folk</i>
<i>aren't let in,</i>

36
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,879
<i>that won't stop us from</i>
<i>camping out</i>

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,280
<i>for a peek at</i>
<i>the fanciness.</i>

38
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,117
[all] Ooh!

39
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,319
Okay, can someone
please explain

40
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,054
why people care about this?

41
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,989
Um, it's pretty much
the best party of all time.

42
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,358
Rich food, richer boys.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,828
They say each gift basket
has a live quail inside.

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,131
Give me your life, Pacifica.

45
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,700
Guys, in case you've
already forgotten,

46
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,735
Pacifica Northwest
is the worst.

47
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,237
[knocking on door]

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,339
And that's not just
jealousy talking.

49
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,174
I'd say that
to her face.

50
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,308
I need your help.

51
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,310
You're the worst.

52
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,311
[all gasping]

53
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,248
- See?
- [knocking]

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,750
Look, you think
it's easy for me
to come here?

55
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,318
I don't wanna be seen
in this hovel.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,888
But there's something
haunting Northwest Manor.

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,057
If you don't help me,
the party could be ruined.

58
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,859
And why should
I trust you?

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,061
All you've ever done
is try to humiliate
me and Mabel.

60
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,696
Just name
your price, okay?

61
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,231
I'll give you
anything.

62
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,334
Hi, Pacifica.
Excuse us.

63
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,037
Dipper, don't you see
what this means?

64
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,039
If you help Pacifica,
you could get us invites

65
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,675
to the greatest party
of all time.

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,278
What? Mabel, this is
Pacifica we're talking about.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,880
But it's Candy
and Grenda's dream.

68
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,716
[both] Dream!

69
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,452
[sighs] Fine.
I'll bust your ghost.

70
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,789
But, in exchange,
I'll need three
tickets to the party.

71
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,893
[growls]
You're just lucky
I'm desperate.

72
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,397
[all] Whoo! Desperate,
desperate, desperate!

73
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,266
Grenda, get the glue gun.
We're making dresses.

74
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,980
Welcome to Northwest
Manor, dorks.

75
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,149
Try not to touch
anything.

76
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,451
[all exclaiming]

77
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,420
Everything's so fancy.

78
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,455
Fancy floors,
fancy plants.

79
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,325
[gasps]
Fancy man.

80
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,993
Yes. Very good, miss.

81
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,895
The rumors were true.

82
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,834
Ah, if it isn't
the man of the hour.

83
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,370
Hopefully, you can help us
with our little... situation

84
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,107
- before the guests
arrive in an hour.
- I'll do my best.

85
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,311
Splendid. Pacifica,
take our guests to
the problem room,

86
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,247
and, uh... he's not
wearing that, is he?

87
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,182
[teeth squeaking]

88
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,250
I'm on it.

89
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,420
It's like this collar
is strangling me.

90
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,789
Who do you guys think you're
impressing with this stuff?

91
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,025
Um, everyone.

92
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,960
<i>You </i> wouldn't understand.

93
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,196
High standards are what make
the Northwest family great.

94
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,832
Funny, I thought it was
lying about founding the town.

95
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,533
Don't touch that.

96
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,138
Oh, wow, guys,
it's the guest list.

97
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,339
Whoa!

98
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,174
Check out this hottie.

99
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,310
Marius von Fundshauser.

100
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,312
He's a baron
from Austria.

101
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,048
Forget the quail.
I'm putting him in
my guest basket.

102
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,018
Hold up, ladies. I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

103
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,819
but I think this boy
is out of our league.

104
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,888
Grenda's right.
He's a white whale.

105
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,857
Hunting him
will destroy us.

106
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,326
There are tons of
cute boys coming.

107
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:58,297
Let's swear a sisters'
truce not to waste
time on Marius.

108
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,432
Deal.

109
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,433
- Deal.
- Deal.

110
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:05,337
[all laughing]

111
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,473
Whoa.

112
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,880
[Pacifica] This is the main room
where it's been happening.

113
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,281
Yep, this looks like
the kind of room

114
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,516
that would be
haunted, all right.

115
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,284
I wouldn't be worried, though.

116
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,153
Ghosts fall under
a ten-category scale.

117
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,989
Falling plates sound like
a category one.

118
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,358
So what? Are you going
to bore him back into
the afterlife

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,427
by reading from
this book?

120
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,562
Just gotta splash
this sucker with
some anointed water,

121
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,031
and he should be out of
your probably-fake blonde hair.

122
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,566
What was that
about my hair?

123
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,301
Sh. I'm picking
something up.

124
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,181
Come on, stupid thing.
There we go.

125
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,518
- Uh, Pacifica?
- [screams]

126
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,063
Ancient sins.
Ancient sins.

127
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,167
Ancient sins.
Ancient sins.

128
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,336
[chanting continues]

129
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,105
Dipper, what is this?

130
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,407
It's a category ten.

131
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,275
[both screaming]

132
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,414
Ancient blood
and blackened skies.

133
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,017
The forest dark
once more shall rise.

134
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,053
What do we do,
what do we do?

135
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,188
Don't worry.
It can't get
worse than this.

136
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,672
I smell a Northwest.

137
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,277
Come out.

138
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,313
Come out,
wherever you are.

139
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,049
Hurry. Read through
your dumb book already.

140
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,051
I'm looking,
and it's not dumb, okay?

141
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,187
This book is gonna
save our lives.

142
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,622
All right, here we go.
Advice.

143
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,125
Oh, seriously?

144
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,396
You shouldn't
have come here.

145
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,265
This way. Hurry!

146
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,437
Welcome, dukes
and duchesses.

147
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,372
Sultans
and sportsmen.

148
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,140
Yo, what up, Presto?

149
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,610
And reclusive
102-year-old mayor
of Gravity Falls,

150
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,279
Mayor Befufftlefumpter.

151
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,114
[birds cawing]

152
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,949
It's okay.
They're with me.

153
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,385
Tonight, we will enjoy
only the finest of tastes

154
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,720
and only the snootiest
of laughter.

155
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,256
[fawning laughter]

156
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,391
That's the ticket.

157
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,193
Cheese, chocolate.

158
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,261
Cheese, chocolate.

159
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,197
Candy, listen
to me carefully.

160
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,299
You're caught in
a sweet-savory loop.

161
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,034
Put the fondue fork down.

162
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:53,071
- I want to, but I can't.
- [tapping sound]

163
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,274
Introducing
Baron Marius von Fundshauser.

164
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,009
[fanfare plays]

165
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,348
<i>Guten tag.</i>

166
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,317
<i>Guten </i> take me now!

167
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,286
Mabel, we had a truce.

168
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,322
Yes, yes,
yes, a truce.

169
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,158
Grenda, can you go
fetch us some
fancy napkins?

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,126
Wow. Okay.

171
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,562
Listen, Mabel,
I don't know if
I can follow this truce.

172
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,298
- He is too adorable.
- Me, too, Candy.

173
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,101
But what do we do?
He's unattainable.

174
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,437
What if we flirt
with him as a team?

175
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,440
With our cuteness combined,
one of us might have a chance.

176
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,308
It is the perfect plan.

177
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,310
But what about Grenda?

178
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,347
I love Grenda, Mabel,
but these boys are fancy.

179
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,582
Her aggressive flirting
style might scare them away.

180
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,452
Hey, what's on your shirt?

181
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,687
Ha! Gullible!
Loser!

182
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,029
Hurry. Through
the garden.

183
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,364
Watch out for peacocks.

184
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,269
Come on, come on.
I got it.

185
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,305
A haunted painting can only
be trapped in a silver mirror.

186
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,374
Look, there's
a silver mirror right there.

187
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,111
Wait. Don't
go in there.

188
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,213
This room has my parents'
favorite carpet pattern.

189
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,048
They'll lose it if we
track mud in there.

190
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,816
What? Are you serious?

191
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,819
- We'll find another way.
- [ghost wailing]

192
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,355
Pacifica, we don't
have time for this.
Let me through!

193
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,524
No. My parents
will kill me.

194
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,660
Why are you so afraid
of your parents?

195
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,428
You wouldn't
understand.

196
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,671
What is this place?

197
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,407
That's weird. I don't
even know where
this room is.

198
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,342
Hopefully, the ghost
doesn't either.

199
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,344
Yeah. Maybe we're safe.

200
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,684
- Pacifica! Watch out!
- [shrieks]

201
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,320
Your fate is sealed!

202
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,123
A silver mirror.

[ghost growling]

00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:57,796
Prepare to die,
Northwest!

205
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,304
Did you get him?

206
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,842
Oh, free me!

207
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,278
[both]
Yes!

208
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,146
We did it!

209
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,150
[clears throat]

210
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,220
Can I pay you to pretend
that never happened?

211
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,391
Well, Pacifica, you really
found the right man for the job.

212
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,326
We can't
thank you enough.

213
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,362
That's enough.

214
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,697
Hey, just holdin' up
my end of the deal.

215
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,265
Wait. Leaving already?

216
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,668
You're at the world's
best party, dummy.

217
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,269
I'd love to stay,

218
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:42,440
but I've got
a category ten ghost
to dispose of.

219
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,843
Ha ha.
Category ten.

[both laughing]

221
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,413
Call me crazy,

222
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,316
but maybe she's not
that bad after all.

223
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,619
[ghost laughing]

224
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,621
What are you
laughing about, man?
I defeated you.

225
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,390
You've been had, boy.

226
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:03,495
- You remind me of me
150 years ago.
- What do you mean?

227
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,264
<i>One hundred and fifty</i>
<i>years ago this day,</i>

228
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,466
<i>the Northwests asked</i>
<i>us lumber folk</i>

229
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,635
<i>to build them a mansion</i>
<i>atop the hill.</i>

230
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,304
<i>We were told it would be</i>
<i>a service to the town,</i>

231
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,373
<i>that once a year,</i>
<i>they would throw</i>

232
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,344
<i>a grand party, and all</i>
<i>would share in the bounty.</i>

233
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:24,282
It took years of back-breaking
<i>labor and sacrifice,</i>

234
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,518
<i>but when it was time</i>
<i>for the grand party</i>

235

<i>to let us in.</i>

You promised, Northwest.

<i>With the trees gone,</i>
<i>the mudslides began.</i>

<i>While they partied</i>
<i>and laughed,</i>

00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,843
<i>I was swept away</i>
<i>by the storm.</i>

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,315
<i>And so I said</i>
<i>with final breath,</i>

00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,485
<i>150 years I'll return</i>
<i>from death.</i>

So wait a minute.

247
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,400
The Northwests knew
this haunting was coming,

248
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,402
and they tricked me
into helping them

249
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,838
to avoid ghostly justice?
I'll be right back.

250
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,273
Thank you so much
for coming, mayor.

251
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,775
As a sign of our respect,
please take this chimp servant.

252
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,511
Keep him away from
bright lights.

253
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,446
He gets grabby.

[Dipper] Northwests!

255
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,650
You've got
some explaining to do.

256
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,020
Dipper, you came back.

257
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,923
You lied to me.
All of you did.

258
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,259
All you had to do
was let the townsfolk
into the party,

259
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,027
and you could've
broken the curse.

260
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,430
But you made me do
your dirty work instead.

261
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,001
Look at who you're
talking to, boy.

262
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,271
I'm hosting a party for
the most powerful people
in the world.

263
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,507
You think they'd come here
if they had to rub elbows

264
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,343
- with your kind?
- My kind?

265
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,545
I was right about you
all along.

266
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,347
You're just as bad
as your parents.

267
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,482
Another link in
the world's worst chain.

268
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,851
I'm sorry.
They made me.

00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,521
- I should've
told you, but...

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,659
Enjoy the party.
It's the last time
you and your kind

271
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,428
- will ever come.

No, no!
Those aren't for him.

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,801
Stupid Northwests.

get my vengeance on
the Northwests.

278
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,480
You hate them
as much as I.

00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,015
Hey, I feel you.

280
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,616
It's just,
my sister's in there,

281
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,519
and you seem
a little unstable, man.

Very well, boy.

283

Then before you
banish my soul,

may these tired old
lumber eyes

285
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,364
gaze upon the trees
one final time?

286
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,767
Uh... I guess.

287
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,936

Oh, no. Mabel!

00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,929
So, Australia, huh?

294
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,398
Do you guys eat
kangaroo meat over there,

295
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,834
or are they
strictly pets?

296
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,436
I am from Austria.

297
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,438
[nervous laughter]
Tag, tag.

298
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,939
I am Candy.

299
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,008
I love the tiny hats
you wear on your shoulders.

300
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,544
If you were a boat,
do you know what kind you'd be?

301
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,145
A dreamboat.
That's what kind.

302
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,448
- You're tagged out.
- Tagged back in.

303
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,016
- You can't do that.
- I can tag myself.
It's allowed.

304
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,918
[arguing]

305
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,853
[Grenda] Ahem!

306
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,922
What exactly
was all that?

307
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,424
You were flirting with
Marius without me.

308
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,660
We're sorry, Grenda.
It's just...

309
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,397
Your flirting style
can come off as
a bit... intense.

310
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,232
Oh, I see.

311
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,468
You think I shouldn't
be myself

312
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,403
just because I'm in
this stupid mansion.

313
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,571
I thought you liked
my style.

314
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,140
We do, but these boys
might not.

315
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,010
Then I guess they wouldn't
like this either.

316
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,479
- Hey, Marius.
- Yeah?

317
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,549
You've got something
on your shirt.

318
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,054
[both gasping]

319
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,189
[all huffing]

320
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,195
Thank you all for coming.

321
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,764
I think we can all say

322
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,899
this party was
a rousing success.

323
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,101
I guess you could say
it was a slam dunk, Preston.

324
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,903
Yes, yes,
I guess, sure.

325
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,639
A toast...
to our family name.

326
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,541
What?!

327
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,647
Generations locked away.

328
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,817
My revenge
shall have its day.

329
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,619
Oh, the Grim Reaper.

330
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,021
I've been wondering
when you would arrive.

331
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,231
[ferocious growling]

332
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,707
Preston, what are
we going to do?

333
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,109
Prepare the panic room.

334
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,577
[screaming]

335
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,220
Please...
help me.

336
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,889
Whoa! That is messed up.

337
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,492
Just one way
to change your fates.

338
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,496
A Northwest must open
the party gates.

339
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,198
A Northwest?
Pacifica.

340
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,137
Pacifica.
There you are.

341
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,506
The ghost is turning
everyone to wood,

342
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,142
and he just started
rhyming for some reason.

343
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,276
I need your help.

344
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,045
Pacifica?

345
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,047
Wanna know why
this room was locked up?

346
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,149
This is what I found
in here.

347
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,218
A painted record
of every horrible thing

348
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
that my family's
ever done.

349
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,188
Lying, cheating,
and then, there's me.

350
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,059
I lied to you just because
I'm too scared to talk back

351
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,795
to my stupid parents.

352
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,296
You were right about me.

353
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,299
I am just another link
in the world's worst chain.

354
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,137
Pacifica, I'm sorry
about what I said earlier,

355
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,105
but just because you're
your parents' daughter

356
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,573
doesn't mean you have
to be like them.

357
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,109
It's not too late.

358
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,713
- [ghost] It's too late!
- Oh, no!

359
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,149
- You are all wood!
- [screaming]

360
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,992
Dipper, wait.

361
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,295
All right, ghost.

362
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,264
Prepare to get...

363
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,932
No, wait!

364
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,101
No, no, no, no!

365
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,004
No, someone help.
Someone help!

366
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,111
A forest of death,
a lesson learned.

367
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:04,148
And now, the Northwest manor
will burn!

368
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,952
Hey, ugly.

369
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,854
Over here.

370
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,289
You want me to let in
the townsfolk?

371
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,057
'Cause I'll do it.

372
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,292
Just change everyone back.

373
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,028
You wish to prove yourself?

374
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,631
Pull that lever and open
the grand gate to the town.

375
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,634
Fulfill your ancestors'
promise.

376
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,903
Pacifica Elise Northwest,

377
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,972
stop this instant.

378
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,274
We can't let the town
see us like this.

379
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,143
We have a reputation
to uphold.

380
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,145
Now come into
the panic room.

381
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,680
There's enough mini sandwiches
and oxygen

382
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,315
to last you, me,
and a butler for a week.

383
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,884
[whispers]
We'll eat the butler.

384
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,058
- You dare disobey us?
- [bell clangs]

385
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,366
Dingly, dingly.
Is this bell broken?

386
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,301
Our family name
is broken,

387
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,337
- and I'm gonna fix it.
- [gasps]

388
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,809
Get it, get it.

389
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,312
[crowd clamoring]

390
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,815
Yes, yes,
it's happening.

391
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,284
My heart,
once as hard as oak,

392
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,420
now grows soft like more
of a birch or something.

393
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,295
[gasps]

394
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:28,266
Pacifica, you are not like
the other Northwests.

395
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:33,838
I feel lumber justice.

396
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,015
Oh, yes! Yeah!

397
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,717
Good Lord,
the riff-raff.

398
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,252
They're everywhere.

399
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,388
Ooh. Ha ha!

400
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,291
That's not how the fork
should be placed.

401
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,092
Ugh, man,
what happened?

402
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,794
Ahem!

403
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,831
Grenda, we are
so sorry.

404
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,166
We shouldn't have
left you behind.

405
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,367
It's okay.

406
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,903
Maybe I do need
to work on my flirting.

407
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,372
Come on, let's go dunk
our heads into cheese and
chocolate.

408
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,741
- Friends.
- Friends.

409
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,978
Wait! Don't go.

410
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,247
Grenda, was it?
I must speak with you.

411
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,915
There's something
about you.

412
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,383
I can't get you
out of my head.

413
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,319
You're so bold
and confident.

414
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,887
I know you're probably
out of my league,

415
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,956
but might I give you
mein  phone number?

416
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,158
I don't have a phone.

417
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,793
Write it on my face.

418
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,062
Whoa! Go, Grenda.

419
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,331
I guess we shouldn't
have sold her short.

420
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,832
I call bridesmaid.

421
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,300
What? I call
co-bridesmaids.

422
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,369
Man, if your family
hates you for this,

423
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,304
they're idiots.
This is great.

424
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,306
Enjoy it while it lasts.

425
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,942
Next year, I'm sure
they're just gonna
lock everyone out again.

426
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,144
Hey, guess what
we're standing on.

427
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,813
[gasps]

428
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,991
But seriously, I'd better go
find someone to clean this up.

429
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:04,061
Whoo! Scoobiddy doo!
Hornswaggle my goat knees!

430
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,764
Well, ho-ho,
what's up, McGucket?

431
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,002
Dipper, I been
lookin' for you.

432
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,203
I fixed the laptop.

433
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,804
I've been doin' calculations,

434
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,273
and I think
something terrible is comin'.

435
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,208
The apocalypse.
The end times.

436
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,176
[sighs]
You know what, McGucket.

437
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,812
How about we talk about
this stuff tomorrow?

438
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,248
It's a party.
Let's have some fun
for once, huh?

439
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,354
Oh, this is bad.

440
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,023
Somethin's comin'.

441
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,424
Somethin' big.

442
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,029
Quick, in here,
my darling.

443
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,430
A moment alone at last.

444
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,365
You can drop
the act, Trigger.

445
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,537
They're seeing
activity on the machine.

446
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,039
- It's go time.
- Roger that.

447
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,007
Where's my phone?

448
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,443
- I don't have it.
- Yes, you do.
It was in your purse.

449
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,478
So I'm just supposed to
hold onto everything for you?

450
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,981
I asked you when
we were in the car.

451
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,983
Why do we always
have to fight at parties?

452
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,220
Not even gonna ask.
