3
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:12,326
Mabel, do you
believe in ghosts?

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,229
I believe you're
a big dork! Ha ha ha ha!

5
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:16,300
Aaahhh!

6
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:17,539
Soos! Wendy!

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,548
What's up, Mr. Pines?

8
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:23,539
I'm headin' out.
You two are gonna wash
the bathrooms, right?

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,540
- Yes, sir.
- Absolutely not.

10
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:27,553
Ha ha!
You stay outta trouble.

11
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,510
Hey, guys, what's this?

12
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,527
A secret ladder to the roof?

13
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,548
Uh, I don't think
Mr. Pines would like that.

14
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,532
- Uh? - Uh?
- Uh?

15
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,557
You're freakin' me out, dude!

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:40,531
Can we actually go up there?

17
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:43,514
Sure we can.
Roof time! Roof time!

18
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:44,557
Roof time! Roof time!

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,536
Uhh...

20
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,510
All right, check it out.

21
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,532
- Whoa!
- Whoa, cool!

22
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:57,535
Did <i>you </i>put all this
stuff up here?

23
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,783
I may or may not
sneak up here during work,

24
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,771
all the time, every day.

25
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,771
- Yes! - All right.
- Me first!

26
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,779
Jackpot! High five!

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,749
Don't leave me hangin'.

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,766
Ha!

29
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,745
Hey, it's my friends.

30
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,779
Wendy!

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,784
Uh, you guys aren't gonna tell
Stan about this, are you?

32
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:31,784
Later, dorks.

33
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,758
Let's get outta here!

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,770
Whoo!

35
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,745
Later, Wendy!

36
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:44,763
- Ah, good times.
- Uh-oh!

37
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:48,746
- What?
- Somebody's in <i>love!</i>

38
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:49,758
Yeah, right.

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,745
I just think
Wendy's cool, okay?

40
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,746
It's not like
I lay awake at night
thinking about her.

41
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:58,746
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,751
Put on some dance party
for no reason!

44
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:44,781
Go! Go! Go!

45
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,769
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,773
- Dipper!
- What? Yes? Yeah?

47
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,836
Aren't you gonna
get in on this?

48
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,781
I, uh, don't really dance.

49
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:58,743
Yeah, you do.

50
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,755
Mom used to dress him up
in a lamb costume

51
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:01,769
and make him do...

52
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,776
The lamby dance.

53
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:06,747
Now is not
the time to talk
about the lamby dance.

54
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:07,769
Lamb costume? Whoa!

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,767
Is there, like, little ears
and a tail, or...?

56
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:10,836
Well, uh... uh...

57
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:13,835
Dipper would prance around
and sing a song about grazing.

58
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,751
Ha ha!

59
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:17,836
Hey, look at that.

60
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,836
Quittin' time.
The gang's waitin' for me.

61
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:21,835
Hey, wait, uh, maybe I could...

62
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,781
or <i>we </i>could come with you.

63
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,743
Ooh, I don't know.

64
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:27,751
My friends are pretty intense.

65
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:28,836
How old did
you guys say you are?

66
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,835
We're 13, so,
technically a teen.

67
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,743
All right.
I like your moxie, kid.

68
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:35,782
Let me get my stuff.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,776
Since when are we 13?
Is this a leap year?

70
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,840
Come on, Mabel.
This is our chance
to hang out with,

71
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:44,768
you know, the cool kids...
and Wendy and whatever.

72
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,776
I <i>knew </i>it!
You <i>love </i>her!

73
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,835
Love, love, love, love, love!

74
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,751
Oh, hey, what's that?

75
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:51,764
Huh?

76
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,836
Bluh bluh bluh bluh.

77
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:56,776
Hurry up.

78
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,765
- In the belly!
- In the belly!

79
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,866
In the belly!
In the belly!

80
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,884
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Yeah!

81
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:07,891
Wendy!

82
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:09,874
Wendy! Wendy!

83
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,905
Hey, guys, these are
my pals from work,
Mabel and Dipper.

84
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:14,958
I chewed my gum
so it looks like a brain.

85
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,958
She's not much
for first impressions,

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,871
unlike this guy!

87
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,866
This guy...!

88
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:25,866
So are you, like,
babysitting or...?

89
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,870
Come on, Robbie.

90
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:28,900
Guys, this is Lee and Nate...

91
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,962
Unh! Ha ha ha!

92
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,896
- Tambri...
- Ehh.

93
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,891
Thompson, who once ate a run-
over waffle for 50 cents...

94
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,874
Don't tell them that.

95
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,895
And Robbie.
You can probably
figure him out.

96
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:42,866
Yeah, I'm the guy
who spray-painted
the water tower.

97
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:43,892
Oh, you mean the big muffin.

98
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,963
Um, it's a giant explosion.

99
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,959
Heh heh! Kind of <i>does
</i>look like a muffin.

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,899
Let's hurry it up, guys.
I got big plans for
tonight, huh?

101
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
- Let's get outta here!
- Get in the <i>car!</i>

102
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,874
Ow-wow!

103
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,905
Sorry, kid, I'll ride
shotgun, all right?

104
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,883
Okay, just, before we go,

105
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,899
my mom said you guys
aren't allowed to punch
the roof anymore, so...

106
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,962
Thompson! Thompson!
Thompson!

107
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:18,892
Thompson!
Thompson! Thompson!

108
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,958
Ha ha! This is gonna
blow someone's mind.

109
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,870
Mabel, please.

110
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,874
What? Am I embarrassing
you in front of your new...

111
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,884
Girlfriend!

112
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,879
Uhh! Did you just
lick my hand?

113
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,896

- Try murder!
- Some folks died in there.

129
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,899
The place has been
haunted ever since.

130
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,878
This town has such
a colorful history!

What? Are...
are you guys serious?

Yeah. We're all
gonna die!

133
00:06:32,963 --> 00:06:35,959
Chill out, man.
It's not as bad
as it looks.

134
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,888
Come on, Dipper.

135
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:41,904
Okay.

136
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,874
Just... just
gotta get a foothold.

137
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,963
Dude, your <i>sister </i>did it.

Just... there you go.

00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,895
Sorry, dude.

141
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,963
Good job
throwing the kid
off the fence, genius.

142
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,884
Your <i>mom's </i>a genius.

143
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,891
Ho ho ho!
This place is amazing.

144
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:04,883
I think it's...
it's stuck.

145
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,871
- Let me take a crack at it.
- Oh, yeah.

146
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,878
I can't get in,
but I'm sure junior here

is gonna break it down
like Hercules.

148
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,884
Come on, leave him alone.
He's just a little kid.

149
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:24,963
Whoa, kid!
What are you doing?

150
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,891
Go, Dipper!
Punch that metal thing!

151
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:34,899
Hey, Dipper, take it easy.

152
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,963
Who wants to bet
he doesn't make it?

153
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,899
Good call,
inviting this
little maniac!

154

Your new name

All right.

156
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,883
Cool.
Yeah, man.

157
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:50,892
Nice work.

158
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,891
Do you guys really
think it's haunted?

159
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,888
Nah! Thompson,
are you kidding me?

160
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,871
Come on, shut up,
man! Ha ha ha!

161
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,163
Whoa! No way!

162
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:10,785
Oh, man.

163
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:13,748
It's even creepier
than I imagined.

164
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:21,765
Yep, it's dust.

165
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,786
Hey, dude, where
do you think they
keep the dead bodies?

166
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,752
Shut up, man!

167
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,786
Guys, check it out!
You think they still work?

168
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,768
Nice!

169
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:41,781
Jackpot!

170
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,764
So, what are we gonna do now?

171
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:44,777
Anything we want.

172
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:50,786
Take that.

173
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,761
Ha ha ha! Ohh!

174
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,748
Put 'em in, put 'em in!
Three at a time,
three at a time!

175
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,752
Oh, my gosh!
Smile dip!

176
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:09,768
I thought this stuff
was banned in America.

177
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:10,786
Maybe they had a good reason.

178
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:13,748
- Oomph!
- Ha ha ha!

179
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,759
Hey, come here,
man, we got it ready!

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,777
Whatever it is, I'll do it!

181
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:23,752
Ha ha ha! Thompson!

182
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,744
Dipper, this night
is, like, legendary.

183
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,777
- Really?
- Just look around. The guys are bonding.

184
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:33,747
I've never even seen
tambri look up from
her phone this long,

185
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:35,769
and your sister
seems to be going nuts
for that smile dip.

186
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,781
Uhh.

187
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,776
Maybe I've had too much.

188
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,769
What do <i>you </i>think?

189
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:47,760
Would you like
to eat my candy paws?

190
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,773
Of course, you little angel.

191
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,743
You know, Dipper, I wasn't sure

192
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:58,782
if you could hang
with our crew at first,

193
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,785
but you're surprisingly
mature for your age.

194
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,773
Yes. Yes, I am.

195
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,785
Hey, guys, we need more ice.

196
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,748
I'm on it.

197
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,760
What was that?

198
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,776
I thought I heard some
lady screaming back here.

199
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:37,743
You freakin' out, kid?

200
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,785
No. No, I'm cool.
Everything's cool.

201
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,764
Then what's all this about?

202
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,752
Oh, that's...
Uh... uh... uh...

203
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:44,768
Hey, look!

204
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,743
<i>Dancy Pants Revolution,</i>

205
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:47,786
the game that tricks
people into exercising.

206
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,752
All right, I'm down.

207
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,772
Yeah, let's all...
let's all go play that.

208
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:52,777
Hm.

209
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,752
<i>Dance! Hurry up!</i>

210
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,743
Go! Go! Go! Go!

211
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,756
Wow! He's really
terrible at this.

212
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:05,769
Yeah, yeah, that's...
that's great.

213
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,761
I'll be right back.

214
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,756
Come on,
Grunkle Stan,
pick up!

215
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,752
Uhh! What is he doing?

216
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:23,768
<i>I don't care about
Dukes or commoners...</i>

217
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,756
<i>Or his royal highness,
Lionel of Cornwall.</i>

218
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,748
<i>I'm not afraid anymore, mother.</i>

219
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:30,764
<i>Duchess, I forbid you.</i>

220
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:35,756
<i>I may be a duchess,
but I'm also a woman!</i>

221
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:36,789
Yes! Yes!

222
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,785
In your face, Elizabeth!

223
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:41,764
It's just like my life!

224
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:42,790
In a way.

225
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,747
Mabel, I need your advice.

226
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,775
We're hanging out
in a haunted
convenience store,

227
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,763
I can't get ahold
of Grunkle Stan,

228
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:50,780
and if I try to say
anything about it

229
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,748
to any of these guys,
they'll just think

230
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,748
I'm a scared little kid
or something.

231
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,776
Mabel?

232
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,785
The future is in the past!

233
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,790
Onward, deoshebah!

234
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,785
Mabel! How many
of these did you eat?

235
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:12,743
Eleventeen.

236
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:14,765
Oh, man.
Oh man, oh man, oh man!

237
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:24,756
Whoa, guys,
you might wanna see this.

238
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:26,772
What the heck?

239
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,760
Whoa. Then the rumors
<i>are </i>true.

240
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,764
Dude, dare you
to lie down in it.

241
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,781
Good idea.
Go lie down in it.

242
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:37,743
I'm a dead body! Look!

243
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:38,760
Wait!

244
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,747
Maybe let's <i>not </i>do that.

245
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:41,777
This guy's <i>scared!</i>

246
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:44,743
All I'm saying is,
why tempt the fates?

247
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,756
I mean, what if
this place really is...

248
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,744
Haunted?

249
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,764
Just take it down
a notch, captain buzzkill.

250
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:56,764
But I thought
I was Dr. Fun Times.

251
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:00,756
Well, you're acting like
Captain Buzzkill, right?

252
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:02,772
Yeah. Little bit.

253
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,218
Status update:

254
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,702
Trapped in store
with insane 9-year-old.

255
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,354
I'm not a 9-year-old.
I'm 13,

256
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,387
technically a teen!

257
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:15,379
Whoa? What is that?

258
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:25,358
Whoa!

259
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,370
What?

260
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,354
"Status update...

261
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,350
Aaaahhhhhhh."

262
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:35,370
Aaahhh!

263
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:39,405
- Aaahhh!
- Aaahhh!

264
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,395
Aaahhh!

265
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,378
Tambri! Tambri!

266
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,367
Can you hear us?

267
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,384
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know, man! I don't know!

268
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:50,400
Let's just go already!

269
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,392
- Thompson!
- Wait!

270
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:55,408
I've almost got the high score!

271
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,408
Aah! Aaahhh!

272
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:59,387
Huh? What?

273
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,404
<i>Time to shake what
your momma gave you!</i>

274
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:05,374
Oh, no! Help!
So many arrows!

275
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,405
<i>You're a dance machine!</i>

276
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:08,405
No, <i>you're </i>a dance machine!

277
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,375
- Oh, no!
- Thompson!

278
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,317
Forget him!
Let's go!

279
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,320
What the...?
Guys, it's locked!

280
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,375
Outta my way!

281
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,412
Aah!

282
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,378
Aaahhh!

283
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,405
Everybody, wait.

284
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,387
Whatever is doing this
has to have some kind
of reason.

285
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,387
Maybe if we could just
figure out what it is,

286
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:30,405
then they'll
let us out of here.

287
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,320
"They'll let
us out of here."

288
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,386
Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

289
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,379
I don't know, guys.
Maybe he's got a point.

290
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,399
Yeah, right.

291
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,316
I'm sure the ghost
just wants to talk
about his feelings!

292
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,395
Aah! Aah!
Aaahhh!

293
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:44,320
Wh-what?

294
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,404
I'm bonkers for
eating you alive!

295
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,412
No!

296
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,374
Aaahhh!

297
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,378
Lee!

298
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,391
Okay, okay.

299
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:55,404
I'm with you, kid.
One hundred percent, man.

300
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,395
Welcome!

301
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,404
They got Mabel!

302
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:02,378
Welcome to your graves,
young trespassers!

303
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,404
Ha ha ha!

304
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:06,374
We're super sorry
for hanging out
in your store.

305
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,399
Yeah, can we just
go now and leave forever?

306
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,396
Well... okay.
You're free to go.

307
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,408
But before you leave,
hot dogs are now half off.

308
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:19,405
I know it might
be crazy, but you
gotta try these dogs!

309
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,409
Just kidding
about the hot dog sale!

310
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,374
Just let us outta here already!

311
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,317
I don't like your tone!

312
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,388
No, no! Aah!

313
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:37,408
What? No!
I'm a hot dog!

314
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,375
It begins!

315
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,166
Whoa!

316
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,141
Unh!

317
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,162
Ohh!

318
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,656
Aah!

319
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,665
Welcome to your home
for all eternity!

320
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,632
- Dipper, what do we do?
- Duck!

321
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,742
Quick, in there!

322
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,737
What do they want from us?

323
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,754
- Revenge, I guess...?
- What did we do wrong?

324
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:09,758
Okay, let's
try to figure out
the pattern here.

325
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,732
Why was each person taken?

326
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,754
Tambri was texting,
Thompson was playing
a video game,

327
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:16,745
Lee was being sarcastic...
it doesn't make any sense!

328
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:19,767
Yeah. I mean,
those are all just
normal teenage things.

329
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,728
Wendy, say that
last part again.

330
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:24,761
"Normal teenage things"?

331
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:26,754
Of course! Stay here
until I get back.

332
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,729
Dude, what are you doing?

333
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,201
Hey, ghost!

334
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,192
I've got something to tell you.

335
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,184
I'm not a teenager!

336
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,183
Ho ho ho!

337
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:51,204
Well, why didn't you say so?

338
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:53,175
Waaahh!

339
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,175
Ugh.

340
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:56,166
How old did you say you were?

341
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,191
I'm...

342
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:01,191
I'm 12, technically not a teen.

343
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:05,108
When we were alive,
teenagers were a scourge
on our store.

344
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,108
Always sassafrassin' customers

345
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,192
with their boomie-boxes

346
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,108
and disrespectful short pants,

347
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:14,112
so we decided
to up and ban them,

348
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:18,191
but they retaliated
with this newfangled
rap music!

349
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:21,183
<i>The lyrics,
they were so... hateful!</i>

350
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,109
<i>♪ Homework's wack,
and so are rules ♪</i>

351
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,179
<i>♪ tuckin' in
your shirt's for fools ♪</i>

352
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,471
Nooo!

353
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:28,480
<i>It was so shocking,
we were stricken down</i>

354
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,464
<i>with double heart attacks.</i>

355
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,484
That's why we hate
teenagers so much,

356
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,450
don't we, honey?

357
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,472
But they're my friends.

358
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:43,388
Isn't there anything
I can do to help them?

359
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,485
There <i>is </i>one thing.

360
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:48,392
Do you know any
funny little dances?

361
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:51,392
Uh... is there
anything else I can do?

362
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,455
Nooooo!

363
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:56,459
Okay, okay, okay!
Um, well...

364
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,484
I do know...
The lamby-lamby dance,

365
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:04,464
but, uh, but I can't
really do it without
a lamb costume.

366
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:09,450
Oh. Well. There it is.

367
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,484

00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,225
Your friends are free.

378
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:44,196
Well, I don't think
you have to worry about
us comin' back, so...

379
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,209
Ohh!

380
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,801
I'm never gonna eat
or <i>do </i>anything ever again.

381
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,112
- Hey, there's still some left.
- Evil!

382
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:03,198
What... what happened after
everything went crazy?

383
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,189
You are not
going to believe it.

384
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,190
The ghosts appeared,
and Dipper had to...

385
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,223
Uh... ahem...

386
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:13,131
And, um, Dipper
just grabbed a bat

387
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,203
and started
beating ghosts down,
left and right.

388
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,214
And then the ghosts
got all scared

389
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:20,131
and ran away like
a couple of little girls.

390
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,194
- It was insane!
- No way!

391
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:24,199
Dr. fun Times!

392
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:30,227
Well, I'm probably
scarred for life.

393
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:33,189
Yeah, that was pretty crazy.

394
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,189
Think I'm gonna go
stare at a wall for a while
and rethink everything.

395
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,213
Hey, next time we hang out,

396
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,211
let's stay at
the mystery shack, okay?

397
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,227
Ha ha! Next time?

398
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:44,202
Yeah, let's...
let's hang out
at the shack.

399
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,135
Ha ha! Yeah.

400
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,190
Next time.

401
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,219
Ohh!

402
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,215
What kind of sick joke is this?

403
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,199
Ah, the wedding.

404
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,202
I've waited so long for this.

405
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,136
Oh, look at her in that dress.

406
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,219
Count Lionel!
What's <i>he </i>doin' here?!

407
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,211
<i>I've come to reclaim my bride!</i>

408
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,135
You had your chance
at the cotillion, you!

409
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:18,197
<i>You had your chance
at the cotillion, you!</i>

410
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,220
That's what I'm sayin'!

411
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,202
Uh...

412
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:28,144
Couldn't find the remote.

413
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,815
