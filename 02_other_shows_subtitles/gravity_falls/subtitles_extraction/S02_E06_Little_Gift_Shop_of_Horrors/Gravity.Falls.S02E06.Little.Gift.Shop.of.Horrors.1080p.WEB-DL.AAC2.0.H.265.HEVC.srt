1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,905
( lightning crashing )

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:14,179
( footsteps approaching )

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,215
Well, hello there,
traveler.

4
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,551
I see your car broke down
on this lonesome country road,

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,287
a place so remote that no one
can hear your screams!

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,622
( footsteps retreating )

7
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,090
Pretend I didn't say that.

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,092
Come in, come in,
but be warned,

9
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:31,096
if you enter you may be
subjected to my tales.

10
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,700
Tales designed
to sell my merchandise!

11
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,770
( evil laughter )

12
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,106
Sorry, I was thinking

13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,775
of something funny
I heard earlier.

14
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,052
You've come to
the Mystery Shack after-hours,

15
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,054
a time when only
our creepiest

16
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,290
and most cursed objects
are for sale,

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,192
like that thing there!

18
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,626
( thunder cracking )

19
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,727
No, not a fan?

20
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,362
Too many orifices?

21
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,765
All right, I can tell
what you're looking for

22
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,934
is this disembodied hand.

23
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,635
Why is it so expensive?

24
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,938
Well, that's quite a tale

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,308
and it's called Hands Off!

26
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,610
No, seriously, hands off,
that's not for sale.

27
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,678
All right.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,346
Hands Off!

29
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,687
Swap meet!
Swap meet! Swap meet!

30
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,689
Look at all these
priceless treasures.

31
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,358
Bobbly-heads!

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,327
They agree with
everything I say.

33
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,995
Professor glasses!

34
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,697
They make me look
like a genius.

35
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,699
( groans )

36
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,834
Look at these
faux-gold beauties.

37
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,903
They're mob-boss quality.

38
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,974
All right, kids,

39
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:25,277
prepare to watch
the delicate art of the deal.

40
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,645
Hey, hag-face!

41
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,747
How much
for the junk watches?

42
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,749
They are not for sale.

43
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,752
Not for you,
Stan Pines!

44
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,354
The wind
whispers your name!

45
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,255
( wind blowing )

46
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,990
( chimes tinkling )

47
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,159
Shh...
Shush, you guys.

48
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,860
All right, I get it,
you're creepy.

49
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,263
Anyway, less talky,
more watchy!

50
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,966
Get your hands
off my watch!

51
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,268
Ugh!

52
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,103
Yeesh!
Freak show.

53
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:54,139
Wow, someone needs to work
on their social skills.

54
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,340
And their observation skills.

55
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,942
Boom!

56
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,444
Good job, heisting hands.
Mwah, mwah.

57
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,848
Grunkle Stan, are you seriously
shoplifting from a witch?

58
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,283
That sounded
like a curse.

59
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,118
"That sounded
like a curse!"

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,086
Hey, anyone want
to buy a wet blanket?

61
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,788
We got a wet blanket
for sale!

62
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,390
( laughter )

63
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:15,460
I can't survive
in this market.

64
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,163
( alarm beeping )

65
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,398
Ha, curse.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,432
Yeah, right.

67
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,201
Ah!

68
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,103
Wait, is this curse ugly
or normal ugly?

69
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,773
Looks like
I got off scot-free.

70
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,244
( screaming )

71
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,845
All right, kiddos,
breakfast time.

72
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,080
Prepare your mouths for--

73
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,381
( Waddles oinking )

74
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,850
Whoa! Whoa-ah!
No hands!

75
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,420
Grunkle Stan,
what happened to your hands?

76
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,488
So I might have
got cursed a little,

77
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,257
but the watch
looks nice, right?

78
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,362
Foolish man, thieving hands
find wicked face!

79
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,332
You must return
what isn't yours...

80
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,366
That's better.

81
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,335
I told you,
Grunkle Stan,

82
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,337
you got to give that
watch back and apologize.

83
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,471
What?

84
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,573
That old crone
should apologize to me

85
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,109
for denying my right
to buy cheap junk.

86
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,478
I don't need hands,
I've got self respect.

87
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,086
Mabel, sweetie, will you
make your uncle some hands?

88
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,854
La-la-la.

89
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,123
Hands makeover!

90
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,292
Say hello
to your "new hands"!

91
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,293
In quotes.

92
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,427
Nice work, kid.

93
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,429
See, hands are overrated.

94
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,465
I'm ready
to take on the day!

95
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,001
Ma'am.

96
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,402
( screams )

97
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,508
( groans )

98
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,412
Hey, Mr. Pines.

99
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,849
Should we play toss me
a dozen eggs like we always do?

100
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,151
No, Jimmy, wait!
Not today!

101
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,220
Not today!

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,224
Let's find that witch.

103
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,295
MABEL: According
to the swap meet pamphlet,

104
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,163
the hand witch lives
in a horrible hand witch lair

105
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,264
on Hand Witch Mountain.

106
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,266
STAN: Stop saying hand witch!

107
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,105
Grunkle Stan, did you
just tap my shoulder?

108
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,373
Kid, I can't
tap anything.

109
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,111
Guys, can you stop tapping
both my shoulders?

110
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,480
( hands tapping )

111
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,118
( screaming )

112
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,423
Hands!
Lots of hands!

113
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,359
Ah!

114
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,000
Ah!

115
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,401
( screaming )

116
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,438
( evil laughter )

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,107
Look at this touching scene.

118
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,542
Up top!

119
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,444
You guys,
you guys get me.

120
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,412
All right, you horrible wench,
you got me.

121
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,314
Stealing is wrong,
etcetera, take it.

122
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,350
Now can I have
my hands back?

123
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,019
I have a certain gesture
I'd like to share with you.

124
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,223
Alas, your hands cannot
be gotten so easily.

125
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,426
The spirits say, um...

126
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:06,064
that the curse can
only be broken by a kiss!

127
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,432
ALL: What?

128
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,368
It's all right, kids.

129
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,002
Just look away.

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,441
A kiss on the lips!

131
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,444
What? Forget it! I'm not
kissing any of that mess.

132
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,079
I don't need
my hands that bad.

133
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,948
Yeah, you're just
making stuff up now.

134
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,182
Let's go, kids.

135
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,151
No, wait!
Don't go!

136
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,619
You're right,
you're right.

137
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,322
I was just making
all that stuff up.

138
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,958
Just trying to get
something going, you know.

139
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
So hard to meet
people these days.

140
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,428
( snaps fingers )

141
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,964
So this was all just
a ploy to get a date?

142
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,365
I'm desperate, okay?

143
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,367
But every time I bring
someone back here

144
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,071
without keeping their hands
hostage, they just run away!

145
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,939
Well, yeah, look
at this horror show.

146
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,608
It's creepy
even for a cave!

147
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,443
You just need
to redecorate.

148
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,378
For example...

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,547
A handelabra!

150
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,317
Ooh,
the hand witch likes.

151
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,652
Then watch me work.

152
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,922
Home makeover!

153
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,093
Redecorate.

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,396
Redo you.

155
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,333
Change it around.

156
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,270
You got to do it
to make it work.

157
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,508
Okay. Time to take a look
at your fantastic new cave.

158
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,510
( gasps )

159
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,146
MABEL: Men will definitely
tolerate you now.

160
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,016
And I left a book of pickup
lines on the end table.

161
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,218
Blah!
Oh, my goodness!

162
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,086
I can't believe
this is the same cave!

163
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,354
Oh, my goodness!

164
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,390
I just can't
find the words.

165
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,392
How about "Here's
your hands back"?

166
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,560
Oh, right.

167
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,328

168
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,097

169
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,167
Shaky, Scratchy.

170
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,036
I've missed you
old rascals.

171
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,537
You're all right,
sister.

172
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,041
Will you be
my boyfriend now?

173
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,342
No, never.

174
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,311
Well,
I learned nothing.

175
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,714
Back to my crippling
loneliness.

176
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,383
Hey, I'm lost
in these mountains.

177
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,452
Could I crash here
for the night?

178
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,288
Please, come in. Uh...

179
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,290

180
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,459
"Girl, are those space pants?

181
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,562
Because your butt looks
out of this world."

182
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,431
Wow.
Thanks for noticing.

183
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,532
Yes!

184
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,735
All right, I get it.

185
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,404
You don't want the hand,
you're a savvy customer.

186
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,508
But perhaps you'd be
interested in buying, um...

187
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,245
this magic pig.

188
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,779
Sure he doesn't look magic,

189
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,249
but there
is a very interesting story

190
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,483
I'm about
to make up about him,

191
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,319

Abaconings!

192

"The What-The-Heck-A-Hedron!

194

195
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,666
Whoa. That's false advertising
I can get behind.

This is May May and The Hogg
coming at you on the AM.

Whoa!

204
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,615
Not sure we can say
that on the air.

205
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,384
Don't touch
that dial, truckers,

206
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,052
'cause The Hogg
just ate it.

207
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,387
( honking, farts )

208
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,222
Mabel,
could you knock it off?

209
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,224
I'm trying to solve
this intelligence puzzle,

210
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,458
but it seems impossible.

211
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,660
( buzzing )

212
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,062
Maybe you're just
not smart enough.

213
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,432
We'll see about that.

214
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,406
Buried near the falls is
the legendary percepshroom.

215
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,174
To increase brain power,
grind it up

216
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,676
and apply to
the forehead overnight.

217
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,680
Tomorrow, I own you!

218

I feel smarter already.

223

Waddles, what happened to you?

231
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,366
Have you been possessed

This isn't right!

237
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,415
The pig goes oink.
The pig goes oink!

238

241
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,723
How did you do that?

242
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,426
<i>I can teach you, Dipper.</i>
<i>I can teach you many things.</i>

Yeah,

Dude, that rocket cart

251
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,515
You and me
should go invent stuff.

252
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,317
Uh, Waddles,
don't you want to stay up here

253
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,486
and record some
morning pranks with me?

254
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,455
Mabel,
this pig's got a gift.

255
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,589
He needs to share it
with the world.

<i>I'm sorry, Mabel.</i>

I hate everything!

I bet we could be

267
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,249
Ah! An affront
against nature!

268
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,584
<i>Ha! Forget kites.</i>

269

<i>not a prize</i>
<i>to hold in your hand.</i>

326
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,135
<i>Also I miss getting</i>
<i>my tummy tickled.</i>

327
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,538
( oinking )

328
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,640
Oh, Waddles.

329
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,709
( electrical crackling )

330
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,647
No!
Our invention!

331
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,483
I know what will make you
feel better.

332
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,952
A simple hug
from a simple pig.

333
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,455
Yeah, guess so.

334
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,491
( laughs )

335
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,428
Good pig. Ugh.

336
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,999
You know what? You're right.
Don't buy the pig.

337
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,834
In fact I'm better off
leaving it with my niece.

338
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,102
( arrow twanging )

339
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,004
No shooting in the house,
sweetie.

340
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,574
But perhaps I could interest you
in something else.

341
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,577
Like these
spooky movies!

342
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,878
Movies are great.

343
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,014
You watch the movie,
you scare the girl,

344
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,515
the girl snuggles up
next to you.

345
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,117
Next thing you know,
you got to raise a kid,

346
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,585
your life falls apart.

347
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,753
Forget that last part.

348
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,689
This next tale is called
Clay Day!

349
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,995
GIRL: ( on TV ) <i>You did it,</i>
<i>Shimmery Twinkleheart!</i>

350
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,730
<i>No, you did it,</i>
<i>Cinnamon.</i>

351
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,833
<i>Because you believed</i>
<i>in yourself.</i>

352
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,735
Everything
about this is bad.

353
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,170
Well, that just
put me 90 minutes

354
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,538
closer to death.

355
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,739
It's time you kids
learn to watch

356
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,874
the classics from my day.

357
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,009
Ooh, old people movies.

358
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,445
Get ready for references
we don't understand

359
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,579
and words
we can't repeat.

360
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,086
<i>You're no match</i>
<i>for Loinclothiclese.</i>

361
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,121
<i>I've come</i>
<i>for the golden pants.</i>

362
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,090
( roars )

363
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,191
( screaming )

364
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,027
Oh, no! Mabel!

365
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,595
Well,
your sister is broken.

366
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,098
Oh, Grunkle Stan,
I should have told you before

367
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,033
that Mabel
has a childhood terror

368
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,202
of old-timey stop-motion
animation.

369
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,838
It's like her number one fear
since we were kids.

370
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,507
( chuckles ) Come on,
those hokey old things,

371
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,009
how scared could she be?

372
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:23,081
The Cyclops! His face
is made of nightmares!

373
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,183
Kid, it's just a movie.
It can't hurt you.

374
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,184
No talking.

375
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,218
They wait for you to talk

376
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,587
and then crawl
inside your mouth!

377
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,589
Why did you have
to show her that tape?

378
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,491
There's got to be a way
to get her over this!

379
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,996
Huh...

380
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,801
All right, if we can just
get the director to show her

381
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,104
the models are fake,
maybe she'll finally calm down.

382
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,105
I don't know, dude.

383
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,272
According to the internet,

384
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,607
special effects genius
Harry Claymore

385
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,042
is some kind of recluse.

386
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,911
Man wants his privacy.
I can respect that.

387
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,516
Well, everyone
over the fence.

388
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,252
You see, Mabel, those monsters
are just tiny clay figures

389
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,589
moved around one frame at
a time by an antisocial shut-in.

390
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,824
Those people
are called animators.

391
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,694
Hello?
( echoes )

392
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,030
Mr. Claymore?

393
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,898
We want to get a look
at your figurines.

394
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,733
We're not paparazzi.

395
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,202
Aha!

396
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,905
See, Mabel, it's all just
special effects.

397
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,106
You can come out.

398
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,174
MABEL: No!

399
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,175
Kid, listen to me.

400
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,576
For the last time,

401
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,246
there is nothing here
to be afraid of--

402
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,916
( roars )

403
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,584
( screaming )

404
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,652
( groans )

405
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,655
It's slowly...

406
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,224
swiping at us!

407
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,860
Let's escape by
standing still!

408
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,163
Oh, it didn't work!

409
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,832
( screaming )

410
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,602
Whoa!

411
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,037
( screams )

412
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,038
( roars )

413
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
( screaming )

414
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,642
( groans )

415
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,247
How is this happening?
What do they want?

416
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,616
HARRY: I'm afraid
they want you.

417
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,188
Harry Claymore,
master of special effects,

418
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,190
circa 1970 something.

419
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,960
Alas, my effects
are more special than you know.

420
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,728
What? But how are
these things real?

421
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,729
What about stop motion?

422
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,931
What?

423
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,165
Do you really
believe someone

424
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,134
moves these figures
one frame at a time?

425
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,802
I'm not a masochist.

426
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,605
I used black magic to make them
animate themselves.

427
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,874
It was great at first,
but one day...

428
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,180
No!

429
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,282
Where's the heart?!

430
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,251
<i>HARRY: Now that they were</i>
<i>out of work,</i>

431
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,621
<i>they went mad</i>
<i>and enslaved me!</i>

432
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,958
And now they will turn you
into unholy beasts of clay

433
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,693
to join in their mischief!

434
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,128
Well, Mr. Pines,
at least you'll finally

435
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,963
get to work with
your favorite director.

436
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,932
And by work, I mean, suffocate
inside a big wad of clay.

437
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,235
DIPPER: Help!

438
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,336
Somebody help us!

439
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,270
Help!

440
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,838
Oh, what do I do?

441
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,774
How can I defeat
those monstrosities?

442
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,181
Hey, I changed it into
something I like.

443
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,251
Whoa.
I think I have an idea!

444
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,354
Hey, one-eyed-clops!

445
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,322
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
dum-dum!

446
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,690
Come at me!

447
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,892
( yells )

448
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,433
Ah!

449
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,836
Wipe that face off
your face.

450
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,207
Oh, I've got big plans for you!

451
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,009
Hey, skeleton dorks!

452
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,678
It's "clayback" time!

453
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,446
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

454
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,050
Dude, you conquered
your fear.

455
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,353
That's right. Because
she believed in herself.

456
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,922
Can it, Twinkleheart!

457
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,257
Just start pounding
those skeletons!

458
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,395
Mabel, you did it.

459
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,896
So you're not scared
anymore?

460
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,932
Oh, I'm scared
twice as much now,

461
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,334
but now I know
it's rational.

462
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,070
Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you.
You were right.

463
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,206
Stop motion is
pure evil.

464
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,274
And probably
really expensive.

465
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,143
Incredibly expensive.

466
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,346
This is an impressive
fight though.

467
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,281
I'm glad
I'm facing towards it.

468
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,184
ALL: Yay!

469
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,385
That was the best part.

470
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,029
Well, I think today we learned
that you can remold your fears.

471
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,465
I'm just glad none of us
got turned into clay.

472
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,837
Who wants to see me
change into most anything?

473
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,406
( humming )

474
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,408
I can walk
through walls.

475
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,010
Whoa!

476
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,846
We're safe now, kids.

477
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,448
We're safe.

478
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,049
I don't get it.

479
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,951
You don't want the pig,
you don't want my tapes,

480
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,853
what are you gonna buy?

481
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,356
How about this
delicious potion?

482
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,324
Here, have
a free sample.

483
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,892
( glugging )

484
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,365
( thud )

485
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,833
STAN: You should
have bought my merch

486
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,002
when you had the chance,
buddy.

487
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,770
But that's okay.

488
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,306
I'll have something new
for sale very soon.

489
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,174
( chuckling )

490
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,279
And here we have
our latest attraction.

491
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,447
The legendary
Cheapskate!

492
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,416
I saw it blinking.

493
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,318
Just an optical illusion.

494
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,020
Come along, everyone.

495
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,088
Step right up! ( laughs )

496
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,294
That's right,
I'm a jerk.

497
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,362
Hey, want to play
tic-tac-toe?

498
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,268
Hey, I wanted to be Xs,
let me be Xs.

499
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,137
Trust me,
just let her be Xs.

500
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,438
( sighs )

501
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,573
Yay!

502
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,410
Actually I'm sorry.
I changed my mind, I'll be Os.

503
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,446
Okay, you're gonna
hate me right now,

504
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,848
but is Xs still
a possibility?

505
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,321
I don't think
you're playing this right.
