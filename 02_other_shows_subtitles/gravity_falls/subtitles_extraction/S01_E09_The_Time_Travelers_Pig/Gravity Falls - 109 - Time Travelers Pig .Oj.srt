1
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:11,538
There she is, Mabel--

2
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,474
The cheapest fair money can rent!

3
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:16,310
I spared every expense!

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,315
I think the sky tram is broken.

5
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:23,070
Also most of my bones.

6
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:24,551
This guy!

7
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:25,619
All right, all right.

8
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,388
I got a job for you two.

9
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,391
I printed up a bunch of fake safety inspection certificates.

10
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:32,626
Go slap one on anything that looks like a lawsuit.

11
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,461
Grunkle stan, is that legal?

12
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,464
When there's no cops around, anything's legal!

13
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,633
Soos, how's that dunk tank coming along?

14
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,703
Almost ready to go, Mr. Pines.

15
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,475
Ha! You got it rigged from here to timbuktu!

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,312
There's nothin' on earth that could knock me down!

17
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,481
Yeah, except for like a futuristic laser arm cannon.

18
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,484
hey, you haven't seen my red screwdriver, have ya?

19
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,652
Darn thing went missing.

20
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:01,655
Maybe some magical creature or paranormal thing took it.

21
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,491
Oy, you been spendin' too much time with those kids!

22
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:07,461
All right, let's see. Where did I put that thing?

23
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:12,299
This mission is proceeding as planned. Over.

24
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:59,920
It's 12:00! The dunk tank is now open!

25
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,584
Step right up and dunk me, folks!

26
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,785
I'm talkin' to you, cut-offs!

27
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,687
That's right! Muffin top! High pants!

28
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,455
Who wants a piece of me?!

29
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,694
Come back any time, folks!

30
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,697
How do they get them into this shape?

31
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,365
It's unnatural.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,635
But, Dipper, they're so... Delicious?

33
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:24,638
Uh, boo!

34
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:25,639
I'll be right back.

35
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:28,342
I'll be right here!

36
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,510
I love you.

37
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:32,679
Look at you two, gettin' all romantic at the fair.

38
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,648
Come on, it's no big deal.

39
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,350
Yeah, it is.

40
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:38,452
Okay, you're right! It is! Isn't this amazing?!

41
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:41,255
I just dove in! I said, "Hey, you wanna hang out at the fair?"

44
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,327
Yeah, I guess so! It totally worked!

45
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:50,497
All your advice about just going for it, it's finally paying off!

46
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,499
When are you going to learn, Dipper?

47
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,269
I'm always right about everything.

48
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:59,273
Hey, do you smell a gallon of body spray?

49
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,608
Hey, either of you dorks seen Wendy around?

50
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,644
Who wants to know? Hey!

51
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,280
Yeah, I got some new super tight jeans.

52
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:08,449
Thought she might wanna check 'em out.

53
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,285
Yeah, you know, I think I saw her in the bottomless pit.

54
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,553
You should really go jump in there.

55
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:14,688
Maybe I will, smart guy.

56
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,225
He is such a jerk.

57
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,227
Yeah, but he's a jerk with tight pants and a guitar.

58
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,329
I need to keep him away from wendy at all costs.

59
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:23,664
Don't worry, brother, whatever happens,

60
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:26,400
I'll be right here, supporting you ever step of--

61
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:27,668
Oh, my gosh! A pig!

62
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,507
If you can guess the critter's weight,

63
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,709
You can take the critter home!

64
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,616
- Mabel. - He said "Mabel"!

65
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,351
Either that or "Doorbell."

66
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:46,353
Did you say "Mabel" Or "Doorbell"?

67
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,354
Mabel.

68
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:52,392
Oh, look, Mabel here found her real twin.

69
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:54,695
Pacifica!

70
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,364
Sir, I must have that pig!

71
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:59,433
Ah, old fifteen-poundy!

72
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,602
So, how much you guessin' he weighs?

73
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:04,271
Um, 15 pounds?

74
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,406
Are you some kind of witch?

75
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:07,574
Well, there's your pig.

76
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,214
And you'll be needin' these.

77
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:16,450
No? Suit yourself.

78
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,587
Everything is different now.

79
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,524
Whoa! Check it out!

80
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:26,407
I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one!

81
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,429
My uncle taught me the secret to these games--

82
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,597
You aim for the carny's head

83
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:32,366
And take the prize when he's unconscious.

84
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,268
Nice.

85
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:35,335
One ball, please.

86
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,371
You only get one chance.

87
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,641
And a one, and a two, and a...

88
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:44,611
Ow! My eye!

89
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,580
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Wendy, are you okay?!

90
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:49,216
Does it look swollen?

91
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,219
Everything's gonna be fine! Don't worry! I'll...

92
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,587
I'll go get some ice!

93
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,227
Where is she? Where is she?

94
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,399
Hey, watch where you're going, man!

95
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:13,173
All right, just ease your eyeball into that freezy cone.

96
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:15,275
Robbie, thanks. That's really sweet--

97
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,344
The gesture and the flavored syrup.

98
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:21,448
Yeah, I was just here in the right place at the right time.

99
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,216
You know, I've been meanin' to ask you...

100
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,618
We've been spendin' a lot of time together

101
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:28,255
And I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go out with me?

102
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,358
Yeah, I guess so.

103
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:32,392
Sweet!

104
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,598
Look, Dipper! I won my pet pig!

105
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:38,665
His name is Waddles.

106
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,203
I call him that because he waddles! Waddles!

107
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:44,638
Everything is different now.

108
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:47,207
What are ya lookin' at?

109
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:07,394
Uh... Are you gonna move?

110
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:13,400
Paging Dr. Waddles, we got a boy here with a broken heart.

111
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,369
Come on, man, these are the jokes.

112
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:16,719
Mabel, do you ever wish

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,239
you could go back and undo just one mistake?

114
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:23,410
Nope! I do everything right all the time.

115
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:24,233
I mean, wendy only went out

116
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,579
with robbie because he was there with the ice,

117
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,481
And she only needed ice because of the baseball,

118
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,483
And I would have had the ice if it wasn't for...

119
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,418
that guy!

120
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:33,420
Hey, you! Tool belt! You ruined my life!

121
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,521
Huh?

122
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,356
Don't "Huh" Me! I've seen you before!

123
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,291
What's your deal? Are you following us around?

124
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:40,527
And why are you bald? What's all that about?

125
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,296
my position has been compromised!

126
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,566
Assuming stealth mode! Color match!

127
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:51,672
Initiating color match! Come on! Dang it!

128
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:55,575
That's amazing! Are you from the future or something?

129
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,311
Uh, no! Who told you that?!

130
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,313
Memory wipe!

131
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:02,582
This is a baby wipe.

132
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:05,485
all right, you've cornered me.

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,488
I'm a time traveler.

134
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,323
So wait a minute, if you're from the future,

135
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,492
Do you have, like, a time machine or something?

136
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,228
That's kinda how that works.

137
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:18,632
Could I borrow it?

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,469
Come on! Can I use your time machine just once?

139
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,259
Out of the question! You know this is sensitive,

140
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,296
Extremely complicated time equipment!

141
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,964
It looks like a tape measure.

142
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,200
You shut your time-mouth!

143
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,035
This makin' any sense to you?

144
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:36,104
I think he's just crazy.

145
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:37,271
Oh, you don't believe me?

146
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,711
Guess where I was!

147
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,147
That's right, 15 years ago there was a costume store right here!

148
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,382
One second!

149
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:50,351
Aw, heck! Pat!

150
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,021
- Pat down! - So who are you again?

151
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:58,259
Blendin Blandin, time anomaly removal crew, year 20-snyeventy-12!

152
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,428
My mission is to stop a series of time anomalies

153
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:03,097
That are supposed to happen at this very location!

154
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,133
B-but I don't see any anomalies!

155
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,394
I don't know if it's some kind of paradox

156
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:10,197
Or if I'm just really tired!

157
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:12,433
You know, you sound like you could use a break.

158
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,301
Definitely. Definitely.

159
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,701
Might we recommend one of

160
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,105
the various attractions at the mystery fair?

161
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,241
You know what? What the heck!

162
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,408
I'm worth it!

163
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:23,410
But I got my eye on you!

164
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,483
- One, please! - Aw, sorry, dude,

165
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,485
But you're gonna have to take your belt off for the ride.

166
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,488
One of your tools might fly off and accidently fix something.

167
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,158
Guard it with your life!

168
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,460
I will watch it like a hawk, dude.

169
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,401
Like a hawk!

170
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,470
Here it is, mabel--

171
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:52,139
Our ticket to any moment in history!

172
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:55,109
Lets go get two dodos and force them to make out!

173
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,218
No! We gotta be smart about this.

174
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,487
All that paradox talk kinda freaked me out.

175
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:02,223
All I'm gonna do is go back and fix my one mistake.

176
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:04,158
If I don't miss that baseball throw,

177
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,360
I won't hit Wendy in the eye, and robbie won't comfort her,

178
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,162
And they won't start going out.

179
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:12,099
I'm coming, too! I wanna relive the greatest moment of my life--

180
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,435
Winning Waddles! Mwah!

181
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,508
See ya later.

182
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,378
See you earlier! Yuck, yuck, yuck!

183
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:59,380
It's 12:00! The dunk tank is now open!

184
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:02,616
Step right up and dunk me, folks!

185
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,418
I'm talkin' to you, cut-offs!

186
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,419
Do-over?

187
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,421
Do-over!

188
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:10,424
If you can guess-- fifteen pounds!

189
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,394
And yes, I am a witch.

190
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:16,364
Well, time to round up a mob.

191
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,265
Hey, wendy. There you are.

192
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,533
Hey, what happened to your hat?

193
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,236
Uh, nothing. Hey, look! What's that?

194
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,348
Whoa! Check it out!

195
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:26,207
I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one!

196
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,375
One ball, please.

197
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,377
You only get one chance.

198
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,512
That's what you think.

199
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:34,448
One panda-duck, coming right up!

200
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,617
Okay, Dipper, second chance. Don't mess this up.

201
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,320
yes!

202
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,323
Ow! My eye!

203
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:43,324
What?!

204
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,226
Does it look swollen??

205
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,228
That's so weird.

206
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,662
Oh, hey, Robbie.

207
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,498
So anyway, we've been hangin' out a lot,

208
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:53,601
And I've been wondering if, uh, you wanted to go out with me?

209
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,403
Yeah, I guess so.

210
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,404
Sweet!

211
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,378
The exact same thing happened twice! It was spooky!

212
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,447
Ooh, maybe it's a time curse!

213
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,383
Waddles, can you say "Time curse"?

214
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,388
Your face is so fat!

215
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,390
Is it possible that the forces of time

216
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,293
Naturally conspire to undo any new outcomes?

217
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,395
No, no. I just need to try again.

218
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,596
Third time's the charm.

219
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,199
How hard can it be?

220
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,236
Find the witch!

221
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,179
Ow! My eye!

222
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,613
Hey, are you all right?

223
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,628
Aah! Ow! My eye!

224
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:57,264
Oh, bad luck.

225
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,506
Uh, Wendy? How badly do you want that stuffed animal thing?

226
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,409
More than anything in the world, Dipper.

227
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:12,246
Okay.

228
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,488
I love my pig!

229
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:24,358
If I adjust the ball for wind speed...

230
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,626
Factoring cotton candy...

231
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,461
Face it, dipper, you're obviously fated

232
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,396
To have a bad day at the fair.

233
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,532
Just like I'm fated to be with waddles!

234
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,300
It's like there's one variable missing.

235
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,202
What's a variable?

236
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,304
Ha! That's it!

237
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,540
I figured out a way to win the toss, not hit Wendy,

238
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:42,035
And stop Wendy and Robbie from going out!

239
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,211
Awesome! I'm gonna go win my pig again!

240
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't leave. I need you for my plan.

241
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:48,282
But what about Waddles?

242
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,251
It'll just take a few minutes! Let's go!

243
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,193
You gonna go, man?

244
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:01,529
And a one, and a two, and a...

245
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,364
Aw, dude, you missed.

246
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,465
Did I?

247
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,546
Huh?

248
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:24,418
Your stuffed creature of indeterminate species, miss.

249
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:26,487
Oh, awesome!

250
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,257
There you are, wendy. Hi, Robbie.

251
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,193
So I was wondering if, uh, you--

252
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,327
Look what Dipper got for me!

253
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:40,434
Whatever. Can't even tell what species it is. Stupid.

254
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:41,602
What's his deal?

255
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:44,305
Looks like I came to the fair with the right guy!

256
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,308
We have a winner!

257
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:51,312
Anytime, broseph.

258
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:55,149
Now to win my pig.

259
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,550
It's all yours! No one else's!

260
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:00,354
Old fifteen-poundy! Yours forever!

261
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,232
That was even more awesome the third time around!

262
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,567
Funnel cake! Let's go get some, Dipper!

263
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,273
What's w--

264
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,921
Mabel, what--

265
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,346
I'll just wait until you're done.

266
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,414
I'm done. Okay, what is wrong?

267
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,149
We messed up the timeline!

268
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,319
Pacifica saw the flier and won Waddles before I did!

269
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,321
She took Waddles, Dipper!

270
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,290
Oh, mabel, I'm sorry.

271
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:39,526
it's okay, we just need to go back and do things differently.

272
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,196
Mabel, wait! Look, I did the math--

273
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,365
In any other timeline, Wendy ends up going out with robbie!

274
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,133
I can't mess this day up again!

275
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,535
But if we don't go, then I'll lose Waddles forever!

276
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,536
Hey!

277
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,139
Give it back!

278
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:00,514
When are we?

279
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:04,184
The real question is, when are we?

280
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,736
Oh, wait, did you already--

281
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,387
- Yeah, I already-- - 'cause I was gonna--

282
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:07,554
- Yeah. Yeah, same thing. - All right.

283
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,556
Do you hear that?

284
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:35,828
Be on the look out for mountain lions, travelers!

285
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:38,731
Dysentery? Who wants dysentery?

286
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,899
Forge ahead, mighty oxen!

287
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:44,870
For a new life awaits us on this Oregon trail!

288
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,872
Where are we? The '70s?

289
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:50,709
You sent us back 150 years, genius! It's pioneer times!

290
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:52,459
By trembly! Fertilla,

291
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,748
it seems you've given birth to two more children!

292
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:59,985
It appears I have. More little hands to render the tallow.

293
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,987
Tallow? What?

294
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:04,556
Her mouth is filled with silver, mother!

295
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:05,691
These are called braces.

296
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,860
Mabel, we can't start messing with the past!

297
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:09,447
Oh, says the guy who messed

298
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,864
with the past all day, and cost me my pig?

299
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,599
I'll mess with whatever I want!

300
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,834
Check it out! A magic button machine!

301
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:19,438
Shoes that blink!

302
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,577
Hey, sister, guess who gets to vote in the future?

303
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:28,580
Ladies! Up top!

304
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:31,583
That's called a high-five. Teach it to your friends.

305
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,852
Give me that! I'm gonna set the timeline right!

306
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,587
Hey! No!

307
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,565
Run! Take cover!

308
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:48,634
It's coming!

309
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,639
This future seems neat.

310
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,511
I'm coming, waddles!

311
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,646
Hey!

312
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,482
I seen it! I seen it again!

313
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:04,650
But enough about me.

314
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:07,853
Behold... Me!

315
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,428
This thing is getting hotter!

316
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:17,796
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!

317
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:19,865
- What did you do?! - I don't know!

318
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,477
Where are we?

319
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:33,579
It's nothing but inky blackness for miles!

320
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:37,716
Mabel, don't you see? We've transported to the end of time!

321
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,657
Wait, why does it smell so bad in here?

322
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,865
Look! We're back in the present!

323
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,566
But which present?

324
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,936
This is the best present ever! Yes!

325
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,741
No! Give me that thing!

326
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,911
Dipper, give it back!

327
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,547
Look, mabel, it's over, okay? Give it up!

328
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:10,549
I've worked too hard to lose this!

329
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,652
But what about waddles? He was my soul mate!

330
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,821
You said that about a ball of yarn once!

331
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:18,557
Do you really want wendy to date robbie?

332
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:19,825
I don't know.

333
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,801
You're not guilt-tripping me, mabel. Not this time.

334
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,179
Come on, Mabel, I know you.

335
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,609
You're gonna forget about this in a day.

336
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,678
Here! Hey, I'll prove it!

337
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,783
See?

338
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,456
Okay, maybe you'll forget in a week.

339
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,529
A month. She'll be better in a month!

340
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:05,504
Waddles. Waddles.

341
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:07,506
And if you look to your left, you'll see miserable Mabel--

342
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,793
The girl who went bonkers after

343
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,776
her dreams were shattered by some heartless jerk.

344
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,843
Oh, hey, Dipper!

345
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,391
I don't know if it's a duck or a panda, but I want one.

346
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,462
Wendy, I just wanted to say that...

347
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,764
Well, I just wanted to say that people make mistakes,

348
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,467
And when they do, you should forgive them.

349
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,436
And also, that tight pants are overrated.

350
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,737
Dude, you lost me.

351
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,439
I know.

352
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:41,607
One ball, please.

353
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,442
You only get one chance.

354
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,745
And a one, and a two, and a...

355
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,881
Ow! My eye!

356
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,883
Hey, Wendy, are you okay?

357
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,753
You know, this is the perfect time for me to ask you something.

358
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:57,589
It is done.

359
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,759
Dipper! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

360
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:02,427
Thank you.

361
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,862
He's saying "Thank you" In pig!

362
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,530
Aren't you, Waddles?

363
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,470
I couldn't break your heart, Mabel.

364
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:15,440
Besides, there's no way wendy can date robbie all summer, right?

365
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:16,541
You two!

366
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:22,447
Do you have any idea how many rules you just broke?!

367
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,791
I'm asking, I wasn't there with you.

368
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,652
It was probably a lot, right?

369
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,487
Blendin Blandin!

370
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:32,491
the time paradox avoidance enforcement squadron!

371
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,826
That's right, and our phones have been ringing off the hook.

372
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,928
There's settlers high-fiving in the 1800s

373
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:39,898
And calculators littered through eight centuries!

374
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,733
You are under arrest for violations

375
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,702
Of the time travelers code of conduct.

376
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:44,736
It was those kids!

377
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,571
And their leader, Waddles!

378
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:47,739
That's a pig, Blendin.

379
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:49,508
Oh! I'll get you for this!

380
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:53,679
I'll go back in time and make sure your parents never meet!

381
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:54,780
Well, we're still here.

382
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,682
Guess he forgot to go back.

383
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,583
Ha! You suckers!

384
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:01,586
Your pockets are empty and I'm still sitting high and dry!

385
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:02,954
Boo!

386
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,491
Yeah, boo! Boo! I love it!

387
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:10,562
Hey, biceps! Yeah, I'm talking to you, haircut!

388
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:12,497
Take your best shot!

389
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,711
So I guess we never found out who was causing

390
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,547
Those time anomalies blendin was looking for.

391
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:31,450
Wait, Mabel... I think it was us.

392
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:33,685
Ugh, my brain hurts.

393
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,422
Aw, jeez, I gotta deal with this all summer?

394
00:21:37,457 --> 00:21:39,591
it's good. It's caramel.

395
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,759
I'm on it.

396
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:51,536
My pants! They're shrinking!

397
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,812
Oh, man.

398
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:03,749
That'll do, pig.

399
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:07,753
That'll do.

400
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:12,357
You have broken the eternal laws of space-time.

401
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,692
I beg your mercy, time baby!

402
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,595
You now must clean up all of the anomalies.

403
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:26,805
Old man mcguckett, local kook!

404
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,474
Are the wax figures alive?

405
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:34,813
What are you looking at?
