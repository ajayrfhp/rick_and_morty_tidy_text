That... that's not the point.
The point is to stay out of my room.

Then tell your little nerdy friend
to shut his mouth.

- Well, well, well, look who it is.
- Sorry, man.

160

Well, when you were having
sister problems, Dart grew again,

162

he escaped, and I'm pretty sure
he's a baby Demogorgon.

- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later.

164
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,020
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve?

165
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,940

and wrist rocket.

saying, like, nothing ever happened,

happened in movies and comic books.

304
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,980
Is that okay?

305
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,230
Okay.

306
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,080
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know
if you feel anything. Okay?

307
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,330
<font color="#ff00ff">[soft screeching]</font>

308
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,550
<font color="#ff00ff">[beeping regularly]</font>

309
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,470
- Do you feel anything?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> Little sting.

310
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,100
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Owens]</font> It stings? Where?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screeches]</font>

311
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,350
<font color="#ff00ff">[grunts]</font> My chest.

312
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,560
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie...

313
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,890
<font color="#ff00ff">[Will groans]</font>

314
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,100
- How about now?
- It... it burns.

315
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,610
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screeches]</font>
- Ah!

316
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,070
- It burns.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Owens]</font> Where?

317
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,440
<font color="#ff00ff">[groans]</font> Everywhere.

318
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,070
That's enough. That's enough!

319
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,070
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font>
- Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

320
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,490
That's it! We're done!

321
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,330
- Okay.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[monitor beeping rapidly]</font>

322
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,120
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

323
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,210
<font color="#ff00ff">[beeping regularly]</font>

324
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,840
Our best guess right now
is it's some kind of virus

325
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,220
which is causing
this neurological disorder.

326
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,430
Now, when... when a typical virus
attaches itself to its host...

327
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,850
<font color="#ff00ff">[coughs]</font>

328
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:01,480
...it duplicates, right? It spreads,
essentially hijacking the host.

329
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,060
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.

330
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,520
<font color="#ff00ff">[growling]</font>

331
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,190
That's not... That's not unusual.

332
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,610
What is so unusual here,

333
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,370
this virus... the infected hosts
seem to be communicating.

334
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,990
<font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font>

335
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,960
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,
and it's connecting all the hosts.

336
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,170
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screeches]</font>
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font>

337
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,630
The good news is a virus can be cured.

338
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,460
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.

339
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,630
We're gonna see what we find.

340
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,060
What happens
when he can't remember anything?

341
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,430
<font color="#ff00ff">[stutters]</font> When there's
nothing else there?

342
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,150
What happens when my boy is gone?

343
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,110
<font color="#ff00ff">[crying]</font>

344
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,820
<font color="#ff00ff">[Steve]</font> All right,
so let me get this straight.

345
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,240
You kept something
you knew was probably dangerous

346
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,250
in order to impress a girl who...
who you just met?

347
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,750
All right,
that's grossly oversimplifying things.

348
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,420
I mean, why would a girl
like some nasty slug anyway?

349
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,050
An interdimensional slug?
Because it's awesome.

350
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,930
Well, even if she thought it was cool,
which she didn't, I... I just...

351
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,340
I don't know. I just feel like
you're trying too hard.

352
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,960
Well, not everyone can have
your perfect hair, all right?

353
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,680
It's not about the hair, man.

354
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,810
The key with girls is just...
just acting like you don't care.

355
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,520
- Even if you do?
- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

356
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,190
- Then what?
- You just wait until, uh...

357
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,320
- until you feel it.
- Feel what?

358
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,910
It's like before it's gonna storm,
you know?

359
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,700
You can't see it,
but you can feel it, like this, uh...

360
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,580
electricity, you know?

361
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,630
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

362
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,210
No, no, no, no, no.
Like a... Like a sexual electricity.

363
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Oh.

364
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,760
You feel that and then you make your move.

365
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,300
So that's when you kiss her?

366
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,060
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.

367
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,230
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah,
they want you to be aggressive.

368
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,020
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...

369
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,730
- I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.

370
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,570
But others, you gotta be slow,
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

371
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
like a ninja.

372
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,780
What type is Nancy?

373
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,830
Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.

374
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,500
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

375
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,210
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

376
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,050
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.

377
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

378
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,510
You're not falling in love with this girl,
are you?

379
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,970
Uh, no. No.

380
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,890
- Okay, good. Don't.
- I won't.

381
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,390
She's only gonna break your heart,
and you're way too young for that shit.

382
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,440
Fabergé.

383
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,530
What?

384
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,450
It's Fabergé Organics.

385
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,580
Use the shampoo and conditioner,
and when your hair's damp...

386
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,790
It's not wet, okay?

387
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,460
- When it's damp...
- Damp.

388
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,790
You do four puffs
of the Farrah Fawcett spray.

389
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,800
- Farrah Fawcett spray?
- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

390
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,970
You tell anyone I just told you that
and your ass is grass.

391
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,010
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?

392
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,090
Yup.

393

<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

394
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
Okay.

395
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,810
- Farrah Fawcett, really?
- I mean, she's hot.

396
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,520
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Yeah.

<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

402
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
It's me.

403
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,550
I know that I've been
gone too long, and, uh...

404
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
It's... I just, I want you to know
that it's not about you

405
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,720
and it's not about our fight.

406
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Okay?

407
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,230
Something came up, and I will...
I will explain it all when I see you.

408
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,780
I just... I want you to know
that I'm not mad.

409
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,280
I'm just sorry.

410
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,410
About everything.

411
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,790
I...

412
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,750
I don't want you to get hurt at all.

413
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,340
And I don't wanna lose you.

414
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,390
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

415
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,140
<font color="#ff00ff">[sniffles]</font> Just make sure you heat up
some real food. Not just Eggos.

416
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,190
And I want you to eat all the peas,
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

417
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,190
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

418
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,820
I will be home soon.

419
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,560
<font color="#ff00ff">[doctor]</font> This is him last week.

420
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,540
And there are the hippocampal
abnormalities we had discussed.

421
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,330
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

422
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,460
from others suffering
from post-traumatic stress. But...

423
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,920
this is Will from last night.

424
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,130
And as you can see,

425
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,920
there are now abnormalities
in the limbic and paralimbic areas.

426
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,010
And this...

427
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,970
is from an hour ago.

428
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,150
- <font color="#ff00ff">[stutters]</font> I don't hear any suggestions.
- We have bigger problems than the boy.

429
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,570
- Do we?
- We can't keep delaying the burn.

430
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,110
You're talking about putting... <font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font>
putting a Band-Aid on this.

431
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,330
- Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[doctor]</font> It's our only option.

432
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,120
- And if it kills the boy?
- Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

433
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,460
Say that to me again.

434
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,010
The rate this is spreading,
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

435
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,220
What we do or don't do
won't change the outcome.

436
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,890
We have to start the burn.

437
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,430
Where you going?

438
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,180
I'm going to think.

439
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,610

- I need to talk to...

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,880
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

Uh...

454
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,630
I saw something.

455
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,090
In your now-memories?

456
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,310
The shadow monster.

457
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,350
I think I know how to stop him.

458
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
<font color="#ff00ff">[Steve sighs]</font>

459
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,830
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

460
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,870
This will do just fine.

461
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,580

462
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,800
<font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> I said medium-well!

00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,010
Who's that?

464
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,860
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> You told her?

465
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,690
- So what?
- "So what?"

466
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,960
- You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right?

467
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,740
We agreed not to tell her
and to look for Dart.

468
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,910
- Who you conveniently found.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

469
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,530
I'm saying you have
a creepy little bond with him.

470
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,910
Yeah, that was before
he turned into a Demogorgon.

471
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,870
- And you haven't heard from Mike?
- No.

472
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,170
- Or Will?
- No.

473
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,880
- Hopper?
- No! No one is around.

474
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,170
Why do you think
I'm with Steve Harrington?

475
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,010
- Something's...
- Wrong. I agree.

476
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,720
Which is why we need
as much help as we can get.

<font color="#ff00ff">[Max grunting]</font>

478
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> She didn't believe me anyway.

479
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,310
You probably didn't tell it right.

480
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,520
That must be it.

481
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,610
So, we good?

482
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,990
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one
helping me out is this random girl?

483
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,990
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.
Let's go, I said!

484
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,490
- All right, asshole! God!
- Okay! Stupid.

485
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,970
What...

486
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,600
What is all of this?

487
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,900
<font color="#ff00ff">[breathing heavily]</font> I don't know.

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Will?

490
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,140
I don't shoot Polaroid.

491
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,770
- What?
- It's not mine.

492
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,310
Someone else has been here.

493
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,450
Sam, this is ludicrous.

494
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,790
- Just give him a moment, okay?
- We don't have time...

495
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,170
Hey, jackass, why don't you
do us all a favor and shut up, okay?

496
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,680
<font color="#ff00ff">[Will]</font> That's it.

498
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
I don't know.

499
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,070
I just know
he doesn't want me to see there.

500
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,240
I think it's important.

510
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,100
So you really fought
one of these things before?

511
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,480
And you're, like, totally,
100% sure it wasn't a bear?

512
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,650
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?
It wasn't a bear.

513
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,940
Why are you even here
if you don't believe us?

514
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,240
Just go home.

515
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,320
Geesh. Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime?

516
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,210
That's good. Just show her you don't care.

517
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,250
I don't.

518
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,500
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

521
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,810
Looks like the ocean.

- You miss it?
- What?

523
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,740
The ocean. The waves? California?

524
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,780
- Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
- No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

525
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,080
My dad's still there. So...

526
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,170
- Why?
- It's this legal term called "divorce."

527
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,760
See, when two married people
don't love each other anymore...

528
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah.

529
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,260
My mom and my stepdad,

530
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,890
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

531
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,690
As if... As if he was the problem,
which is total bull.

532
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,400
And things...

533
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,240
are just worse now.

534
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,860
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

535
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:37,580
but now he's just angry...
all the time and...

536
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,330
Well, he can't take it out
on my mom, so...

537
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,050
So he takes it out on you?

538
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,180
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

539
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,430
It's just... I know that I can be
a jerk like him sometimes,

540
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,980
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

541
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,190
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

542
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,250
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

544
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,330
Hey. You're nothing
like your brother, okay?

545
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,790
You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.

546

00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,760
And it makes you seem really cool.

I don't know.

It's that damn graveyard.
