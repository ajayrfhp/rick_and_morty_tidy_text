and then you were there.

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,740
Did you go see Mike?

78
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
He didn't see me.

79
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter
did and they called the cops.

I go!

88
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,720
And I never leave!

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,020
Nothing ever happens!

90
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,440

91
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,400

I protect and I feed and I teach!

that you follow three simple rules.

Three rules. And you know what?

95
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,210
You can't even do that!

You know what that means?

99
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,430
It means no Eggos...

100
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,140
And no TV for a week.

101
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,770

Well, congratulations.

108

to no TV at all!

You have got to understand that
there are consequences to your actions.

You wanna go back in the lab?

116

Yeah, well,
I'm not so crazy about you, either.

119

You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.

Okay, let me see.

165
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,830
Is it a fever?

166
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,040
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.

167
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,420
Do you feel cold?

168
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,130
No. Just a little out of it.

169
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,630
Like I haven't really woken up yet.

170
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,010
You promised no doctor.

171
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,050
And I meant it. No doctor.

172
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
You know what?

173
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm gonna run you a nice bath
and it'll warm you up

174
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,890
and hopefully get you feeling better.

175
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,020

<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce on answering machine]</font> Hey,
you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...

322
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,750
<font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> Anything?

323
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,500
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.

324
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Party members only.

325
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,050
Come on, Mike.

326
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,840
No! This is non-negotiable.

327
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,800
- Sorry, Max.
- Sorry.

328
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,350
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Will didn't want me to tell anyone,

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,940
but on Halloween night
he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.

330
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,860
A shadow?

331
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,570
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> What kind of shadow?

332
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't know. But it scared him.

333
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,160
And if Will really has True Sight...

334
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,450
I mean, if he can really see
into the Upside Down,

335
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,540
maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.

336
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,080
- So that's why he was frozen like that?
- Maybe.

337
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,170
Can it hurt him?

338
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean, if this shadow thing
isn't from our world...

339
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,750
I'm not sure. Dustin?

340
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,210
Well, if you're in another plane,

341
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,130
you can't interact
with the material plane,

342
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,300
so theoretically,
no, the shadow can't hurt him.

343
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,010
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.

344
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,680
This isn't D & D. This is real life.

345
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
So what do we do?

346
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,560
We acquire more knowledge.

347
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,140
I'll go to Will's after school.
See what's going on.

348
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,550
You guys stay here and find Dart.

349
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,310
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?

350
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,940
Will heard him in the Upside Down.

351
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,440
I don't know how yet,
but he's gotta be connected to all this.

352
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,610
He's gotta be.

353
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,780
If we find Dart,
maybe we can solve this thing.

354
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,200
Maybe we can help Will.

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,120
Sorry about that.
Hospitality's not our strong suit.

363

You know, scientists and all.

364
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,300
Yeah. Okay.

365
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,340
You up for a little walk?

366
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,640

- <font color="#ff00ff">[door opens]</font>

"Men of science have made
abundant mistakes of every kind."

368
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,640
George Sarton said that.

369
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,560
You guys know who George Sarton is?
Doesn't really matter.

370
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,110
The point is,
mistakes have been made. Yes.

371
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,480
- Mistakes?
- Yes.

372
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,690
You killed Barbara.

373
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,610
Abundant mistakes, but,
the men involved with those mistakes,

374
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,620
the ones responsible for what happened
to your brother and Miss Holland's death,

375
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,410
they're gone.
They're gone, and for better for worse,

376
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,620
I'm the schmuck they brought in
to make things better.

377
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,840
But I can't make things better
without your help.

378
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,550
You mean without us shutting up?

379
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,920
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> She's tough, this one.
You guys been together long?

380
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,760
- We're not together.
- Wanna see what really killed your friend?

381
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,220
Teddy, I brought you an audience today.
I hope you don't mind.

382
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,520
<font color="#ff00ff">[Teddy]</font> More the merrier, sir.

383
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,440
<font color="#ff00ff">[Owens]</font> I'd call it one hell of a mistake.

384
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,030
Wouldn't you?

385
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,490
See, the thing is,
we can't seem to erase our mistake...

386
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,990
but we can stop it from spreading.

387
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,080
Like, it's like pulling weeds.

388
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,290
But imagine for a moment
if a foreign state,

389
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,840
let's say, the Soviets...
If they heard about our mistake...

390
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,090
do you think they would even
consider that a mistake?

391
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,390
What if they tried to replicate that?

392
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,770
The more attention we bring to ourselves,
the more...

393
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,230
the more people like the Hollands
know the truth,

394
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,530
the more likely that scenario becomes.

395
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,280
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

396
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,320
Just, same as those weeds there.

397
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,750
By whatever means necessary.

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,450
This is more of the same.

They connect.

No.

410
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,610
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> I mean,
is it some sort of maze or a road?

411
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,900
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> I mean, it's sort of forking
and branching like... like lightning.

412
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,150
You think it's that storm?

413
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,780
No, the storm he drew was
completely different. He used red.

414
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,000
And this is all blue
and it has some weird dirt color.

415
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,790
I mean, maybe it's roots.

he was saying it was spreading and...
