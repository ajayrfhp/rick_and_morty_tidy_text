<font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> It's the lab.

153
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,250
They were going back home.

154
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[growling]</font>

155
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,560
Look, this is us,
and this is the nearest exit.

156
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,220
But even if we somehow make it there,
there's no way out.

157
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,390
- What do you mean?
- The locks are fail secure.

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Fail secure?

159
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,860
If there's a power outage,
the building goes on lockdown.

160
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,320
Can it be unlocked remotely?

161
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,900
With a computer, sure,
but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.

162
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,220
- Where are the breakers?
- Breakers are in the basement,

163
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,450
three floors down.

164
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,070
Hey, where are you going?

165
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,530
To reset the breakers.

166
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,700
Okay, then what?

167
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,330
- Then we get out of here.
- No, then the power comes back on.

168
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,370
If you wanna unlock the doors,
you have to reboot the computer system,

169
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,040
and then override the security codes
with a manual input.

170
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,500
Fine, how do I do that?

171
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,170
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.

172
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,630
I don't know what that means.

173
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,970
- It's a computer programming language.
- Teach it to me.

174
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,260
<font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font> Shall I teach you French
while I'm at it, Jim?

175
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,430
How about a little German?

176
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,560
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?

177
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,100
No. <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

178
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,060
<font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font> Okay, I got this.

179
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I got this.

180
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,940
No. Bob.

181
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,940
It's okay.

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,910
It's gonna be okay.
Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.

183

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,010

<font color="#ff00ff">[Bob grunting and panting]</font>

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,720
All right, you know
how to use one of these?

188
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,730
<font color="#ff00ff">[panting]</font> No.

189
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,280
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.

190
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,990
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.

191
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,070
If anything happens down there,
I want you to come right back up.

192
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,740
Right back here. Listen.

193
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Don't wait for me.
As soon as I get those doors open...

194
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,080
- I'm gonna get them out.
- Yeah?

195
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,500
I promise.

196
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,670
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.

197
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,520
<font color="#ff00ff">[Jonathan]</font> Why are the lights off?

198
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,440
<font color="#ff00ff">[Nancy]</font> Maybe it's closed?

200
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,730
I don't think so.

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
<font color="#ff00ff">[Nancy]</font> It's not working?

202
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,070
No! The power's off.

203
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,540
- Jonathan?
- What?

204
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,040
<font color="#ff00ff">[rustling]</font>

205
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,540
I think there's something in the woods.

206
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
<font color="#ff00ff">[whispering]</font> Nancy, stay back.

207
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,960

What are you doing here?

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,810
What are you doing here?

214
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,730
We're looking for Mike and Will.

215
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,440
They're not in there, are they?
- We're not sure.

216
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,400
Why?

Right, I'll meet you outside.

Nice job.

249
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,690
- Hold on a second, Chief.
- What's wrong?

250
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,820
West stairwell's not clear anymore.

251
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,950
- What's going on?
- We've got some company.

252
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,330
- Where?
- The west stairwell.

253
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,700
I got an idea.

254
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,710

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,090
Okay. And splash.

- What?
- Take this.

- Is there a problem?

270
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,770
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting
a little crowded up here,

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,480
so we're gonna have to take this slow.

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,200

<font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font>

311
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,880
No!

312
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,010
No!

313
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
<font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Go!

314
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,620
No!

315
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,040
Go!

<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> Bob!

317
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,370
- <font color="#ff00ff">[door buzzing]</font>
- Bob!

318
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,040
No!

319
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,130
- What happened?
- No!

320
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,340
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screeching]</font>
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> No!

321
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,430
- He's gone! He's gone!
- <font color="#ff00ff">[horn honking]</font>

322
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,430
Come on! Get in!

323
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,310
<font color="#ff00ff">[screeches]</font>

324
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,280
Guys?

325
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,780
<font color="#ff00ff">[horn honking]</font>

326
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Let's go.

327
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,290
Come on!

328
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,500
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

329
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,670
<font color="#ff00ff">[monsters growling]</font>

330
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,670
I'm sorry, bud.

331
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,420
Sorry I wasn't there.
I should have been here.

332
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,010
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[woman]</font> How many people at the lab?

333
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,840
I don't know how many people are there!

334
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,970
I don't know how many people
are left alive!

335
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,890
- Have you contacted the police?
- I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!

336
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,770
Is there a number I can reach you at?

337
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,810
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.

338
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,440
- Okay, yes, I got it.
- 6767...

339
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,150
- I will be here.
- I'll have them contact you.

340
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,070
They didn't believe you, did they?

341
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,700
We'll see.

342
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,450
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here
while those things are loose!

343
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,040
We stay here, and we wait for help.

344
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,890
<font color="#ff00ff">[knocks softly]</font>

345
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,870
<font color="#ff00ff">[grunts softly]</font>

346
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,720
Did you guys know that Bob was
the original founder of Hawkins AV?

347
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,970
Really?

348
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,970
He petitioned the school
to start it and everything.

349
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,850
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

350
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,520
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

351
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,980
Pretty awesome, right?

352
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,150
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin and Lucas]</font> Yeah.

353
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,940
We can't let him die in vain.

354
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,360
What do you want to do, Mike?

355
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,650
The Chief's right on this.

356
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,570
We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.

357
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,700
Demo-dogs?

358
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,700
Demogorgon dogs.

359
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Demo-dogs.

360
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,540
It's like a compound.

361
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,380
It's like a play on words...

362
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
Okay.

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,760
- I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
- But there's an army now.

364
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,760
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Precisely.
- His army.

365
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
What do you mean?

366
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,050
His army.

367
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,060
Maybe if we stop him,
we can stop his army, too.

368
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,370
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> The shadow monster.
- It got Will that day on the field.

369
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,480
The doctor said it was like a virus,
it infected him.

370
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,320
And so this virus,
it's connecting him to the tunnels?

371
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,510
To the tunnels, monsters,
the Upside Down, everything.

372
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,410
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

373
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,620
Okay, so,
the shadow monster's inside everything.

374
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,540
And if the vines feel something like pain,
then so does Will.

375
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,080
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

376
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,830
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

377
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,250
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

378
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,090
And this is the thing that
controls everything. It's the brain.

379
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,800
Like the mind flayer.

380
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,760
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> The what?
- What?

381
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,970
The mind flayer.

382
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
What the hell is that?

383
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,990
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.

384
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,690
It's so ancient
that it doesn't even know its true home.

385
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,980
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

386
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,940
by taking over their brains using
its highly-developed psionic powers.

387
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,030
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

388
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,530
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.

389
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,950
And unless you know something
that we don't,

390
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,330
this is the best metaphor...

391
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,490
Analogy.

392
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,790
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?

393
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,120
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

394
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,250
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

395
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,960
- Flayer. Mind flayer.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

396
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,130
What does it want?

397
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,590
To conquer us, basically.

398
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,420
It believes it's the master race.

399
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,840
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> Like the Germans?

400
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,680
Uh, the Nazis?

401
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,180
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

402
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,640
If the Nazis were
from another dimension, totally.

403
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,940
Uh, it views other races, like us,
as inferior to itself.

404
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,900
It wants to spread,
take over other dimensions.

405
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,240
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

406
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,860
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

407
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,830
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain
that's controlling everything,

408
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,620
then if we kill it...

409
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,330
We kill everything it controls.

410
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,500
- We win.
- Theoretically.

411
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,540
Great. So how do you kill this thing?
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

412
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,420
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font> No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

413
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,800
Uh, you summon an undead army,
uh, because...

414
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,050
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammering]</font> ...because zombies,
you know, they don't have brains,

415
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,770
and the mind flayer, it... it...
It likes brains.

416
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,450
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

417
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,100
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

418
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,400
We are!

419
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,860
How are they gonna stop this?

420
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,380
You can't just shoot this with guns.

421
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,490
You don't know that!
We don't know anything!

422
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,740
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

423
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,530
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.

424
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,030
We know that it's only a matter of time
before those tunnels reach this town.

425
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,990
<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> They're right.

426
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,250
We have to kill it.

427
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,920
I want to kill it.

428
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
- Me, too.
- I...

429
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,380
Me, too, Joyce, okay?

430
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,550
But how do we do that?

431
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,920
We don't exactly know
what we're dealing with here.

432
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,930
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> No. But he does.

433
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,720
If anyone knows
how to destroy this thing, it's Will.

434
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,560
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

435
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
<font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> I thought
we couldn't trust him anymore.

436
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,150
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

437
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,030
Yeah, but he can't spy
if he doesn't know where he is.

438
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,870
Yeah, this'll work.

439
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,410
<font color="#ff00ff">[grunting]</font>

440
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Hey.

441
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,770
What you did, um, helping the kids...

442
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,650
that was... really cool.

443
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,230
Yeah.

444
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,820
Those little shits are real trouble,
you know?

445
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,370
Believe me, I know.

446
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,260
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Hey.

447
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,010
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

448
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,220
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

449
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,350
I was wrong.

450
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,310
I broke the rule of law,

451
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,190
so if you want your girlfriend to take
over my spot in the party, I understand.

452
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,320
She's not my girlfriend.

453
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,610
I saw you two
holding hands in the bus, Lucas.

454
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,530
She was just scared.

455
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,320
Maybe, but I could feel it.

456
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,620
Feel what?

457
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,370
The electricity.

458
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

459
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,760
I get why El was your mage now.

460
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,220
What?

461
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,350
Lucas. He told me all about her.

462
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,430
Well, he shouldn't have.

463
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,730
And just because you know the truth,
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

464
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,980
You do know that, right?

465
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,280
Yeah, I know.

466
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,620
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer
in your party anyway?

467
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,290
I'm just saying, El?

468
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,830
She sounds like she was really awesome.

469
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,250
Yeah, she was.

470
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,630
Until that thing took her.

471
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,170
Just like it took Bob.

472
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,640
You sure this is gonna work?

473
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,470
He knew who I was.

474
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,270
He's still in there.

475
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,940
It's gonna work.

476
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,480
It has to.

477
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,530
- All right, you ready?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> Yeah.

478
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,710
<font color="#ff00ff">[gasps]</font>

479
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,570
If he finds out where we are...

480
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,830
will he send those dogs after us?

481
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,080
He won't find out.

482
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,040
Yeah, but, if he does...

483
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,220
Judgment day.

484
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,060
<font color="#ff00ff">[grunts]</font> What? What? What is this?

485
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,320
What? What is this?

486
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,570
Why am I tied up?

487
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,240
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

488
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,620
We're not gonna hurt you.

489
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,830
Where am I?

490
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,910
You recognize this?

491
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Do you recognize this?

492
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,710
<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> Hey.

493
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,550
We wanna help you.

494
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,130
But to do that,
we have to understand how to kill it.

495
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,720
Why am I tied up?

496
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,760
Why am I tied up?

497
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,300
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,270

504
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,080

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,210
Go...

506
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,800
Go...

507
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,190
Do you know what March 22nd is?

508
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,520
It's your birthday.

509
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,690
Your birthday.

510
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,330
When you turned eight,
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

511
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,950
Do you remember that?

512
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,410
It was 120 colors.

513
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,210
And all your friends,
they got you Star Wars toys,

514
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,010
but all you wanted to do was draw
with all your new colors.

515
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,810
And you drew this big spaceship,
but it wasn’t from a movie.

516
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,930
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> It was your spaceship.

517
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,770
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

518
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,480
And you must have used
every color in the box.

519
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,120
I took that with me to Melvald's

520
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,000
and I put it up
and I told everyone who came in,

521
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,330
"My son drew this."

522
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,880
And you were so embarrassed. <font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font>

523
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,050
But I was so proud.

524
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,100
I was so, so proud.

525
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,270
<font color="#ff00ff">[breathing shakily]</font>

526
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,100
Do you remember the day Dad left?

527
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,570
We stayed up all night
building Castle Byers...

528
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,950
just the way you drew it.

529
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,950
And it took so long
because you were so bad at hammering.

530
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,540
<font color="#ff00ff">[both chuckle]</font>

531
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,920
You'd miss the nail every time.

532
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,210
And then it started raining,
but we stayed out there anyway.

533
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,840
We were both sick
for like a week after that.

534
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,680
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?

535
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,760
We just had to.

536
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,770
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Do you remember
the first day that we met?

It was... It was
the first day of kindergarten.

538
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,110
I knew nobody.

539
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,400
I had no friends and...

540
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,200
<font color="#ff00ff">[sniffling]</font> I just felt so alone
and so scared, but...

541
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,960
I saw you on the swings
and you were alone, too.

542
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
You were just swinging by yourself.

543
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,470
And I just walked up to you and...

544
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,680
I asked.

545
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,970
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.

546
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,140
And you said yes.

547
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,230
You said yes.

548
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,320
It was the best thing I've ever done.

549
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,040
Will, baby...

550
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,250
if you're in there, just please...
please talk to us.

551
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,130
Please, honey, please,
can you do that for me?

552
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,930
- Please. I love you so much.

Do you remember
the first time I played you this?

565
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,700
Mom and Dad were both arguing
in the next room.

566
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,390
So I played you the mix tape I made you.

567
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,790
And it was the first time
you got into music. Real music.

568
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,590

- Yeah, got it.
- C.

570
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,760
And then the party
escaped into the sewers,

571
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,140
and there were those big insect things,
and you guys were still on level one.
