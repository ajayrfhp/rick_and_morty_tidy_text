Something hungry for blood.

A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

- It is almost here.
- What is it?

12
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,280
What if it's the Demogorgon?

13
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,410
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

It's not the Demogorgon.

An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

No, that...

24

- Fireball him!

28
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,150
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

29
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

32
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,360
It stomps towards you.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,450

34

[Will] I don't know!

[Lucas] Where is it?
[Dustin] Oh, my God!

[Karen] Mike!
[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,606
[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

43

[Will] No, I can't find it!

Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,550
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,810
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

48
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,600
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,150
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

50
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,830
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,110
I'm serious, Mom.

52
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,650
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,716
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

You've been playing for ten hours?

- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,460
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,260
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,220
- Does anyone want this?
- [both] No.

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,850
[Nancy] Yeah.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,230
No, I don't think...

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,940
Yeah, he's cute.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,360
Barb, no, I don't think so.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,900
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,216
There's a slice left if you want it.

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,580
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,380
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

70
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,316
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,860
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,090
She's always been a real jerk.

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,050
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

75
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,576
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,810
[Mike] Four years ago!

77
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,350
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

78
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,980
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,810
The roll, it was a seven.

80
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,110
The Demogorgon, it got me.

81
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,150
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

83
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,260
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

84

- Any comic?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,150

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,306
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

161
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,040
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

162
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

163
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,356
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

164
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,050
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- [sighs] I can't believe you.

165
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,720
I can't believe you sometimes.

166
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,270
- [phone ringing]
- That's disgusting.

167
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,560
- [Mike] You're disgusting!
- Hello?

168
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,400
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

169
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,520
- [Karen] Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

170
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,780
- [Ted] Hey!
- Quiet!

171
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,570
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

172
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,030
Was that Will I heard back there?

173
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,610
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

174
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,110
Will didn't spend the night?

175
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,620
[Karen] <i>No, he left here</i>
<i>a little bit after 8:00.</i>

176
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,040
Why? He's not home?

177
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,960
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

178
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
- Thank you so much. Bye.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

179
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,390
[school bell ringing]

180
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,900
That's weird.
I don't see him.

181
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,586
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

182
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,440
He probably just
went to class early again.

183
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,086
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

184
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,030
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,370
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

186
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,080
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

187
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,750
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

188
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,010
[sighs]

189
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,340
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

190
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,890
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

191
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,720
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

192
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,810
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

193
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,930
- [chuckles]
- Do the arm thing.

194
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,060
Do it, freak!

195
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,320
- [bones cracking]
- [both groaning]

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,650
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

197
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,820
- Assholes.
- [Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

198
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,080
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

199
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,040
Like Mr. Fantastic.

200
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,370
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

201
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,460
[bell ringing]

202
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,510
[Barbara] So, did he call?

203
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,140
Keep your voice down.

204
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,800
Did he?

205
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,640
I told you, it's not like that.

206
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,980
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

207
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,980
We just...

208
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,610
made out a couple times.

209
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,070
"We just... made out a couple times."

210
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,490
Nance, seriously,

211
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,650
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

212
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,160
No, I'm not.

213
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,910
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

214
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,790
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol...

215
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,160
Oh, that's gross!

216
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,420
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

217
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,340
- Two-time thing.
- [chuckles]

218
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,470
You were saying?

219
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,350
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

220
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,110
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

221
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,480
[bell ringing]

222
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,860
Steve.
I really, like...

223
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,780
Seriously, I have to go.

224
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,240
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

225
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,200
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

226
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,200
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

227
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,540
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

228
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,330
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

229
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,580
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

230
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

231
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,090
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

232
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,130
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

233
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,446
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

234
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,720
You are crazy.

235
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,696
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

236
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,010
We can just...

237
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

238
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,060
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

239
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,560
Steve... I have to study.

240
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm not kidding.

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,730
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

242
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,490
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

243
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,120
[sighs]

244
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,040
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

245
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,250
To study.

246
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,420
[bell ringing]

247
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,760
Good of you to show.

248
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,520
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

249
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,270
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

250
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,416
- Oh, yeah?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

251
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,040
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

252
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,070
[officers laughing]

253
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,690
While you were drinking or sleeping,

254
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,740
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

255
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Phil Larson called.

256
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,580
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

257
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,120
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

258
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

259
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,080
On a more pressing matter,

260
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,210
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

261
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,050
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

262
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,340
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

263
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,300
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

264
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,720
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

265
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,680
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

266
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,940
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

267
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,610
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

268
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,070
I'm going out of my mind!

269
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,740
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

270
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,830
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

271
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,516
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

272
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,306
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

273
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,976
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,670
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

275
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,710
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

276
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,300
He's not like... most.

277
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,260
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

278
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,180
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

279
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,310
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

280
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,350
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

281
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,730
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

282
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,860
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

283
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,650
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

284
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,070
[softy] Called him a fag.

285
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,070
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

286
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,950
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

287
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,080
[scoffs]

288
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,420
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

289
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,316
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

290
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,276
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

291
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,510
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

292
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,720
the kid is with a parent or relative.

293
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,310
[stammers] What about the other time?

294
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,730
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

295
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,850
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

296
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,060
The one!

297
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,980
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
- [sighs]

298
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,876
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

299
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,046
in the four years I've been working here?

300
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,296
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

301
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,450
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

302
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,250
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

303
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,990
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

304
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,790
He will talk to me before he talks to...

305
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,830
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

306
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,920
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,880
Find him!

308
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,640
[man] Dr. Brenner.

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,270
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

310
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,190
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

311
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,110
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

312

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,930
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

320
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,010
[man 1] And the girl?

321
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,760
She can't have gone far.

322
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,600

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,740
[Ben] All right, and one more.

325
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,676
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

326
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,240
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

327
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,660
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average...

328
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,620
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

[indistinct chatter]

330
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,110
Hey!

331
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,320
Come here!

332
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,360
Hey, come here!

333
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,080
You think you can steal from me, boy?

334
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,750
What in the hell?

335
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,130
- [bell ringing]
- [Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

336
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,010
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

337
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,220
and other forms of science investigation.

338
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,180
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

339
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,310
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

340
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,350
So, did it come?

341
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,810
Sorry, boys.

342
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,770
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

343
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
it came.

344
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,490
Yes!

345
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,360
The Heathkit ham shack.

346
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,966
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

347
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,030
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

348
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,290
Think bigger.

349
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,370
- California?
- Bigger.

350
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,830
Australia?

351
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,370
- [boys exclaiming]
- [Lucas] Oh, man!

352
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,340
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

353
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,500
Lucas!

354
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,960
- Sorry.

Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

357
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,720
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

358
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,470
[Lucas] What are you doing?

359
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,786
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

360
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,810
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

361
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,060
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

362
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,150
- [Mike laughs]
- [knock on door]

363
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,070
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

364
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,820
[overlapping chatter]

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,620
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,660
One at a time, all right?
You.

367
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,380
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

368
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,040
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,630
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

370
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,510
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

371
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,470
- Well, <i>The Hobbit.</i>
- It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,390
- He asked!
- [mockingly] "He asked!"

373
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,060
- [Mike] Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,100
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

375
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,480
One at a damn time.
You.

376
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,770
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

377
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,296
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

378
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,876
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

379
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,240
I said that I know it!

380
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

381
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
- No.
- [boys clamoring]

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,450
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

383
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,750
Immediately.

384
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,620
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

385
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,790
no nonsense.

386
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,840
This isn't some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> book.

387
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,710
<i>- The Hobbit.</i>
- Shut up!

388
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,170
- Hey!
- [Mike] Stop it!

389
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,380
[boys bickering]

390
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,390
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

391
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,150
Do I make myself... clear?

392
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,940
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

393
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,490
Ring-a-ding-ding!

394
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,290
Anybody home?

395
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,000
[Will] Password?

396
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,040
Uh, Rada...

397
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,880
[stammering] Radaga... Radagast?

398
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,380
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

399
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,930
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,550
So, guess what?

401
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,100
I got off early and...

402
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,850
Ta-da!
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

403
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,536
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

404
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,940
I changed my mind.

405
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,860
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

406
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,400
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

407
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,490
Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,240
Not even of clowns?

409
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,400
No.

410
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,870
What about my witch?

411
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,370
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

412
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,290
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

413
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,970
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

414
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,120
[sighs]

415
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,290
[Jonathan] Will?

416
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,960
- [shouting] Will?
- Will?

417
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,760
Will?

418
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,300
- Will?
- Will!

419
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,100
- [Jonathan] Will!
- Will?

420
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,720
[Joyce] Will!

421
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,480
Where are you?

422
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,070
Geez.

423
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,700
Your parents forget to feed you?

424
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,200
Is that why you ran away?

425
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,870
They, uh...

426
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,040
They hurt you?

427
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,630
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

428
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,390
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

429
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,640
All right.

430
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,850
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

431
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,960
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

432
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,380
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

433
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,440
We got a deal?

434
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,070
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

435
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,530
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

436
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,330
See? Like this. Here.

437
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,330
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

438
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

439
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,000
[sighing]

440
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,260
[sighs]

441
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
Eleven?

442
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,600
What's that mean?

443
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,220
What's it mean?

444
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,560
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

445
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,350
She speaks.

446
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,110
"No"? No, what?

447
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,900
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

448
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,150
Eleven.

449
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,570
Yeah.

450
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,450
What's it mean?

451
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,620
Eleven.

452
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,500
All right, then.

453
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,330
[chuckles] Here you go.

454
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,170
Take it easy, take it easy.

455
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,460
[sighs]

456
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,170
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

457
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,380
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

458
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,090
kidnapped or something.

459
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,180
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

460
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,730
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

461
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,610
[fan rattling]

462
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,490
[rattling continues]

463
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,450
[rattling intensifies]

464
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,380
[Callahan] Will Byers?

465
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,550
[Powell yelling] Will!

466
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,060
[Callahan] Will Byers?

467
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,680
[hooting]

468
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,060
Come on, kid!

469
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,400
[Powell] Will?

470
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,320
- [Powell whistles]
- Hey! I got something.

471
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,290
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

472
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,340
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

All right.
You just sit tight.

628
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,220
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

629
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,100
- [knocking continues]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

630
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,730
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

631
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,126
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

632
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,900
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

633
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,860
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

634
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,780
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

635
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,176
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

636
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,160
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

637
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,880
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

638
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,300
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

639
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,210
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

640
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,100
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

641
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,276
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

Hey, guys.
You feel that?

00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,770
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

653
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,480
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

654
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,690
Come on.

655
