Mike. <font color="#ff00ff">[gasps]</font>

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,760
Is that...

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,390
I never gave up on you.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,360
I called you every night.
Every night for...

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,900
353 days.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,990
I heard.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,450
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,890
- That you were okay?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Because I wouldn't let her.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,830
- The hell is this? Where you been?
- Where have you been?

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,790
You've been hiding her.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,550
- You've been hiding her this whole time!
- Hey!

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,630
Let's talk.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,630
Alone.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,310
- Protecting her! Protecting her?
- Listen. Listen to me.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,690
The more people know about her,
the more danger she's in.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,980
And the more danger
you and your family are in...

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,360
So I should be thanking you?

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm not asking you to thank me!
I'm asking you to try to understand.

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,440
I don't! I don't understand!

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,360
That's fine. That's fine!
Just do not blame her!

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,320
All right? She's upset enough as it is.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,790
I don't blame her! I blame you!
I blame you!

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,080
That's okay, kid. That's okay.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,290
No! Nothing about this is okay!

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,920
- Nothing about this is okay!
- Oh, jeez...

Will's a part of that army.

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,350

If this is a virus,
and Will's the host, then...

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Then we need
to make the host uninhabitable.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,510
<font color="#ff00ff">[Nancy]</font> So if he likes it cold...

That's all.

156
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,070
To see Mama.

157
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,200
Okay.

158
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,710
- How'd you get there?
- A truck.

159
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,830
A truck?

160
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,460
A big truck.

161
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,000
A big truck? Whose truck was it?

162
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,920
- A man's.
- A man's?

163
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,460
A nice man.

164
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
Okay. So let me just
get this straight in my head.

165
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,060
So a nice man in a big truck,

166
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,180
he drove you to your mama's,
and then what?

167
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,060
Your Aunt Becky gave you
those clothes and that makeup?

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
I...

169
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,650
I shouldn't have left.

170
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,150
Mmm-mmm.

171
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,950
No.

172
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,740
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.

173
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,210
I should never have lied to you
about your mom.

174
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,540
Or about when you could leave.

175
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,540
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.

176
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,380
Sometimes I feel like I'm...

177
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,430
<font color="#ff00ff">[inhales sharply]</font>

178
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,770
Like I'm just some kind of black hole
or something. <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

179
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,980
A black hole?

180
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,770
Yeah, it's a...
You know, it's this thing in outer space.

181
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,610
It's like, it sucks everything towards it
and destroys it.

182
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,650
Sarah had a picture book
about outer space. She loved it.

183
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,780
Who's Sarah?

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,370
Sarah?

185
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,250
Sarah's my girl.

186
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,920
She's my little girl.

187
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,420
Where is she?

188
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,130
Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh...

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,140
She left us.

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,890
- Gone.
- Yeah.

191
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,310
The black hole. It got her.

192
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,570
And somehow...

193
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
I've just been scared, you know?

194
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,120
I've just been scared
that it would take you, too.

195
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,830
I think that's why I get...

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,500
so mad.

197
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm so sorry.

198
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,880
For everything.

199
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,840
I could be so... so...

200
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,180
Stupid?

201
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckling]</font> Yeah. Stupid.

202
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,390
- <font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font>
- Just really stupid.

203
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,070
I've been stupid, too.

204
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,740
I guess we broke our rule.

205
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,910
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles softly]</font>

206
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't hate it, by the way.

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,290
This whole...

208
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
look.

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
It's kinda cool.

210
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,300
Bitchin'.

211
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,140
Okay. Sure.

212
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,770
- Bitchin'.

<font color="#ff00ff">[monster roaring in distance]</font>

214
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,460
All right.

215
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,880
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> It should fit now.

216
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Is this really necessary?

217
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,930
Yes, it is, okay? This is
a ground-breaking scientific discovery.

218
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,350
We can't just bury it like
some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.

219
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,140
All right, all right, all right.

220
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,020
But you're explaining this to Mrs. Byers,
all right?

221
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,150
Christ. Help me out.

222
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get the door, man.

223
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,940
All right, I got the door.

224
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,360
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

225

00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,950
Phew!

227
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,550
Mike, would you just stop already?

228
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,170
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

229
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,590
That lab is swarming
with hundreds of those dogs.

230
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
- Demo-dogs!
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> The chief will take care of her.

231
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,140
Like she needs protection.

232
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,010
Listen, dude,
a coach calls a play in a game,

233
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,680
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

234
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,980
Okay, first of all,
this isn't some stupid sports game.

235
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,650
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.

236
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,110
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> So my point is...

237
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,820
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

238
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,120
That's not entirely true.

239
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,370
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

240
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,750
When they ran away from the bus,
they were called away.

241
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,430
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

242
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,830
Clear a path to the gate.

243
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,250
Yeah, and then we all die.

244
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,340
That's one point of view.

245
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,460
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.

246
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,880
I got it!

247
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,220
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

248
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,510
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

249
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,470
So you got all the tunnels
feeding in here.

250
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,100
Maybe if we set this on fire...

251
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,230
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

252
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,000
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

253
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,250
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

254
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,210
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

255
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,650
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

256
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,800
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

257
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,740
No buts. I promised
I'd keep you shitheads safe,

258
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,280
and that's exactly what I plan on.

259
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,240
We're staying here. On the bench.

260
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,540
And we're waiting for the starting team
to do their job.

261
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Does everybody understand?

262
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,370
This isn't a stupid sports game.

263
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
I said does everybody understand that?

264
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,920
I need a yes.

all day.

And then I find her with you
in a stranger's house.

to stay away from him, Max.

to an experimental chemical asphyxiant,

which had leaked
from the grounds of the lab.

We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins

they thought they lived in a safe town.

The kind of town where,
they say, nothing ever happens.
