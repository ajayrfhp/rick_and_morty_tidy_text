- I believe there was, and may still be,

123
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,830
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

124

Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens?
Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.

126
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay?

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

128
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,680
- A child? What are you talking about?
- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

129
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,180
- "Psionic"?
- Psychic.

130
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,350
What about that girl
that made that kid pee himself?

131
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,310
- A prank.
- What girl?

132
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,710
- Wasn't a prank.

134
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,730
<font color="#ff00ff">[Murray]</font>
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

135
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,610
who said some little girl
shattered the door with her mind.

136
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,570
I heard that story.

137
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,780
Did you hear the one about the fat man
with the beard who climbs down chimneys?

138
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,370
<font color="#ff00ff">[Murray]</font> Then last month,
a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims

139
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,910
some Russian girl with a shaved head
was hiding in his basement.

140
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,240
Ted now denies this.

141
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,870
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
- But it connects.

142
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,370
- Enlighten me.
- This girl,

143
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,040
she's some kind
of a Russian weapon, right?

144
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,170
Barbara sees this girl,
tries to help her, perhaps.

145
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,130
But before she can,
the Russians find them, take them...

146
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,260
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland
was kidnapped by Russian spies.

147
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,890
- Kidnapped. Killed.
- Killed?

148
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,390
- Don't you get it, Jim?
- No.

149
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,520
This has potentially
international implications.

150
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,150
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion
right here in Hawkins.

151
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,020
<font color="#ff00ff">[whirring]</font>

152
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you have any proof of this girl?
I mean, has anybody seen her recently?

153
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,590
- These are separate...
- <font color="#ff00ff">[phone rings]</font>

154
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,820
Excuse me. Sorry.

155
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,030
- Okay.
- Hello?

156
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,740
Merrill called,
wants you to check out his pumpkins.

157
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,290
- Says they've been contaminated...
- All right.

158
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,000
...by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this,
but I gotta run.

160
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,550
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.

161
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,310
Yeah, listen, you know what?
I liked your alien theory a lot better.

162
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,930
And you want my advice?

163
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,100
Why don't you stop bleeding
those people dry and go home? All right?

164
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,100
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.
- Listen to me. Go home.

165
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,730
It's crap, I know.

166
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,360
No, it's not crap.

167
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,410
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.

168
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,250
- Just... It needs some reorganizing.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font>

169
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,160
- Can I mark on it?
- Yeah, I guess.

170
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,870
So, in the first paragraph,

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,960
you used the basketball game
versus Northern

172
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,670
as a metaphor for your life,
which is great.

173
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,300
But then, around here,

174
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,430
you start talking about your granddad's
experiences in the war.

175
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,720
And I... <font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font>
I don't see how they're connected.

176
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,220
It connects because...

177
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,640
because, you know, we both won.

178
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,110
- Do you think I should start from scratch?
- No. I mean...

179
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,990
When's the deadline?

180
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,910
It's tomorrow for early application.

181
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,240
Can you come and help me tonight?

182
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,620
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

183
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,160
- Oh, my God!
- We already canceled last week.

184
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,630
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.
- No, no, no. What's the point?

185
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,960
- Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

186
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,760
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...

187
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,380
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.

188
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,270
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing?

189
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,060
There's insurance and benefits
and all that adult stuff.

190
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,480
And if I took it, you know,
I could be around for your senior year.

191
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,690
- Steve...
- Just to look after you a little bit.

192
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,780
Make sure you don't forget
about this pretty face.

193
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,240
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font>

194
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,740
Nance, I'm serious.

195
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,160
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

196
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,040
<font color="#ff00ff">[car engine revving]</font>

197
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,170
<font color="#ff00ff">[tires screeching]</font>

198
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,410
Who is that?

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,670
I have no idea.

200
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,130
But would you check out that ass?

201
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,590
Just look at it go.

202

<font color="#ff00ff">[giggles]</font>

<font color="#ff00ff">[bell ringing]</font>

204
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,200
Meet the human brain.

205
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,620
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.

206
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,540
A little gross even, right?
But consider this.

207
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,080
There are a hundred billion cells
inside of this miracle of evolution.

208
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,580
All working as one.

209
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,380
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.

210
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,880
A hundred billion.

211
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,130
- <font color="#ff00ff">[door closes]</font>
- Ah, this must be our new student.

212
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,590
<font color="#ff00ff">[principal]</font> Indeed. All yours.

213
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,140
All right. Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.

214
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,770
Come on up. Don't be shy.

215
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,890
Dustin, drum roll.

216
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,110
Class, please welcome,
all the way from sunny California,

217
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,110
the latest passenger to join us
on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

218
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,320
- It's Max.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mr. Clarke]</font> Sorry?

219
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,030
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

220
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,950
- <font color="#ff00ff">[whispers]</font> Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.

221
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,220
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

222
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,770
Do you have these in any other colors?
I'm not a big fan of orange.

223
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,230
Hmm...

224
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,520
I'll have to check in back.

225
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,650
Oh, shit!

226
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,120
- You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.

227
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,880
Get you fired so I can hire you
and we won't have to hide back here.

228
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,960
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,840
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.

230
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,340
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.

231
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,920
You know, in high school,
you didn't know who I was.

232
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,880
Come on. <font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font>

233
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,850
Bob, I have to get back to work.

234
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,180
Okay.

235
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,600
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,
and I'll see you tonight for movie night.

236
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,940
Jonathan's night to pick?

237
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,310
- Yes.
- Okay.

238
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,330
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

239
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,200
Hey, look, a green one.

240
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,540
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.

241
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,230
<font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> You're saying
this was fine yesterday?

242
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,310
<font color="#ff00ff">[Merrill]</font> Fine?

243
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,270
These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.

244
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,730
For the life of me,
I couldn't figure out what happened.

245
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,030
And then I remembered... Eugene.

246
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
What about him?

247
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,920
He's been complaining about me
to just about anyone who'll listen.

248
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,660
Why's that?

249
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,870
Well, he started this
"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

250
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,500
Acted like it was trademarked.

251
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,710
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you."

252
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,750
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

253
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,430
came out here after dark
and doused your field with poison?

254
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,640
Not Eugene himself.

255
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,680
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.

256
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,230
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around
accusations lightly. You know me.

257
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,600
This happening the day before Halloween,
when sales are peaking?

258
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,190
That's a hell of a coincidence.

259
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,530
- Hell of a coincidence.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[flies buzzing]</font>

260
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,070
You got somebody working on that field?

- Hey! Thanks.

- Oh, could I get one more?
- Yeah, sure.

You're coming to this.

"Come and get sheet faced."

271
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,470
No, I'm not.

272
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,310
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.

273
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,100
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.

274
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

275
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,730
- All night?
- Yeah.

276
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,490
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:{c}00,

277
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,990
listening to the Talking Heads
and reading Vonnegut or something.

278
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,620
Sounds like a nice night.

279
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,080
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,
you might even, like, meet someone.

- I missed you.

282
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,470
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.

283
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,100
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

284
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
<font color="#ff00ff">[Steve]</font> Sorry.

285
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,950
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

286
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,530
And even if they did,
you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug.

287
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,790
- It's impossible.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> But her name is Max.

288
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,660
- So what?
- So, how many Maxes do you know?

289
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,960
- I don't know.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> Zero. That's how many.

290
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,210
She shows up at school

291
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,170
the day after someone with her same name
breaks our top score.

292
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,130
- I mean, you kidding me?
- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

293
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,550
And plus she skateboards,
so she's pretty awesome.

294
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,100
Awesome?
You haven't even spoken a word to her.

295
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,180
I don't have to. I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.

296
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,810
Oh! There.

297
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,490
Got it. There we go.

when he has to go in.

305
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,160
He's always quiet.

306
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,810
You feeling any better?

307
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,310

308
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,520
Huh? <font color="#ff00ff">[mumbles]</font>

309
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,070
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

310
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,530
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?
You've got to stop it with the sorries.

311
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,280
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

312
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,040
And listen, you know, there's nothing
to be nervous about, you know.

313
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,920
Just tell 'em what you felt last night
and what you saw.

314
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,550
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

315
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,630
Okay.

316
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,360
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

320
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
Sir Will, how are you?

321
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,830
Mom. Pop.

322
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,540
Let's take a look,
see what's going on here.

323
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,170
I see you shaved off a pound
since we saw you last.

324
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,010
Must be making room
for all that Halloween candy.

325
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,220
What's your favorite candy?

326
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,850
Desert island candy,
if you had to pick one?

327
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,390
- I don't know.
- Come on.

328
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,390
Life or death situation,
what would you pick?

329
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,980
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[mouthing]</font> Reese's Pieces.

330
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,810
Good call. Good call.

331
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,190
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

332
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,490
but I gotta say, peanut butter
and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

333
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,400
All right, tell me
what's going on with you.

334
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,160
Tell me about this episode you had.

335
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,660
<font color="#ff00ff">[Will]</font> Well, my friends were there
and then they just weren't,

336
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,410
and I was back there again.

337
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,290
In the Upside Down?

338
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,420
All right, so what happened next?

339
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,010
I heard this noise, and so I went outside,
and it was worse.

340
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,340
How was it worse?

341
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,300
There was this storm.

342
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[thunder crashing]</font>

343
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,020
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

344
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
I felt...

345
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,150
frozen.

346
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,320
- Heart racing?
- Just frozen.

347
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,410
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

348
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,490
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,

349
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,960
and you can't breathe or talk
or do anything.

350
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,040
I felt... felt this evil,
like it was looking at me.

351
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,800
It was evil?

352
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,090
Well... <font color="#ff00ff">[clears throat]</font>
What do you think the evil wanted?

353
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,430
To kill.

354
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,220
<font color="#ff00ff">[whirring rapidly]</font>

355
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,800
To kill you?

356
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,430
Not me.

357
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,310
Everyone else.

358
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,370
<font color="#ff00ff">[Owens]</font> All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

359
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,370
It's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

360
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,160
Worse? He's already had
two episodes this month.

361
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,790
He'll likely have more
before the month is out.

362
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,590
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.

363
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,090
The anniversary of an event brings back
traumatic memories.

364
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,640
Sort of opens up
the neurological floodgates, so to speak.

365
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,350
So what does this mean for the kid?

366
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,310
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?

367
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,310
Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.

368
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,060
He might get irritable. He might lash out.

369
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,560
What do we do when that happens?

370
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,030
Okay. Well, from what we know
about post-traumatic stress...

371
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,900
And we're still learning, okay?
Just treat him normally.

372
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,490
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.

373
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,990
Just let him lead the way.

374
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,290
I'm sorry, what you're saying
is it's gonna get worse and worse

375
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,580
and we're just supposed to pretend
it's not happening?

376
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,330
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

377
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,800
But I assure you that is really
the best thing you can do for him.

378
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,600
Listen. I understand what you went through
last year. I get it.

379
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,310
But those people are gone.
They're gone. Okay?

380
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,520
So if we're gonna get through this,

381
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,810
I just... I need you to realize
I'm on your side.

382
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,610
I need you to trust me.

383
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,240
<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> "Trust me"?

384
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
- Are you kidding me?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Yeah, I know.

385
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,160
But, you know, university gives out
a degree, this guy's got it.

386
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,250
And look, that post-traumatic stuff
he's talking about, that stuff is real.

387
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,830
He's gonna be okay. All right?

388
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,130
How's Bob the Brain?

389
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,300
Don't call him that.

390
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,880
Sorry. Old habit.

391
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,510
He's good. We're good.

392
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,680
Good. I'm happy for you.

393
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,850
Really. Hey...

394
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,850
Things get worse, you call me first.

395
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
You call me.

396
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060

out of here so you can make your move.

418
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,310
After dinner, I want you to pick out
your toys for the yard sale.

419
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,140
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.

420
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,020
- Two boxes?
- You heard me.

421
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

422
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,060
but the other ones have
way too much emotional value.

423
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,730
- Emotional value?
- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

424
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,070
You already took away my Atari.

425
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,750
Didn't wanna lose more toys,
you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

426
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,240
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

427
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,920
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski
last week either, right?

428
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,540
Or plagiarize that essay?
Or graffiti the bathroom stall?

429
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,330
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

430
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,000
So if your friend jumps off a cliff,
you're gonna jump, too?

431
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,880
We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.

432
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,670
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.

433
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,300
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.

434
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,140
And if it'd been my coach,
you'd be lucky to still be on the team.

435
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,310

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,760
- It's fine. It's great.
- Right. I love KFC.

445
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,600
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign
out in your yard.

446
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,220
Is that the neighbors', or...

447
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,810
- You wanna tell them?
- Go ahead.

448
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,940
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him?

449
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,190
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

450
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,820
He was an investigative journalist
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

451
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,200
He's pretty well known.

452
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,830
Anyway, he's freelance now,
and he agreed to take the case.

453
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,870
That's... That's great.

454
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,880
No, that's really... That's great, right?

455
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,420
Um, what exactly does that mean?

456
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,470
Means he's gonna do
what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...

457
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Sorry.

458
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,930
<font color="#ff00ff">[exhales]</font>

459
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,520
What the Hawkins police haven't been
capable of doing.

460
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,480
Means we have a real detective
on the case.

461
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
It means...

462
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,440
we're going to find our Barb.

463
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,110
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

464
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,620
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.

465
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,950
Is that why you're selling the house?

466
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,460
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.

467
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,330
More than fine.

468
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,250
For the first time in a long time,
we're hopeful.

469

<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> Excuse me. I'll be right back.

478
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,210
I'm still here.

479
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,630
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.

480
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,470
I won't even say anything.
Just... I wanna know if you're okay.

00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,200
Yeah, it's me, Dustin.
What're you doing on this channel again?

486
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,700

We were right. Max is Mad Max.

487
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,240

- But...

- We stick to the plan.

489
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,870
Mike's not gonna like it.

490
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,080
Last time I checked,
our party is not a dictatorship.

491
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,210
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no?

492
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,090

what you'd like, so I got a variety.

504
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,660
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.

505
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,910
All right.

506
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,540
What are you working on?

507
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,120
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

508
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,500
- Me.
- Did someone call you that?

509
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,760
Hey. You can talk to me.
You know that, right?

510
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,590
Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.

511
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,640
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what?

512
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,100
Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.

513
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,930
What are you talking about?

514
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,270
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

515
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,400
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

516
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,070
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.

517
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,400
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel
like more of a freak.

518
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,660
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.

519
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,580
I am.

520
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,580
You know what? You're right.

521
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,500
You are a freak.

522
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,800
- What?
- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

523
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,510
But what? Do you wanna be normal?
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

524
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,720
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

525
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,010
Is that why you don't have any friends?

526
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,230
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font> I have friends, Will.

527
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,440
Then why are you
always hanging out with me?

528
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,110
Because you're my best friend, all right?

529
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,280
And I would rather be best friends
with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

You know what I mean?

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,910
Okay, look...

532
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,410
Who would you rather be friends with?
Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

533
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,700
Ugh.

534
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,960
Exactly. It's no contest.

The thing is, nobody normal

in this world.

- Well...

- Kenny Rogers.
