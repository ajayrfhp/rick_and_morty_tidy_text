151
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,900
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> I didn't bring
regular clothes. You?

152
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,850
<font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> No.

153
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,730
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this. It's now or never.

154
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,980
- Right. <font color="#ff00ff">[sniffs]</font>
- Let's engage.

155
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,860
We could ask her after class.

156
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,110
- Yup.
- Okay.

157
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,410
<font color="#ff00ff">[Joyce]</font> See? It's an exact match.

158
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,090
- But... why would he lie to me?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[inhales deeply]</font> He's a kid, Joyce.

159
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,550
I mean, you heard him
describe these episodes.

160
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,590
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.

161
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,970
Yeah, because they're not nightmares,
they're flashbacks.

162
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,640
I know a couple guys
who have had these things,

163
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,690
and it feels like you're there,
like it's happening.

164
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,820
- Then what the hell is this?
- Owens said it would get worse.

165
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,420
- That place...
- What do you wanna do?

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,030
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

167
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,110
Well, there's that guy in Boston
that's supposed to be...

168
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,530
They're all a bunch of quacks.

169
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,240
They'll all tell you the same thing,
just cost you more money.

170
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,080
I think he's right... about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

171
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,960
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you... Will most of all.

172
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,430
I think we just gotta get through
the next few weeks.

175
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,140
Nothing's gonna go back
to the way that it was.

176
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,730
Not really.

177
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,190
But it'll get better.

178
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,360
In time.

- Fifth and sixth period.

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,750
Yeah, under the steps.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,970
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?

189
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,470
He was like,
<font color="#ff00ff">[gruffly]</font> "Hey, assholes."

190
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,390

What's going on? Are you okay?

- I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

- Pretending like everything's okay.

It's like everyone forgot.

It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.

223
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,620
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance...

224
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,790
And they're going to spend
the rest of their lives looking for her.

225
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,330
- I know.
- It's destroying them.

226
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,420
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,
there's nothing we can do about it.

227
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,130
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

228
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,930
- Well, you know that we can't do that.
- We don't have to tell them everything.

229
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,720
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any...

230
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,230
They could put us in jail. Okay?
Or worse, they could destroy our families.

231
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,030
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.

that we've been working on
for a stupid amount of time,

239
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,970
and just pretend
like we're stupid teenagers, okay?

240
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,850
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,850
No, we were just concerned because,
you know, you're new and all.

Yeah, for your safety.

- Yeah.

- Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
- Well, these don't function. But...

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,910
I do have this
handy-dandy little trap here.

No? Okay. But, um...

261
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,500
So, we were talking last night,
and you're new here,

262
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,340
so you probably don't have any friends
to take you trick-or-treating,

263
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,470
and you're scared of bullies,
so we were thinking

264
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,760
that it would be okay if you come with us.

265
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,010
- "It'd be okay"?
- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

266
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,460
the majority voted you could come.

267
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,240
Didn't realize it was such an honor
to go trick-or-treating with you.

268
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,190
We know where to get
the full-sized candy bars.

269
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,610
We figured you'd want in.

270
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,270
That's presumptuous of you.

271
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,450
Yeah. Totally.
Uh, so, um... you'll come?

272
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,660
We're meeting
at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:{c}00.

So, you're telling me that
Merrill poisoned your farm,

307
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,090
because he thinks you poisoned his,
which, of course, you didn't?

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,340
No, sir. And I got me an alibi
the night he accuses me.

309
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,050
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.

- Did you actually see Merrill?
- No need. That man done lost his mind.

threatening all sorts of madness.

when it gets, like...

609
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
- Caught between two slides?
- Yeah. Like that.

610
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,340
Like one side's our world,
and the other...

611
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,550
The other slide is the Upside Down.

612
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,430
And...

613
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,930
And there was this noise
coming from everywhere.

614
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,730
And then I saw something.

615
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,280
- The Demogorgon?
- No.

616
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,410
It was like this huge shadow in the sky.

617
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,790
Only, it was alive.

618

And it was coming for me.

619
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,170
Is this all real?

620
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,050
Or is it like the doctors say,
all in your head?

621
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,010
I don't know. Just...

622
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,970
Just please don't tell the others, okay?

623
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,640
They won't understand.

624
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,270

Yeah.

627
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,900
She always did.

628
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,870
Sometimes I feel like I still see her.

629
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,170
Like she's still around, but she never is.

630
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.
