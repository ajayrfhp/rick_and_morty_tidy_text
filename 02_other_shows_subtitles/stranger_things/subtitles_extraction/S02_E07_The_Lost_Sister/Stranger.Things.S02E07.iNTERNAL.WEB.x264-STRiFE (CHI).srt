he can work out some sort of deal

he also stops you from using your gifts?

Wait.

136

- Do you have a gift?
- Different.

137
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,320
I can make people see, or not see,
whatever I choose.

138
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,360
Is that why you made the man
with the crazy hair dance?

139
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,540
- Axel is not so fond of spiders, so...
- You made him see spiders?

140
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,750
But it doesn't have to be scary.

141

This butterfly, it isn't real.

If you're looking for a number,
you won't find one.

209

They're not like us.

No, not in that way.
But like us, they're outcasts.

Outcasts?

- Freaks.
- Speak for yourself.

213

hurt them, discarded them.

214

We were dead, all of us.

215

No, not mushy. True.

Now we help her.

219
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,590
In this life, kid,
you roll over or you fight back.

220

We're all fighters here.

221
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,640
Fight who?

222
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,140
Everyone you see here was
in some way responsible

223
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,350
for what happened to us.

224
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,820
You hurt the bad men?

225
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.

226
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,580
You kill them?

227
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,250
They're criminals.
We simply make them pay for their crimes.

228
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,000
Boom.

229
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,250

You look like you've seen a ghost.

230
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,300
We can't all be fighters, I guess.

231
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,050
I'm a fighter. I've killed.

232
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,810
These men you killed, did they deserve it?

233

- They hurt me.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font>

234
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,940
And they still want to hurt you.
To hurt us.

We're just making the first move.

I was just like you once.

238
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,330
I kept my anger inside.

239
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,080
I tried to hide from it,
but then that pain festered.

240
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,670
Festered?

241
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,800
It spread.

242
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,050
Until finally I confronted my pain,
and I began to heal.

243

- Yes.

Yes.

00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,730
The bad men were trying
to take you again,

250
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,440
and that made you angry.

251
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,950
Good. So, find that anger,

252

focus on that, not the train,
not its weight.

from your life.

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,510
We're only stealing from the war criminal
billionaires who own this place.

315
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,010
- You won't even lose a dime.
- I said stay back.

316
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,680
We're on the same side.

317
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,560
- I promise.
- Stay back.

318

319
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
- Damn, Shirley.

320
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,950
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

321
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,660
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!

322
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,520
We should case the place,
stick to the routine. We have time.

323
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,320
We also have her. Can you look?

324
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
- He's watching television.
- Is he alone?

325
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,130
I saw him. No one else.

326
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,420
- Good enough for me.
- Me, too.

327
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,420
Let's do this.

328
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,210
- Keep it running.
- Meet you around back.

329

331
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,530
Punky, what's the matter?

332
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,610
A nightmare.

333
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,660
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.

334
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,870
All of a sudden, he's started to give me
my shot in my arm.

335
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,120
Then the needle got bigger
and bigger and bigger...

<font color="#ff00ff">[Funshine]</font> Sit down. Please.

340
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,610
- I said sit.
- Please...

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,990
Just, please... just take what you want.

Where's your wallet?

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,700
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.
- Come on.

00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,830
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dottie]</font> Yes.

00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,580
<font color="#ff00ff">[Axel]</font> Got it.

347
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,980
Do you remember us?

348
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,240
What about us?
Do you remember us, Ray?

351
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,370
You hurt Mama.

354
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,380
<font color="#ff00ff">[shakily]</font> Please. Listen...

355
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,220
I just did what he told me to do.

356
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,560
He said she was sick.

357
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,930
You had a choice, Ray.

358
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,810
And you chose to follow a man
you knew was evil.

359
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,480
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

360
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,190
I can help. I can help you find him.

361
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,610
- Find who?
- Brenner!

362
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,200
I can take you to him.

363
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,530
Papa is gone.

364
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,580
No, he is alive.

365
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,250
Do not lie to us, Ray.

366
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,790
I'm not lying!

367
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,380
<font color="#ff00ff">[softly]</font> I swear... <font color="#ff00ff">[whimpering]</font>

368
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,540
He trusts me.

369
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,090
I'll take you to him.

370
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,010
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

371
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,840
Just as she found you.

372
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,510
Do it, Jane.

373
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,640
- Do it.
- Wait.

Not too quick.

376
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,280
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

377
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,180
<font color="#ff00ff">[woman over phone]</font>

- What's wrong?
- We got a problem.

383
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,810

<font color="#ff00ff">[Ray]</font> Please...

385
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,570

386
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,370
- I'm sorry.
- He took her from you, without hesitation.

Please don't. Please.

If you wanted to show mercy,
that is your choice.

401
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,290
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

402
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,250

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,730
That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.

00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,030
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dottie]</font> I think you're full of shit.

00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,300
May I sit?

410
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,770
I was once just like you, you know that?

411
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,440
But that's why I'm hard on you,
because I see in you my past mistakes.

412
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
They were kids.

413
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,410
Does that excuse that man's sins?
Were we not also children?

414
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,790
I remember the day I came
to the rainbow room and you were gone.

415
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,420
So, when my gifts were strong enough,
I used them to escape.

416
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,630
And I ran.

417
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,750
I ran away as far as I could.

418
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,800
And it was there, far away,
that I found a place to hide.

419
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,640
A family.

420
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
A home.

421
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,650
Just like you and your policeman.

422
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
But they couldn't help me.

423
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

424
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
So, I decided to play the part.

425
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,660
To stop hiding.

426
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,540
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.

427
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,290
You're now faced
with the same choice, Jane.

428
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,920
Go back into hiding
and hope they don't find you.

429
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,880
Fight, and face them again.

430
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,220
Face who?

431
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,550
The man who calls himself our father.

432
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,850
Papa is dead.

433
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,570
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dr. Brenner]</font> That man tonight disagreed.

434

You're not real.

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,820
All this time?
And you haven't looked for me?

436
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Why?

437
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,330
Because you thought I was dead?

438
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,620
Or because you were afraid
of what you might find?

439
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
Go away.

440
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,250
You have to confront your pain.

441
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,670
You have a wound, Eleven,
a terrible wound.

442
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,090
And it's festering.

443
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,350
Do you remember
what that means? Festering?

444
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,100
It means a rot.

445
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,060
And it will grow.

- And eventually, it will kill you.

448
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,240
<font color="#ff00ff">[screaming]</font> Get out of my head!

450
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,210
This isn't a prison, Jane.

451
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,470
You're always free
to return to your policeman.

452
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,720
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

453
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,640
Let us heal our wounds together.

454
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,370
- <font color="#ff00ff">[laughs]</font> Full house.
- Screw this. I'm out.

455
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,960
- Out of money, you mean. You are broke!
- <font color="#ff00ff">[laughing]</font>

456
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,630
- You want in, Mick?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font> Nope.

457
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,090
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.

458
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,340
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dottie]</font> How am I the worst?

459
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,550
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

460
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,140
two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,020
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dottie]</font> Are you in or out?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mick]</font> Out.

462
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,520
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

463
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,710
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

464
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,550
You'd better run!

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,760
You saved me, you understand?
You saved me.

467
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[Eleven]</font> Compromise?

468
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,020
<font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> It's something that's kind of
in between. Like halfway happy.

469
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,440
Once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice. Real nice.

This is your new home.

I need to get through. It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.

Mike!

Mike! Mike, where are you?

<font color="#ff00ff">[officer]</font> Don't move!

Come on, hurry!

Do something!

Jane, get in.

00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,560
It's a damn graveyard.

- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

499
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,530
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I have to go back.

500
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,030
My friends... My friends are in danger.

501
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,120
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now!

502
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,000
Your mother sent you here
for a reason, remember?

503
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,500
We belong together.

504
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,330
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.

505
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,170
No.

506
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,800
But I can save them.

507
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,890
Jane. Jane!

Jane!

The hell was that? What's wrong with her?

<font color="#ff00ff">[woman]</font> You all right, sweetie?

512
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,810
You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you?

513
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Hmm.

514
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,250
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> You are awfully young
to be traveling alone, aren't you?

515
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,080
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

516
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,760
So, where are you headed?

517
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,880
To your parents, I hope?

518
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,510
I'm going to my friends.

519
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,140
I'm going home.
