<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> How was what?

00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,070
"How was what?"
The greatest night of the year, of course.

5
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,740
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was...
It was, uh, tubular.

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,530
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,700
- Did something happen?
- No. What? No.

No. Mom!

15

a motor to make it look like
I caught a ghost.

16

You're gonna see him. Soon.

- You now say "soon" on day 326?

94
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,710

95

However...

98
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,720
I am on a curiosity voyage,
and I need my paddles to travel.

99

These books...

100
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,190
These books are my paddles.

101
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,060
Five at a time.

102

- Are you shitting me?
- Excuse me?

103

104
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,030
- Mr. Henderson!
- I need my paddles!

105
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,250
Was that you I heard milling around
last night, or was that a ghost?

106
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah. Me, probably.

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,720
- Another nightmare?
- Um... no.

108
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,350
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?

109
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,100
- Mr. Baldo?
- Yeah.

110
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,520
I was a little younger than you,

111
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,190
standing in line for the Ferris wheel
at the Roane County fair.

112
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,020
- Mmm-hmm.
- And suddenly,

113
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,820
I feel this fat white glove
tap me on the shoulder.

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,150
I spin around, and there he is.

115
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Mr. Baldo.

116
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,370
<font color="#ff00ff">[imitating clown]</font>
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"

118

It wasn't funny back then,
I can tell you that.

119
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,380
I couldn't get him out of my head.

120
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,460
Every night, he would come
to me in my dreams.

121
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,170
And every night when he came to me...

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I ran.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,050
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> It got so bad that I made
my mom stay in the room with me

124
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
until I could fall asleep every night.

125
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,390
- Really?
- Really.

126
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,890
It went on like that for months.

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,320
And then one day,
the nightmares suddenly stopped.

128
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,030
- Wanna know how?
- How?

129
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,160
Well, I fell asleep...

130
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,370
and just like always,
Mr. Baldo came to me.

131
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,660
Only this time, I didn't run.

132
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,670
This time, I stood my ground.

133
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,500
I just looked at Mr. Baldo

134
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,920
in his stupid face, and I said,
"Go away. Go away!"

135
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,550
Just like that, he was gone.

136
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,510
Never saw him again.

137
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,470
Easy-peasy, right?

138
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,640
Easy-peasy.

139
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,940
Just like that.

140
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,150
I still don't get why
they call him zombie boy.

141
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,870
I mean, I get it. He got lost in the woods
for a week or something,

142
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,280
but why is he a zombie?
Because everyone thought he was dead?

143
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,910
Yeah. I mean, we had a funeral
for him and everything.

144
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,580
After a week?

145
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,960
Well, see,
some other kid drowned at the quarry.

146
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,710
We thought it was Will
because his body was super decomposed.

147
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,790
What?

148
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,420
Okay, that's not funny.

149
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,590
It's not a joke, all right?
It's public knowledge.

150
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,090
You can ask anybody.

151
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,880
Except Will,
because he is really sensitive about it.

152
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,970
All right?

153
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,160
Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848
who had a nightmarish accident.

158
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,870
A large iron rod was driven
completely through his head.

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Phineas miraculously survived.
He seemed fine.

160
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,380
And physically, yes, he was.

161
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,340
But his injury resulted
in a complete change to his personality.

162
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,470
So much so that friends that knew him

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,890
started referring to him
as "No longer Gage."

164
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,850
At the time, this was known
as the American Crowbar Case.

165
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,270
Although it wasn't a...

<font color="#ff00ff">[panting]</font> I am so sorry, Mr. Clarke.

167
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,650
Really, I'm so sorry.
Please continue with the class.

168
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,780
Don't mind me.

169
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,070
Really, continue, please. Thanks.

170
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,530
Although it wasn't a crowbar,
it was a rod, as I said.

only open the door

don't ever go out alone,
especially not in the daylight.

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,540
- You wanna hold him?
- No, no.

309
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,140
- He doesn't bite.
- I don't want to...

310
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,630
Oh, God, he's slimy!

311
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,630
Ugh, he's like a living booger.

312
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,470
Ugh, oh, God!

313
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,140
What is he?

314
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,970
My question exactly.

315
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,600
At first, I thought
it was some type of pollywog.

316
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,650
- Pollywog?
- It's another word for tadpole.

317
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,490
- A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad.
- I know what a tadpole is.

318
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,860
All right, then you know
that most tadpoles are aquatic, right?

319
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,910
Well, Dart, he isn't.
He doesn't need water.

320
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, but aren't there
nonaquatic pollywogs?

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,370
Terrestrial pollywogs?
Yep. Two to be exact.

322
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,910
Indirana semipalmata.

323
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,670
And the Adenomera andreae.

324
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,170
One's from India,
one's from South America.

325
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,960
So how did one end up in my trash?

326
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,510
Maybe some scientists brought it here,
and it escaped?

327
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,920
Do you guys see that?

328
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,340
Looks like something
is moving inside of it.

329
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,470
- <font color="#ff00ff">[screeches]</font>
- <font color="#ff00ff">[both gasp]</font>

330
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,680
<font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Whoa.

331
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,890
It's okay. It's okay.

332
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,150
- I got you, little guy.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[chittering]</font>

333
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,900
I know you don't like that. It's okay.

334
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,190
And there's another thing.

335
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,900
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.
Ectothermic, right?

336
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,240
They love heat, the sun.
Dart hates it. It hurts him.

337
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,030
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile...

338
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,080
Then I've discovered a new species.

339
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
<font color="#ff00ff">[bell rings]</font>

340
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,100
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.

341
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,950
- What if he steals my discovery?
- He's not gonna steal your discovery.

342
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,890
You know, I'm thinking about calling it
Dustonious pollywogus.

343
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,150
- What do you think?
- I think you're an idiot.

344
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,070
When I become
rich and famous for this one day,

345
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,470
don't come crawling back, saying,

346
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,450
"Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry
for being mean to you back in 8th grade.

347
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,490
Oh, my God."

348
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,500
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
Baloney?

350
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,790
Mmm.

351
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
- Last night was fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

352
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,340
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.

353
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,590
No! No, you didn't.

354
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,970
Okay.

355
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,890
I mean...

356
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,690
I... I like you so much.

357
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,610
Not just you,
everything that comes with you.

358
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,480
Your family, your boys.

359
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,950
And I hope it's not
wishful thinking, but...

360
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,650
I kinda feel like
I'm breaking through with them.

361
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,070
Not so much Jonathan.
He's a tough cookie to crack, but...

362
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,070
Yeah.

363
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,040
With Will, I don't know,
I feel like we're connecting.

364
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,450
He likes you, too.

365
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,790
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

366
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,170
I can tell.

367
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,250
Good.

368
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,840
Oh, there was...
something else I was gonna mention, but...

369
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,180
It's not a big deal at all, but...

370
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,550
I just noticed this morning that my JVC
was a little dinged up.

371
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,850
- Your what?
- The video camera.

372
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,930
- Oh.
- Yeah.

373
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,150
It still works fine and everything.
I just...

374
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,020
I went back and watched the tape...

375
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,030
and there were some older kids
picking on Will.

376
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,320
- What?
- They scared him.

377
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,030
Who were they?
Were they the Zimmerman brothers again?

378
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,320
Um, I don't know.

379
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,290
They were wearing masks
or sort of makeup and...

380
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,830
Maybe. They were the right age.

381
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,330
I'll kill them.

382
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,500
I swear to God, I will...
I will kill them.

383
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,080
That's what I love about you.
You punch back.

384
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,380
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font> I was never really one
to put up a fight.

385
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,590
I struggled a lot like Will
when I was a kid.

386
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,220
With bullies.

387
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,470
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> It's the ones like us,
that don't punch back,

388
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,520
that people really take
advantage of, you know?

389
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,020
They rub your nose in it,
just a little bit more.

390
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,270
I don't know why they do that.

391
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,360
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.

392
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,570
I don't know.

393
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,330
But, hey, look at me now.

394
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,330
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!

395
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,040
- <font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font>
- Are you kidding me? I get to date...

396
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,580
It all works out in the end,
doesn't it?

397
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, it does.

398
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,010
<font color="#ff00ff">[Hopper]</font> Grass, crops, trees.

399
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,470
Everything in this area
is either dead or dying,

400
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,770
and that's a radius of over three miles.

401
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,560
And it all leads back to here.

402
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,480
See, these patterns here
are really pretty. I like the design.

403
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,480
It's almost psychedelic.

404
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,240
- This is a joke to you, huh?
- No, it's not a joke. I just...

405
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,820
I don't understand what this
has to do with me, Chief Hopper.

406
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,120
Whatever is happening is spreading
from this place, from this lab.

407
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,120
That's impossible. It's...
The last burn was two days ago.

408
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,500
It's contained.

409
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,550
- What if there's a leak?
- A leak? <font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font>

410
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,340
- I don't know, man. You're the scientist.
- Exactly.

411
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,880
And I'm telling you
there's nothing to worry about.

412
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,670
- Convince me.
- Convince you?

413
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,060
Yeah. You and your egghead friends

414
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,600
go out there to every area on this map
and you run your tests,

415
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,520
or whatever the hell it is you do,
and you see if anything comes up.

416
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,730
<font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font> All right, so...

417
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,280
So you're... you're giving me orders now?

418
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,150
No.

419
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,950
- I keep things nice and quiet for you...
- Mmm-hmm.

420
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,410
...and you keep your shit out of my town.

421
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,790
That is the deal.

422
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,960
I have done my part, now you do yours.

423
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,750
Convince me.

424
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,380
So, he asked you to take me home?

425
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,090
Yeah.

426
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,050
Yeah, he was upset.

427
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,680
I mean, he was... He was really upset.

428
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,350
But he was still worried about you.

429
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Hey.

430
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,320
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay?

431
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,440
People say stupid things
when they're wasted.

432
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,780
Things they don't mean.

433
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,360
Yeah, but that's the thing.

434
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,450
What if I did mean it?

435
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,910
All this time, I've been trying
so hard to pretend like everything's fine,

436
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
but it's not.

437
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,790
I... I feel like there's this...

438
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,540
I don't know, like this...

439
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,420
Like there's this weight
you're carrying around with you.

440
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,720
All the time.

441
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,970
I feel it, too.

442
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,470
Yeah, but it's different for you.

443
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,310
Will came home.

444
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,390
Yeah.

445
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,930
Yeah, he did.

446
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,600
But he's not the same.

447
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,150
I try to be there for him,
you know, to help him, but...

448
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,940
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> I don't know.

449
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,320
I mean, maybe...

450
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,580
maybe things just can't go back
to the way they were.

451
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,160
Doesn't that make you mad?

452
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
Mad?

453
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, that those...
those people who did this,

454
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,000
who ruined so many lives,
they just get away with it.

455
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,010
The people responsible for this...

456
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,590
- they're dead.
- Do you really believe that?

457
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,560
<font color="#ff00ff">[rock song playing over headphones]</font>

458
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,480
Your mom's boyfriend.

459
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,730
- He works at RadioShack, right?
- Yeah.

460
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
Why?

461
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,280
What are you thinking?

462
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,280

I was a disappointment to her...

very long after that, you see.

468
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,860
She died of a fever
when I was just three months old.

469
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,660
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me
to remember calling her mother.

470
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,580
I think it would be so sweet
to say 'mother.'"

Do I have a mother?

472

Yeah, of course you have a mother.

473
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,750
You couldn't really be born without one.

474
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,090
Where is she?

475
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,340
She...

476
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,970
She's not around anymore.

477
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Gone?

478
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,010
Yeah.

479
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,270
I'm sorry about that, kid.

480
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,080
"And, uh, father died
four days afterwards from fever, too.

481
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,540
That left me an orphan
and folks were at their wits' end,

482
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,580
so Mrs. Thomas said to me,
what to do with me.

483
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,210

How can I help ya?

Bob, it's Joyce.

Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?

498
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,830
Hey, um... I'm trying
to watch your video thingy,

499
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,370
and the tape, it's... it's tiny.
It's like it's shrunk.

500
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,250
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font> That's 'cause it's a VHS-C,
not a VHS.

501
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,880
You gotta find the RF-P1U
with coaxial cable

502
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,000
so you can connect the video ins and outs.

503
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,840
Bob, English.

504
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,880
Right. Sorry. Um...

505
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,180
No, yeah, I did the coaxial things
in the back, so I...

506
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,720
This one just goes into the camera itself?

507
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,940
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- It's blue. I think it's working.

508
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,250
I was thinking maybe tonight...

509
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,730
- <font color="#ff00ff">[dial tone]</font>
- Joyce?

510
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,150
So you hit T to zoom in,
and W zooms back out.

Let's go show Mr. Clarke.

What?

520
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,760
What?

521
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,800
It's about d'Artagnan.

522
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,470
This is the reason I was late for class.

523
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,050
Pretty neat. These doors function?

524
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,510
Well, yeah, obviously.
But it's not about the trap.

525
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,810
It's what's inside.

526
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,940
Now, this very well may change
your perception of the world.

527
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,140
Consider my interest piqued.

528
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,320
All right, first,
let's just clarify that...

529
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,650
this is my discovery, not yours.

530
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,070
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!

531
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,750
- I'm just trying to clarify...
- Dustin!

532
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,990
- Okay, fine.

It was just a stupid prank.

535
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,510
- What are you doing?
- I told him to stop. We need to go.

536
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,370
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Mike!
- Right now. Right now!

537
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,790
So, your sister coming or what?

538
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,340
Screw it. That little shit can skate home.

539
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,930
- And don't call her that.
- What?

540
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,180
Sister. She's not my sister.

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,780

- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> No!

545
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,160
- I don't understand.
- What do you not understand?

546
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,080
Will saw something
that looked like Dart last year?

547
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,120
Kind of, but there was no tail.

548
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,290
But then he heard it yesterday.
The exact same sound.

549
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,420
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- I wasn't sure.

550
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,790
- A coincidence.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Or not.

551
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,750
What if when Will was stuck
in the Upside Down,

552
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,420
he somehow acquired True Sight?

553
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,420
True Sight?

554
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,670
It gives you the power
to see into the ethereal plane.

555
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,380
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> Elaborate.

556
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,930
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps
having aren't really flashbacks at all.

557
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,260
Maybe they're real.

558
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,680
Maybe Will can somehow see
into the Upside Down.

559
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,270
- So that would mean...
- Dart is from the Upside Down.

560
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,770
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> We have to take him to Hopper.
- I agree.

561
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,020
No way. If we take him to Hopper,
Dart's good as dead.

562
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,940
- Maybe he should be.
- How can you say that?

563
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,710
How can you not?
He's from the Upside Down.

564
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,610
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't
automatically mean that he's bad.

565
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
That's like saying just because
someone's from the Death Star

566
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,800
- doesn't make them bad.
- We have a bond.

567
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,330
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?

568
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,580
No, because he trusts me!

569
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,960
He trusts you?

570
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,710
Yes, I promised
I would take care of him.

571

- What?
- You let him escape!

<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckling]</font> And the smell...
Gee, mother of God.

616
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,720
What exactly do you think
is going on...

617
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,960
Well, I told you what I think.

618
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,710
But we'll run the tests,
and we'll see what comes up.

619
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380
In the meantime, I just need you
to keep the area clear for us.

620
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,420
I don't think it'll be
more than a day or two.

621
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,260
What do you want me to tell people?

622
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,350
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

623
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,350
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Powell on radio]</font> Hey, Chief, you copy?
- Yeah.

624
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,060
Do you remember that Russian girl
Murray was going on about the other day?

625
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,610
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking
he's not so crazy after all.

626
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,280
Stay where you are. Do not move.

627
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,450
East is clear. No sign of Dart.

628
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,540
Where'd you go, you little bastard?

629
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,150
West is clear, too. Will?

630
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,530
South is clear. Lucas?

631
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,070
Anything?

632
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,950
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!

633
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,660
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammering]</font> Sorry,
I was looking for study hall.

634
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Bye.

635
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,290
Nothing here, man.

636
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,210
<font color="#ff00ff">[objects clattering]</font>

637
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,210
<font color="#ff00ff">[yells]</font>

638
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,840
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

639
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,520
- Why are you in here?
- Looking for Dart.

640
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,990
- This is the boys' room.
- Yeah, so?

641
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,590
So you should go home.

642
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,810
- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.

643
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,910
- How can I hate you? I don't know you.
- But you don't want me in your party.

644
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
- Correct.
- Why not?

645
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,060
Because you're annoying.
Also, we don't need another party member.

646
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,110
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric,
Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,

647
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,610
and El is our mage.

648
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,860
- El? Who's El?
- Someone. No one.

649
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,120
Someone or no one?

650
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,450
She was in our party a long time ago.
She moved away, okay?

651
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,910
She was a mage?

652
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,540
Well, what could she do?
Like, magic tricks or something?

653
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,420
Well, I could be your zoomer.

654
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,840
- That's not even a real thing.
- It could be.

655
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,090
- See? Zoomer.
- Mind-blowing.

656
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,970
Come on, you know you're impressed.

657
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,610
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> I don't see any tricks.
You're just going around in a circle.

658
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,690
<font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> If it's so easy, you try it.

659
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,310
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> No.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> Why not?

660
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,440
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> I don't know how.

661
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,650
<font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> So, then you admit
it's kind of impressive.

662
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,860
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> I think if I spent, like,
all day practicing, I could do that.

663
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,570
<font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> I would give you a million bucks
if you could.

664
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,700
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Okay, you're making me dizzy.

665
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,240
- Please just stop.
- I'll stop when I join your party.

666
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,950
- Come on, just stop.
- It's a simple question. Am I in or out?

667
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,130
<font color="#ff00ff">[grunts]</font>

668
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
Jesus! Are you all right?

669
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

670
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,310
- What happened?
- I don't know.

671
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,180
It was like a magnet or something
pulling on my board.

672
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,560
I know that sounds crazy.

673
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,580
- <font color="#ff00ff">[line ringing]</font>
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> Come on, come on, come on!

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,670
<font color="#ff00ff">[phone ringing]</font>

675
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,760
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?

676
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,510
Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.

677
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,220
- Uh, Joyce Byers.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[mouthing]</font> Joyce.

678
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,930
Uh, Will has AV Club today.
Could you transfer me to Mr. Clarke?

679
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,560
- Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what?
- What?

680
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,730
I just saw him leave for the day.
Maybe AV was canceled?

681
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,650
- What?
- Would you like me to...

682

<font color="#ff00ff">[Dart chittering]</font>

683

Guys...

684
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,280
- I found him.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Where?

685
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,740
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

686
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,860
<font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Copy that.

Hey, buddy.

692
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,720
- Come here. You know I won't hurt you.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[chittering]</font>

693
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,930
It's okay. It's just me.

694
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,060
You're okay.

695
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,310
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Mike]</font> Let's go. Down here.
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Lucas]</font> We're coming!

696
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,820
Stay low. Keep quiet.

697
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,320
Where's Dart?

698
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,200
- I don't know. Not here.
- What?

699
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,700
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Max]</font> He said by Salerno's, right?
- <font color="#ff00ff">[Dustin]</font> Yeah, maybe Will has him.

700

Where is Will?

701
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,710
Only this time, I didn't run.

702
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,720
This time, I stood my ground.
