<font color="#ff00ff">[Will]</font> It's like... It's like I feel
what the shadow monster's feeling.

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,490
See what he's seeing.

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,370
Like in the Upside Down?

9
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,250
Some of him is there.

10
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,250
But some of him is here, too.

11
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,510
- Here, like, in this house?
- In this house and...

12
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,590
in me.

13
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,510
It's like... It's like he's reaching
into Hawkins more and more.

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,520
And the more he spreads,
the more connected to him I feel.

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,690
And the more you see these now-memories.

16
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,480
At first I just felt it
in the back of my head.

17
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,150
I didn't even really know it was there.

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,320
It's like when you have a dream

19
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,870
and you can't remember it
unless you think really hard.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,910
It was like that.

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,200
But know it's like...

22
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,920
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

23
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,670
Maybe...

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,630
- Maybe that's good.
- Good?

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,260
Just think about it, Will.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,340
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

27
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,850
Spying on the shadow monster.

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,850
If you know what he's seeing
and feeling...

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,480
maybe that's how we can stop him.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,310
Maybe all of this
is happening for a reason.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,990
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

32
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,080
What if he figures out
we're spying on him?

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,830
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sniffles]</font> What if he spies back?
- He won't.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,670

35
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,670
We won't let him.

Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.

307
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,220
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

308
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,430
<font color="#ff00ff">[stammers]</font> Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly?

309
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,640
What's the problem?

310
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,890
Joyce, <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> Will doesn't look well.

311
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,560
You don't look well.

312
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,560
What's going on?

313
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,360
Nothing. Nothing.

314
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Is this an episode?
Is this one of Will's episodes?

315
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,610
No. No! No. <font color="#ff00ff">[scoffs]</font>

316
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,570
<font color="#ff00ff">[stutters]</font> I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

317
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,820
see how any of this is good for Will,
or for you.

318
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,240
And even if I wanted to play along,
I mean, how could I figure anything out

319
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,160
if I don't understand
the context of the game?

320
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,500
<font color="#ff00ff">[thunder rumbling]</font>

321
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,250
- Or...
- What?

322
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,250
- What is it?
- I know that shape.

323
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,380
It's Lovers' Lake.

324
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,630
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

325
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,970
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

326
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,850
And if that's Lake Jordan,
then you can probably find...

327
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,770
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

328
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,440
And if you just follow it naturally...

329
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,360
it moves to...

330
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,690
the Eno River.

331
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,070
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it?

332
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,450
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

333
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,200
But they act like roads.

334
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,910
And they act like roads 'cause when you
follow 'em, you'll see...

335
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,750
they don't go over water.

336
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,750
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway. Ha!

337
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,270
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

338
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,090
it's a map.

339
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,010
It's a map of Hawkins.

I repeat, a code red!

I really need someone to pick up here.

Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

All right, it's Dustin again.

361
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,790
Seriously, I have a code red.

362

Could you please shut up?

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,000
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

364
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,130
- Where is he?
- Don’t know. Don't care.

365
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,300
<font color="#ff00ff">[stutters]</font> Is he with Mike?

366
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,970
Like I said,
I don't know and I don't care.

367
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,850
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code...

368
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,020
Code red?

369
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,310
- Yep, code red. Exactly.
- Mmm-hmm.

370
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,560
I got a code for you instead.

371

00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,210
- Where you've been all this time?

A policeman and a woman
came looking for you last year.

Did they find you?

379

She won't get better...

380
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,470
will she?

381
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,140
They don't think so, no.

382
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,270
<font color="#ff00ff">[sniffles]</font> But she's not in any pain.

383
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,820
She's just stuck, they think.

384
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,030
Like in a dream.

385
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,490
A long dream.

386
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,990
A good dream?

387
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,620
I hope so.

But usually those.

She always believed
that you were out there.

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,690
She always believed
that you'd come home one day.

397

Yeah, home.

and you can stay here with me

How's that sound?

404
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,340
I wanna help you, but to really do that,
I need you to talk to me, okay?

405
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,590
Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.

406
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,930
But when you're ready.

407

Okay.

00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,230
<font color="#ff00ff">[Becky]</font> Oh, yeah, that.

- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> No one's picking up there.

459
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,800
Nancy. What about Nancy?

460
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,800
Karen, where's Nancy?

461
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,760
- <font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> Ally's!
- Ally's.

462
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,310
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that?

463
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,770
- Seriously?
- Am I done here?

464
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,730
Son of a bitch. You're really no help
at all, you know that?

465
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,560
<font color="#ff00ff">[Ted]</font> Hey! Language.

467
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I've been thinking...

468
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,000
I love you. I'm sorry.

469
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

471
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,300

472
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,880
- No.
- Good.

473
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,170
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!
- Nancy isn't home.

474
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,800
- Where is she?
- Doesn't matter.

475
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,850
We have bigger problems
than your love life.

476
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,010
Do you still have that bat?

477
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,350
- Bat? What bat?
- The one with the nails?

478
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,480
- Why?
- I'll explain it on the way.

479
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,400

After that, she was just gone.

495
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,910
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.

- It's crazy.

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
I really liked it.

501
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,630
- Liked it?
- Yeah.

502
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,550
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues?

503
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,350
I felt it was a little derivative
in parts.

504

What are you talking about?

505
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,680
I just wish it had
a little more originality.

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,310
- That's all.
- You don't believe me?

507
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,560
Lucas, come on, seriously?
How gullible do you think I am?

508
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,810
Why would I make this up?

509
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,570
I don't know. To impress me or something?
Or you're just, like, insane.

And this is how you react?

- Oh, so this is funny to you?
- Yeah. I mean...

514
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,910
kind of funny.

515
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,290

I gave you what you wanted.

520
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,890
I wanted to be a part of the group,
not a part of some joke.

521
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,180
It's not a joke.

522
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,980
You did a good job, okay?

523
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,900
You can go tell the others
I believed your lies

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,860
if it gets you experience points
or whatever.

but the most important is,
"Friends don't lie."

528
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Never ever. No matter what.

529
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,370
Is that right?

530
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,790
Then how do you explain this?

531
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,710
<font color="#ff00ff">[sighs]</font> I had to do that. To protect you.

532
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,040
To protect me from who, exactly?

533
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,460
The big bad government baddies
from Hawkins Lab?

534

Lower your voice.

535
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,680
Maybe it was to protect me from
the Demogorgon from another dimension?

536
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,400
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!
- Oh, no, no!

the more people like the Hollands

That's why we made the tape.

They're not wired like me and you, okay?

597
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,810
They don't spend their lives trying to get
a look at what's behind the curtain.

598
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,100
<font color="#ff00ff">[chuckles]</font> They like the curtain.

599
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,270
It provides them stability,
comfort, definition.

600
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
This...

601
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,400
this would open the curtain,

602
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,030
and open the curtain
behind that curtain, okay?

603
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,030
So the minute someone
with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,

604
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,620
everyone will nod their heads and say,
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

That is, if you even get

- That's it. That's it!
- What's it?

612
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,360
It's just too strong. Too strong.

613
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,490
Better.

614
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,750
Perfect.

615
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,170
We water it down.

616
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,130
- Precisely.
- Wait. What?

617
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,170
Your story. We moderate it.

618

620
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:14,520
Perhaps Barbara was exposed
to some dangerous toxins.

621
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,150
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.

622
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,070
Something scary but familiar.

623
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,700
Close enough that it hits the man
right where it hurts.

624
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,490
And those assholes that killed Barb...

630
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,300
Well, we didn't find
any signs of contamination.

631
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,020
Uh, nothing hazardous
other than some pesticides.

that I love her very much?
