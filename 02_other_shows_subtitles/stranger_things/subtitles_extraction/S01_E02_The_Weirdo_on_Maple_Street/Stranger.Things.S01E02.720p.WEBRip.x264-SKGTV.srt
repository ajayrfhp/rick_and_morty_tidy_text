00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,250
[rain falling]

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,670
[thunder rumbling]

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,680
[breathing heavily]

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,826
[Mike] Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,930
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,220
[Lucas] Did you run away?

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,310
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,166
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,400
I bet she's deaf.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,570
Not deaf.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,950
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,910
[thunder rumbles]

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,410
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,410
- No, no, no!
- [boys exclaiming]

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
[Dustin] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,430
See over there?
[stammers] That's the bathroom.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,510
Privacy.
Get it?

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,910
You don't want it closed?

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
No.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,910
Oh, so you can speak.

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,200
Okay, well...

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,290
Um, how about we just keep the door...

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,130
just like this.

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,340
- Is that better?
- Yes.

25
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,100
[Dustin] This is mental.
[Mike] At least she can talk.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,060
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,850
She tried to get naked.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,620
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,150
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,690
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,400
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,170
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Seriously though, think about it.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,330
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,570
[Dustin] Why she went like...

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,420
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
- Like Michael Myers.
- [Lucas] Exactly!

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,170
We should've never brought her here.

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,646
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,420
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

41
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,276
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,260
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,930
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

44
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,350
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,270
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,600
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,270
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,570
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

49
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,780
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,820
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,950
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,870
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

53
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,226
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,436
We'll be totally in the clear.

55
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,250
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

56
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,710
And this time, we find Will.

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,720
[Dustin] You really think she's psycho?

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,390
Wouldn't want her in my house.

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,430
[sighs] Mental.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,770
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,110
[door closes]

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,490
Is that real?

64
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,580
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

65
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,210
What's it mean?
Eleven?

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,670
That's your name?

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,840
Eleven. Okay.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,260
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,560
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,020
Um, well, okay.

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,190
'Night, El.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,730
'Night, Mike.

73
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,000
[door opens and closes]

74
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,890
[thunder rumbling]

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
[theme music playing]

76
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,810
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

77
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,690
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

78
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,650
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

79
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,150
[sniffles] Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,716
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,876
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

82
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,320
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

83
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,780
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

84
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,056
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

85
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,226
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- Ten cents?

86
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,870
- [stammering] If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

87
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,210
[stutters] You can't get like this, okay?

88
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,710
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

89
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,340
[knocking on door]

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,590
[sighs] We've been waiting six hours.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

92
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,050
Six hours.

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,260
A little bit of trust here, all right?

94
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,310
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

95
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,060
- And?
- Nothing.

96
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,560
God.

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,650
Flo says you got a phone call?

98
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,900
Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,610
[Joyce sniffles]

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
[Hopper] Storm barbecued this pretty good.

101
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,330
- The storm?
- What else?

102
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,330
You're saying that that's not weird?

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,080
No, it's weird.

104
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,670
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the...

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,760
No, it doesn't work like that.

106
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,590
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

107
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,406
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,470
No. It was him.
It was Will.

109
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,520
[voice breaking] And he was scared.
And then something...

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,440
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,336
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,530
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

113
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,610
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

114
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,320
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

115
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,620
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

116
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,216
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,710
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

118
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,080
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,790
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

120
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
[Joyce sniffles]

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,850
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,376
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

123
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,070
[Joyce sighs] Oh, come on!

124
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,230
You're wasting your time.

125
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,950
Hey, Hopper.

126
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,200
Hopper. [panting]

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,530
Let me go.

128
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,950
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,910
[stammering] You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,420
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,210
He'll... He'll hide.

132
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,000
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

133
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,420
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

134
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,180
Stay here with your mom.

135
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,470
She needs you.

136
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,560
[engine starting]

137
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,480
[music playing faintly on TV]

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,820
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

139
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Do a lot of studying last night?

140
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,830
Yeah, actually, I did.

141
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,290
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

142
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,090
Hey, what's going on?

143
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,590
[both] Nothing.

144
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,800
[radio static]

145
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,640
[footsteps approaching]

146
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,390
Hey, you found my supercomm.

147
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Pretty cool, huh?

148
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,610
I talk to my friends with it.

149
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,570
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

150
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,730
Signal's pretty weak.

151
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,110
Got you breakfast.

152
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,660
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

153
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,136
but I just need you to go out there.

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,290
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

155
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,920
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,130
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

157
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,210
Understand?

158
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,720

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,200
[Donald] Joyce, I wasn't
expecting you today.

319
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,410
- I brought Jeffrey in to cover.
- [stammers] I'm not here to work.

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,910
I... [sighs]

321
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,130
The storm last night, I...

322
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,920
[sighs] I need a new phone.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,050
[cash register dings]

324
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,550
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

325
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,430
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

326
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,800
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

327
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,680
for the copies for the posters.

328
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,140
Uh, I need an advance.

329
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,560
Yes, well, of course.

330
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,230
- Of course.
- [softly] Thank you.

331
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,270
[Joyce sighs]

332
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,650
[stammers] Yeah, uh, I was thinking,
two weeks?

333
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,160
Um...

334
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,290
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering...

335
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,370
Donald.

336
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,670
I've been here ten years, right?

337
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,710
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

338
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,170
I've worked, uh,
Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.

339
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,680
[voice breaking] I don't know
where my boy is.

340
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,970
He's gone.

341
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,100
I don't know if I'm...
gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...

342
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,190
[sighs] I, uh...

343
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,440
I need this phone
and two weeks' advance.

344
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,820
And a pack of Camels.

345
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,130
- We're all clear.

[mimicking Yoda] Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

352
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,376
[in normal voice] His name's Yoda.

353
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,530
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

354
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,950
Whoosh!

355
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,410
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

356
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,386
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

357
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,540
[Rory roaring]

358
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

359
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,800
We got first every year.

360
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,590
Except for last year when we got third.

361
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,760
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

362
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,870
You know Will?

363
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,040
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

364

[vehicle approaching]

365
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,710
We gotta go.

366
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,300
[Karen] I bought pizza
and macaroni.

367
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,930
[Holly] Okay.
[Karen] Okay.

368
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,560
Ted? Is that you?

369
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,850
Just me, Mom!

370
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,600
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

371
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,940
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

372
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,740
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

373
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,780
Do you understand?

374
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,450
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

375
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,910
Promise?

376
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,000
It means something that you can't break.

377
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,000
- Ever.
- [Karen] Michael?

378
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,670
Please?

I just... I don't feel good.

398
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,650
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

399
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,970
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

400
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,466
but the last time I told you I was sick

401
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,466
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

402
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,320
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

403
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,700
- No?
- No, of course not.

[sighs]

405
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,960
All this that's been going on with Will,

406
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,170
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

407
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,960
I just...

408
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,510
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

409
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,340
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

410
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,550
I'm here for you. Okay?

[thud]

Is there someone else here?

No.

El?

[Hopper] Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

426
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,250
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

427
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,590
[Callahan] Oh, hell, I could survive that.

[Hopper laughs]

429
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,800
[Callahan] What?
George Burness made the jump.

430
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,220
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

431
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
George is a liar.

432
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,260
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

433
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,950
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

Nah.

Mmm-hmm.

[Callahan] Missing kid, suicide...

You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

447
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,990
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

[Cynthia] Yeah.

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,250
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

455
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,396
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

456
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,920
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

457
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,340
[Jonathan] Hey, Will?

458
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,800
Will!

459
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,970
Will, you here?
Will!

[grunts]

461
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,100
Get off!

462
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,850
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

463
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,060
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

465
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
My oldest.

466
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,360
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

467
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,170
[door closes]

468
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,840
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

469
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,776
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

470
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,510
What do you mean she knows about Will?

471
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,680
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

472
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,640
- [Lucas] You could tell?
- Just think about it.

473
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,996
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

474
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,640
the same place where Will disappeared?

475
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,020
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

476
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,400
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

477
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,860
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

478
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,070
Do you know where he is?

479
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,216
[loudly] Do you know where Will is?

480
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,580
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

481
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,540
If you know where he is, tell us!

482
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,420
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

483
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,920
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

484
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,420
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

485
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,010
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

486
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,720
Danger danger.

487
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,470
No, no, no!

488
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,310
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

489
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,990
No.

490
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,920
[Lonnie] Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,880
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

492
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,750
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

493
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,260
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

494
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,930
he's not here and he never has been.

495
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,010
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

496
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,600
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

497
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,220
You know, he was lost or something.

498
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,560
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

499
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,770
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

500
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,190
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

501
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,400
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

502
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,450
Come out here to the city.

503
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,160
People are more real here, you know?

504
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,950
And then I could see you more.

505
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,580
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

506
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,710
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

507
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,090
She even know you're here?

508
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,130
Oh, great.

509
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,920
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

510
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,800
Some real fine parenting right there.

511
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,640
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

512
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,020
In case you forgot what he looks like.

513
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,360
[Cynthia] He's kinda cute, hmm?

514
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,490
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

515
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,630
[Earl] Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

516
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,450
You, uh, notice anything...

517
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,870
odd about him the last few weeks?

518
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,210
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

519
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,420
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

520
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,710
He got any enemies you might know about?

521
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,880
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

522
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,970
[sighs] The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

523
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,510
nah.

524
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,350
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

525
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,690
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

526
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,850
Me and Henry and... [sighs]

527
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,690
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

528
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,820
No kid did this.

529
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,820
Kid?

530
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,700
What are you talking about?

531
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,700
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

532
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,540
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

533
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,000
Can you imagine that?

534
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
This kid...

535
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,760
what'd he look like?

536
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,220
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

537
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,736
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

538
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,220
He look like this?

539
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,940
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

540
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,060
No. This was a different kid.

541
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,610
This one had really short hair.

542
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,770
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

543
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,490
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

544
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,660
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

545
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,120
could it be Lonnie's kid?

546
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,160
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

547
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,120
About the right height, though.

548
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,870
I mean, could've been.

549
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,630
Yeah, that's...

550
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,710
Could've been.

551
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,130
[sighs]

552
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,930
Because I don't want to go by myself.

553
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,180
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

554
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,640
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

555
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,600
No, tell them we're... studying.

556
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,400
[Karen] Nancy! Dinner!

557
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,190
Coming!

558
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,940
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

559
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,290
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

560
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,210
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

561
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't know why.

562
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,960
[chuckles] Me, too.

563
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,510
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

564
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,970
So, there's this...

565
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,550
special assembly thing tonight...

566
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,930
for Will at the school field.

567
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,020
Barb's driving.

568
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,270
Why am I just hearing about this?

569
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,190
I thought you knew.

570
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,360
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

571
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,780
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

572
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,900
I mean, everyone's going.

573
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,990
[sighs]

574
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,080
Just... be back by 10:00.

575
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,716
Why don't you take the boys, too?

576
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,950
- No!
- Mmm-mmm.

577
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,710
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

578
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,670
- [gasps]
- [Holly groans]

579
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,010
Sorry. Spasm.

580
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,140
- [Holly whimpers]
- Oh...

581
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,430
It's okay, Holly.

582
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,350
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

583
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,350
- [sirens wailing]
- [people shouting] Will!

584
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,650
[volunteer] Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

585
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,870
[Callahan] Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

586
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,920
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

587
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,580
And stealing food from Benny?

588
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,340
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

589
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,050
Can't ask a corpse questions.

590
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,920
- [whistle blowing]
- [volunteer 2] Hold up!

591
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,470
You got something?

592
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,760
- Hey, what do you got?
- [Mr. Clarke] Not sure.

593
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,770
Maybe nothing.

594
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,770
I found this. In there.

595
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,650
[Powell] No way a kid
crawls through there.

596
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,400
[Hopper] I don't know...

597
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,860
a scared enough one might.

598
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,320
His brother said he was good at hiding.

599
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,430
[rhythmic beeping]

600
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,480
[radio static]

601
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
[Mike] El?

602
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,200
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

603
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,790
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

604
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,290
They promise.
Right?

605
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,920
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

606
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,300
[Dustin] Ow!

607
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,010
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

608
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,140
That's all.

609
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,140
We just wanted to find our friend.

610
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,770
"Friend"?

611
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,730
Yeah, friend.
Will?

612
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,110
What is "friend"?

613
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,610
Is she serious?

614
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,700
Um, a friend...

615
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,530
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

616
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,740
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

617
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,120
And they never break a promise.

618
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,120
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

619
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,960
A spit swear means...
[spits] you never break your word.

620
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,460
It's a bond.

621
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,210
That's super important, because friends...

622
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,550
they tell each other things.

623
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,380
Things that parents don't know.

624
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,560
[music playing on car radio]

625
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,270
[Nancy] Barbara, pull over.
[Barbara] What?

626
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,640
Pull over!

627
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,230
What are we doing here?

628
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,900
His house is three blocks away.

629
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,440
We can't park in the driveway.

630
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,570
Are you serious?

631
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,836
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

632
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,570
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

633
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,490
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

634
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,120
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

635
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,460
We're gonna have a great time.

636
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,080
He just wants to get in your pants.

637
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,790
[chuckling] No, he doesn't.

638
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,170
Nance... seriously.

639
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,340
He invited you to his house.

640
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,340
His parents aren't home.

641
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,680
Come on, you are not this stupid.

642
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

643
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,930
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

644
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,890
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

645
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,940
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

All right, well...

647
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,570
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

648
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,110
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

649
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Ugh.

650
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,740
Is that a new bra?

651
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,540
No.

It's freezing.

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,060
You ever feel cursed?

661
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,570
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

662
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,950
the summer of '23.

663
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,910
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

664
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,670
When'd the last person freeze to death?

665
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,380
Hey, come back inside.

666

Warm me up. Just...

Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

674
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,240
Do you know where he is?

675
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,840
[Mike] I don't understand.

Will is hiding?

From the bad men?

679
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,610

You are a cliché.

Okay.
