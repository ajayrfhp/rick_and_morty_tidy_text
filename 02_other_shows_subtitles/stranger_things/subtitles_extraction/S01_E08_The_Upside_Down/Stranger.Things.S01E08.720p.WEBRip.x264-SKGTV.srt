Somebody, please!

[grunts]

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,820
Let me out!

[Joyce breathing heavily]

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,630
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,930
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,060
- [stammering] You have to let me...
- When...

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,770
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,570
- What?
- Hmm?

13
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,860
Six.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,240
What?

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,860
Six.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,160
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,790
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,840
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,420
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,590
Like all animals...

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,930
it eats.

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,180
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,270
More daughters.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,940
I want to save them.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,480
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,150
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,320
Not without your help.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,610
Stop.

29
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,290
I know who you are.

30
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,830
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,130
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,960
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,050
You faked his death!

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,260
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,720
We buried him.

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,890
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,560
Go to hell.

39

- [breathing heavily]
- Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,780
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,870
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
I told you.

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,460
Everything.

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,870
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,130
What do you know?

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,710
[panting]

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,130
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,590
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,270
And I know you went
a little too far this time

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,260
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,390
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,440
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,940
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,450
See, I told you.

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,120
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,410
Nobody.

58
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,660
But I did give all this
over to my friend at the <i>Times.</i>

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,516
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,920
You're just a junkie.

63
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,720
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,060
Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,940
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,600
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,940
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,570
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,870
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,990
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,790
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,590
Yeah.

74
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,760
That's right.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,480
Nancy? Jonathan?

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,490
[door closes]

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,450
- They're gone.
- What?

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,886
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,506
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,450
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No. No way!

81
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,620
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
I don't know.

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,410
No.

84
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,790
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,090
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,220
Demogorgon.

87

You gotta give me your word.

92
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,420
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,180
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,310
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,600
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

I don't understand.

99
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,880
We came to an agreement.

100
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,550
What?

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,236
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,680
we don't talk about.

103
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,970
You want Will back?

104
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,680
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,310
That's the deal.
You got it?

106
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,240
What is this?

107
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,620
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,830
Put it on.

110
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,656
[Connie] I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

111
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,720
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

112
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,560
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,230
That's not gonna happen.

[Joyce] Yeah.

[Hopper echoing]
I need you to relax, okay?

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,790
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

121

In and out.

122
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,750
Deep breath in...

123
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,840

In and out.

- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

146
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,080
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

147
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,620
Then...

two...

You don't have to do this...

155
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,560
Jonathan, stop talking.

156
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,520
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.

158
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,900
We can't just wait around.

159
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,270
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

160
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,796
The bad men are still looking for us.

161
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,756
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

162
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
El can find them.

163
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Mike, look at her.

164
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,676
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

165
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,280
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

166
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,160
That's the most important thing, remember?

167
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,160
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

168
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,670
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

169
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,040
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

170
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,510
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

171
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,670
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

172
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,010
[Mike] Are you serious?

173
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,760
El needs to be recharged!

174
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,140

[faint creaking]

177
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,990
Did you hear that?

178
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,250
It's just the wind.

179
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,380
Don't worry.

180
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,800
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

181
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,970
Speak?

182
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,090
Blink.

183
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,260
Think of them as alarms.

184
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,810
Is that too tight?

185
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,190
[stutters] No, it's fine.

186
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,480
Thanks.

187
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,040
Nancy?

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Yeah?

[Steve] Jonathan?

191
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,880
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

192
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,470
Listen, I just want to talk!

193
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,760
[banging on door continues]

194
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,286
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

195
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,746
- You need to leave.
- I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

196
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,996
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

197
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,360
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

198
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,110
I messed... I messed up.

199
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,190
Okay?

200
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,030
Really. Please.

201
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,650
I just want to make things right.

202
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,030
Okay? Please. Please...

203
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,160
[stammers]

204
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,540
Hey, what happened to your hand?

205
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,870
Is that blood?

206
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,710
Nothing.
[stutters] It was an accident.

207
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,670
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

208
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,540
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

209
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,920
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

210
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,026
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

211
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,906
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

212
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,526
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

213
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,026
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

214
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,760
[stutters] Wait.
What? What is going on?

215
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,196
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

216
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,706
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

217
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,520
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

218
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,826
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

219
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,860
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

220
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,650
Nancy! The lights.

221
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,530
- It's here.
- [Steve] Wait, what's here?

222
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,676
- [Nancy] Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

223
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,200
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

224
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,400
I don't know.
I don't see it.

225
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,450
Where is what?

226
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,290
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going...

227
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,476

[Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

232
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,890
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

233
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,446
- What the hell was that?
- [both] Shut up!

[Nancy] What's it doing?

237
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,520
I don't know.

[electricity jolts]

239
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,580

No.

them red and she said she didn't know

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,606
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

250
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,486
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

251
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,630
I suppose I had, too,

252
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

And what does make roads red?

I don't think that's the monster.

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,220
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

313
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,640
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

314
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,180
Always lying, saying she's out.

315
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,850
Bald-faced liar.

316
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,230
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

Okay!

What's "putting"?

[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

322
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

323
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Don't worry,

324
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,636
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

325
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,290
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

326
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,540
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

327
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,130
She can make you whatever you like.

328
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,500
Eggos?

329
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,840
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,680
See, I was thinking,

332
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,010
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

333
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,600
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

334
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,390
Or you can take my room if you want,

335
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,020
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

336
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,230
My point is, they'll take care of you.

337
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,020
They'll be like your new parents,

338
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,860
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

339
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,740
Will you be like my brother?

340
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,530
What? No, no. [scoffs]

341
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,160
Why "no"?

342
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,620
Because... [sighs]

343
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,750
'cause it's different.

344
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,080
Why?

345
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,210
[sighs] I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

346
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,590
It's stupid.

347
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,880
Mike?

348
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,130
Yeah?

349
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,340
Friends don't lie.

350
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,640
[sighing] Well...

351
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,010
I was thinking...

352
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,310
I don't know...

353
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,140
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

354
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,190
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

355
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,980
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

356
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,870
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

357
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,570
- No?
- I mean...

358
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,780
you can, but it'd be really weird.

359
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,540
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

360
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,120
someone that you like.

361
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,170
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

362
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,630
[sighs] Uh... uh...

363
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,300
Uh, someone like a...

364
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,890
[car approaching]

365
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,310
Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.

366
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,730
Stay here.

367
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,780
[tires screeching]

369
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,330
[agent] Go!

370
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,830
You two, on me.

371
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,090
This will charge your battery right up,
I'm telling you.

372
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,630
- [Mike] Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

373
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,300
[panting] They found us.

374
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,010
[agent] We know they're here.

375
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,640
Be advised,
west side of the building is clear.

376
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,166
[agent] Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

377
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,360
[indistinct radio chatter]

378
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,690
[agent] Nothin'.

379
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,030
Keep it locked down.

380
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,330
[agent] All right.

381
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,450
Kitchen.

382
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,710

[panting]

384
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,790
How did they find us?

385
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,436
I don't know,
but they knew we were in the gym.

386
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,630
Lando.

387
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,230
[agent] Got 'em!
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

388
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,430
[Lucas] Come on!

389
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,670
[agents yelling indistinctly]

390
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,576
- There they are. Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back!

391
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,390
[Mike] Go, go! Go left!

392

[Eleven thuds]

395
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,340
[Mike panting] El, are you okay?

396
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,010
El!

397
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,486
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

398
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,840
No, no, no,
she won't wake up. El!

399
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,590
El!
[echoing] El!

400
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,010
[Hopper] There's more blood.

401
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,650
Oh, my God.

402
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,360
[Joyce] This way.

403
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,170
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

404
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,250
[Dr. Brenner] Leave her.

405
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,130
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No!

406
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,930
You want her,
you have to kill us first.

407
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,800
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

408
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,680
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

409
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,100
- [screaming] You idiot!
- No!

410
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,310
[Dustin] Get off me!
[Mike] Ow! Let go!

411
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,560
Eleven?
Eleven, can you hear me?

412
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,690
Eleven?

413
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,650
Papa?

414
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

415
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,176
[Mike] Get off of me. [grunts]
[Dr. Brenner] I'm here now.

416
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,240
Let her go!
Let her go, you bastard!

417
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,870
[whimpering]

418
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,080
Shh, shh, you're sick.

419
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,250
You're sick,
but I'm going to make you better.

420
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,170
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

421
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,170
Where we can make all of this better,

422
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,170
so no one else gets hurt.

423
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,680
Bad.

424
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,850
Bad.

425
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,770

What?

430
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,950

You need to help get him out!

okay? [sniffles]

He's gone.
The bad man's gone.

459
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,550
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

460
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,140
she'll get you your own bed.

461
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,720
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

And we can go to the Snow Ball.

00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,180
Goodbye, Mike.

El? El?

499
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,630
- El!
- [Lucas] Eleven!

[Dustin] Eleven!
[Mike] El!

501
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,050
El, where are you?

Eleven!

El?

[Joyce panting] Oh, God.

[sobbing] He's not breathing,
he's not breathing.

506
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,796
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

507
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,610
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

508
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,610
- ...and lift his chin.
- Okay.

509
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,200
One, two, three, four.

510
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Now when I tell you,

511
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,160
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

512
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,170
- twice.
- Okay.

513
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,290
One second...

514
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,880
then pause.

515
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,630
22, 23.

516
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,750
- Then one second.
- Okay.

517
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

518
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800

Now! Go!

[Joyce whimpers]

520
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,570
- [Joyce] Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

521
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,480
Come on, kid.

522
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

523
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,980
Will, listen to me.

524
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,310
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

525
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,520
I love you so much.

526
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,820
I love you more
than anything in the world.

[Joyce sobbing]

531
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,160
I love you so much. I love you more
than anything in the world.

532
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,000
[sobbing] Please,
please come back to me. Just...

533
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,250
- Come on, kid!

<i>Come back to me, breathe.</i>

539
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,260
I need you to wake up now.

540
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,680
I need you to breathe.

541

[Will gasps and coughs]

544
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,310
[Joyce] That's it.

545

- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
- [coughing]

546

That's it, baby. Breathe.

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Breathe. All right. Come on.

548
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,780
Come on.

00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,950
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

Good, good, good, good.

551
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,910
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
[sobbing]

552

Michael!

[EKG monitor beeping]

560
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,760
Hey.

561
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,630
- Hi, sweetheart.
- [Jonathan] Hey.

562
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,600
Where... where am I?

563
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,890
[Joyce sighs]

564
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,600
[Jonathan] You're home.
You're home now.

565
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,480
You're safe.

566
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,190
Jonathan.

567
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

568
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,780
[sighs] We missed you.

569
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,700
We really missed you.

570

Are you okay?

571
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,620
What, this?

572
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,830
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

573
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,750
You're worried about my hand.

[both chuckle softly]

[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

576
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,140
We, uh...

577
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,430
We brought you some stuff...

578
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,100
so you don't get bored in here.

579
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,930
So... [sniffles]

580
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,980
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

581
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,480
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

585
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,040
[Mike] Guys, come on.

586
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,710
- [Mike] Byers!
- [Dustin laughs]

587
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,580
[Joyce] Be careful.
Be careful with him.

588
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,250
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.

589
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,090
- [Mike laughs]
- [Jonathan] Go easy on him.

590
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,736
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

591
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,446
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.

592
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,366
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

593
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,050
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

594
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,180
- [Lucas] Yes!
- [coughing]

595
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,640
You okay?

596
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,730
It got me.

597
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,900
The Demogorgon.

598
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,440
We know.

599
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,530
It's okay.

600
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,990
It's dead.

601
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,200
We made a new friend.

602
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,240
She stopped it.
She saved us.

603
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,200
But she's gone now.

604
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,870
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

605
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,266
Well, we call her "El" for short.

606
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,370
She's basically a wizard.

607
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,686
[whispers] She has superpowers.

608
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,710
More like a Yoda.

609
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,396
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind,

610
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,646
and these agents
were trying to shoot us...

611
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,736
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

612
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,800
[Dustin] And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

613
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,276
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

614
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,776
[Lucas] Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

615
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,320
- [Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
- [continues indistinctly]

616
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,100
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.

617
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,440
Hungry for your blood.

618
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,350
It is almost here.

619
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,586
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

620
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,690
It's not the thessalhydra.

621
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,330
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

622
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,860
- [loud thud]
- The thessalhydra!

623
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,530
- Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger!

624
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,370
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

625
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,120
Fireball him!

626
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,290
Fireball the son of a bitch.

627
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,000
- Fourteen!
- [all exclaim]

628
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,920
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

629
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,010
It makes a painful...
[imitates screeching]

630
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,050
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

631
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,510
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

632
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,180
and, and, and...

633
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,680
and...

634
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,390
[all cheering]

635
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,190
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

636
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,280
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

637
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,570
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

638
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,240
and you present them to King Tristan.

639
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,756
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

640
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,740
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

641
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,120
No, there's a medal ceremony...

642
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,370
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

643
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,420
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

644
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,040
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

645
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,186
But it doesn't make any sense.

646
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,670
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

647
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,210
And the proud princess?

648
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,696
And those weird flowers in the cave?

649
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,776
- I don't know, it's...
- [door opens]

650
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,970
[footsteps approaching]

651
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,140
Jeez, what's that smell?

652
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,946
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

653
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,430
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

654
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,680
He farted.

655
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,206
- Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
- [Dustin] Okay.

656
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,496
- [Lucas] Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

657
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,616
- [Lucas blowing raspberry]
- [Dustin] Oh.

658
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,100
- Will.
- [Dustin] Shut up.

659
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,286
[Jonathan] Come on.
[Lucas] Dustin farted!

660
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,320
[Will] Bye, guys.
[Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.

661
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,940
[Mike] See you, Will.

662
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,360
- [chuckles] Stop.
- No, you stop.

663
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,700
- [Dustin] No, you stop.
- [both grunting]

664
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,660
[Dustin] Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

665
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,950
[boys laughing]

666
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,630
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

667
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,760
[Karen] Hey, boys.

668
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

669
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,930
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

670
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

671
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,260
Merry Christmas.

672
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,930
- So, uh, you win?

673
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,690
- Awesome.

674
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,900
- Uh...

675
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,650
Thanks, um...

676
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,160
I... I didn't get you anything.

677
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,160
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

678
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,160
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

679
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,370
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

680
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,050
Merry Christmas.

681
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,970
- You ready? Let's go.
- [Will] Yeah.

682
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,310
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

683
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:43,650
Can I open it?

684
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,190
Yeah, sure.

685
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,280
Whoa.

686
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Pretty cool.

687
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,580
[chuckles]

688
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,740
Yeah.

689
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,040
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

690
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,580
[snoring]

691
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,260
Did you give it to him?

692
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,390
Yeah.

693
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,400
[indistinct chatter]

694
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,960
You leaving already, Chief?

695
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,340
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

696
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,760
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

697
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,850
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

698
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,180
[Powell chuckling]

699
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,680
Merry Christmas, Hop.

700
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,310
- Mmm.

701
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,170
[dog barking]

702
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,800
- [Jonathan] What you got there?
- [Christmas music playing]

703
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,920
That one of yours?

704
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,010
- Yeah.
- [Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

705
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,680
Be careful.
You'll break it.

706
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,900
What are you...
What are you doing?

707
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,400
[Jonathan] Documenting.

708
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,860
Oh, why?

709
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,320
- Because...
- [Joyce chuckles]

710
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,570
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

711
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,200
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

712
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,620
- They're so runny.
- [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

713
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,200
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

714
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,580
The green present.
It's an Atari.

715
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,290
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

716
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,250
- Really? Well...
- [Will] Yeah.

717
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,000
We'll have to see, won't we?

718
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,630
Hey, no more snooping.

719
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,890
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

720
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,180
Okay.

721
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,310
- [softly] He's washing his hands?
- [chuckles]

722
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,400
[coughs]

723
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,030
[retches]

724
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,290
[groans]

725
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,350
- [Jonathan] Thanks.
- [both laughing]

726
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,730
Are you okay?

727
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,650
Yeah, I'm okay.

728
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,440
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

729
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,650
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

730
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,900
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

731
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,310
I threw a fireball at him and...
[imitates explosion] dead.

732
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,660
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

733
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,240
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

734
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,080
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.

735
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,580
