[loudly] Where have you been?

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,380
[softly] We agreed on 10:00.

37
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,430
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

You didn't think to call and let me know?

With everything that's been going on?

41

I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

I'm sorry, Mom.

No!

50
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,290
It was just cold,

Please...
[gasps] Did you see that?

83
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,350
It's the electricity, Mom.

84
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,746
- [stammering] It's acting up.
- No.

85
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,410
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

86

No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

- No, Mom.

92

- [stammering] Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,540
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

94
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,790
He is just lost.

95

People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

[stammering] Okay.

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,930
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

98
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,300
Okay, I'm sorry.
[sniffling] I'm sorry.

99
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,640
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,230
- [sniffling] Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

103
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,610

[radio static]

110
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,840
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

111
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,510
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

112
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,130
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

113
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,930
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

114
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,510
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,220

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,270
and the wrist rocket.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,416
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

121
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,320
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

122
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,410
It's made up.

123
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,740
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

124
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,500
- and blind it.
- [sighs] Dustin, what did you get?

125
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,580
Well, alrighty.

126
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,920
So, we've got...

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,380
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

128
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,010
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

129
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,260
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

130
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,850
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

131
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,060
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

132
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,770
- We have her.
- [Lucas] She shut one door!

133
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,020
With her mind!

134
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,770
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,730
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

136
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,900
Like...

137
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,450
I bet... that she could make this fly!

138
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,160
Hey. Hey.

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,830
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

[clatters]

141
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,210
Okay, one more time.

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,540
- Okay.

143
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,340
Use your powers, okay?

- Idiot.

146
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,180
- She's not a dog!
- [Karen] Boys!

147
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,010
Time for school!

148
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,220
Just stay down here.

149
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,560
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,100
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

151
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,060
- [Karen] Michael!
- Coming!

152
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,520
You know those power lines?

153
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,400
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

154
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,520
The ones behind my house?

155
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,820
Yes.

156
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,440
Meet us there, after school.

157
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,200
After school?

158
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,610
Yeah, 3:15.

159
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,830
Ah.

160
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,500
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

161
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,800
"Three-one-five."

162
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,840
Three-one-five.

[indistinct chatter]

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,410
Hey!

166
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,580
[laughs nervously] Hey!

167
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,160

326
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,100
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- Yeah?

327
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,600
Yeah, this is it.

328
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
Oh, yeah.

329
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,060
- Yeah, this is the monster killer!
- [Mike laughs]

330
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,190
Whoo!

331
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Hey.

332
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,130
Oh, hey.

333
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,000
[knocking on door]

334
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,220
[sighs]

335
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,260
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

336
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,350
Hi...

337
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,970
I brought you a casserole.

338
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,190
Oh! Thank you, uh...

339
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,810
Uh, you wanna... come in?

340
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
[Hopper sighs]

341
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,170
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

342
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,630
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

343
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,050
What?

344
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,130
You could have at least called, said,

345
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,680
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

346
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,260
Yep.

347
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,310
I'm sorry. Uh...

348
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,770
Maybe we could go out again next week?

349
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,400
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

350
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,910
We have the <i>New York Times,</i>
the <i>Post,</i> all the big ones.

351
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,530
Organized by year and topic.

352
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,330
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

353
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,210
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

354
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,106
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

355
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,290
Yeah. We are.

356
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,340
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the <i>Times,</i>

357
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,840
and we'll check out the <i>Post.</i>

358
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,090
[scoffs]

359
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,390
The librarian?

360
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,190
[timer ticking]

361
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,900
[Joyce chuckles] Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

362
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

363
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,950
I don't know, he...

364
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,700
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

365
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,280
[stammers] It's silly, I know.

366
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,410
No.
No, it's not silly.

367
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,500
How is Jonathan holding up?

368
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,540
[inhales deeply] You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

369
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,580
He always has been, you know?

370
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,920
I...

371
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,170
[scoffs] I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

372
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,800
Is something the matter?

373
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,220
Uh, no.

374
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,550
No, I just...

375
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,850
We're having electrical problems.

376
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,060
Joyce.

377
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,560
I want you to know something.

378
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,770
If you need anything, anything at all...

379
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,400
Ted and I are here for you.

380
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,520
[Joyce] Thank you.
Thanks.

381
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,900
Okay.

382
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,740
[Joyce] How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

383
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,610
Is he, uh, okay?

384
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,660
[Karen] Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

385
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,290
He skipped school yesterday.

386
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,330
He's never done anything like that before.

387
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,360
[gasps]

388
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,980
[low growling]

389
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,950
- [timer dings]
- Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

390
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,130
Oh, where's Holly?

391
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,760
[breathing heavily]

392
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,430
[Joyce] Hey!

393
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,180
She shouldn't be here.

394
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,770
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

395
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,110
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

396
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,860
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

397
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,820
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

398
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,780
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

399
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,120
but I need you to leave.

400
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,910
Okay?

401
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,080
[Karen sighs]

402
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,500
- [line ringing]
- Come on, come on, come on...

403
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,540
- [Ms. Holland] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

404
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,500
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

405
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,960
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

406
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,090
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

407
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,380
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

408
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,430
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

409
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,890
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

410
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

411
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,100
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

412
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,360
I meant, did she come home this morning?

413
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,610
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

414
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,900
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

415
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,910
Do... Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

416
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,620
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

417
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

418
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,080
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,340
[sighs]

420
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,800
[bell rings]

421
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,140
Hey, man.

422
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,270
What's going on?

423
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,350
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

424
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,786
[Carol] We've heard great things.
[Tommy] Yeah, sounds cool.

425
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

426
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,570
[sighs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

427
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,926
[Steve] Oh, no? Oh...
[Jonathan] Hey.

428
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,160
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

429
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,756
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

430
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,040
Here we go.

431
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,830
Ah...

432
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,910
Here we go.

433
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,710
- Oh, man.
- [Tommy] Let me see.

434
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Dude.

435
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,210
[Tommy exclaims]

436
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,606
[scoffs] Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

437
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,316
- I was looking for my brother.
- [Steve] No.

438
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,090
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,430
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

440
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,640
What?

441
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,770
This creep was spying on us last night.

442
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,100
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

443
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,650
[Steve clicks tongue] See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

444
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,780
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

445
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
It's hardwired into 'em.

446
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

447
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,750
- [Tommy laughs]
- [Steve] So...

448
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,540
we'll just have to take away his toy.

449
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,750
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

450
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

451
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,550
- [Tommy chuckles]
- It's okay.

452
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,640
Here you go, man.

453
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
[Tommy laughing]

454
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,520
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

455
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,230
Boo.

[panting] You okay?

489
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

490
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

491
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,240
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

492
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,700
- blow me."
- [Tommy laughing]

493
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,186
[Steve] Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

494
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,670
Saturday.

495
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,540
[Tommy] I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

496
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,790
[Carol] Oh, he's so a virgin!

497
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

498
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,220
[chuckling]

499
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,840
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

500
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,430
[Nancy stammering] I totally forgot.

501
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,100
I told my mom I would, um...

502
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,640
I would do something with her.

503
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,656
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

504
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,140
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,150
[sighs] What the hell's wrong with her?

506
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,190
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

507
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Oh, give me a break.

508
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,650
[Carol] What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

509
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,660
Why did they hurt you?

510
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,870
What?

511
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,460
Oh, that.

512
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
Uh...

513
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,300
I just fell at recess.

514
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,420
- Mike...
- Yeah?

515
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,970
Friends tell the truth.

516
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,100
[Mike sighs]

517
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,010
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

518
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,560
Mouth breather?

519
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,560
Yeah, you know...

520
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,770
a dumb person.

521
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,020
A knucklehead.

522
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,190
[Eleven] Knucklehead?

523
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,900
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

524
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,820
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

525
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,030
- Mike...
- Yeah?

526
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,620
I understand.

527
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,950
Oh.

528
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,790
Okay, cool.

529
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,080
Cool.

530
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,480
Barb?

531
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,980
Barb!

532
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,710
Barb?

533
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,590
[rustling]

534
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,720
Barb?

[rustling]

536
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,490
Barb?

537
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,410
[growling]

538
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,490
Oh!

539
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,000

[exclaims]

547
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,030
Okay, good, good, good, good.

548
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,990
Are you...

549
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,120
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

550
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,670
[stammers] Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

551
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,790
Can you do...

552
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,590
[exclaims] Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

553
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,800
[crying] Baby, I need to know...

554
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,430
[exhales heavily] Are you alive?

555

00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,690
[softly] Are you safe?

557

[exclaims]

558
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,120
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

559
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

560
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,080
Can you...

561
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,750
[whimpering] Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

562
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,720
[voice breaking] Please just...

563
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
[mutters]

564
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,140

[sniffling]

566
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,290
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

567
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,710
Nancy?
What's the matter?

568
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,880
[crying] It's Barb.

569
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,180
I think...

570
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,470
something happened.

571
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,470
[sniffles] Something terrible.

572
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,890
[Powell] <i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

573
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,230
What don't you know?

574
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,480
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

575
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,610
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

576
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,780
She's been discredited.

577
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,006
- [sighs]
- Claim was thrown out...

578
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,160
Okay, forget about her.

579
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,490
Take a look at this.

580
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,790
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

581
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,500
Brenner.

582
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,500
He runs Hawkins Lab.

583
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,620
Okay.

584
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,210
[scoffs] You don't find that interesting?

585
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,710
Not really.

586
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,670
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

587
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,930
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

588
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,140
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

589
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,220
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

590
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,576
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

591
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,520
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

592
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,020
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

593
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,440
[sighs] Come on, man.

594
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,820
Work with me here.

595
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,490
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

596
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm just...

597
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,280
[sighs]

598
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,950
I'm saying maybe something happened.

599
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

600
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,880
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

601
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,630
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

[Callahan] <i>Hey, Powell,</i>

[siren blaring]

605

[Eleven] Here.

606
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,810
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

607
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,430
Hiding.

608
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,150
No, no, this is where he lives.

609
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,230
He's missing from here.
Understand?

610
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,800
- [Lucas] What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

611
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,570
Um... no!

612
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,320
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

613
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,910
That's exactly what we did.

614
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,040
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

617
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,856
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

618
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,526
- We are not calling the cops!

I need you to tell me what to do.

What should I do?

- [gasps]

653
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,870
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

654
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,370
You said he was alive!

655
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,870
Why did you lie to us?

656
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,170
What's wrong with you?

657
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,000
What is wrong with you?

658
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,300
- [softly] Mike...
- What?

659
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,220
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

660
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,350
Mike...

661
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,100
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

662
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,270
[Lucas] Mike!

663
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,900
[shrieks]

664
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,280
- [Joyce gasps]
- [Jonathan] Mom?

665
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,250
- Mom, what happened?
- [Joyce whimpers]

666
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,580
[Jonathan] It's okay.

667
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,920
Hey.

668
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,510
[Karen] Michael?

669
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,470
What's wrong?

670
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,810
