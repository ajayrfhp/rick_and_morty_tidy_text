00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,924
- Mother?
- Oh!

313
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,425
- [big band music playing]
- [gasps]

314
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,094
[gulping] Ahh!

315
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,431
Sal! Oh, Sally!

316
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:48,476
- Oh! Mrs. Sugarman.
- What happened when he got shot?

317
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,353
Was it quick? Did he suffer?

318
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,980
- Hey, Eddie, come on. Eddie, let's go!
- [sobbing]

319
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:57,109
- Hey! That's not yours!
- Yeah! We stole that fair and square.

320
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,237
- Mrs. S.
- Please, please tell me.

321
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:01,989
Please.

322
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,201
Mrs. Sugarman, control yourself.

323
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,026
- [sobbing]
- [BoJack] Aaah!

324
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,211
- Hey, gimme that!
- [Honey wailing]

325
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,838
- Please!
- Mother?

326
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:20,383
Why did everybody stop, huh?
What's the gag?

327
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,344
I want to dance. I want to fly!

328
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,388
[sobbing]

329
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,516
Listen, you're sloshed
and making a scene.

330
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,435
Do the responsible thing:
have one more drink to steady your nerves

331
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,646
and then drive yourself
and your young daughter home.

332
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,023
Don't make me go back
to that quiet house, please.

333
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,693
- Mother, let's go.
- Eddie, let's go!

334
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,700
- Are you all right?
- It's okay. I'm okay.

335
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,744
My hands are doing the wiggly doozle
in three-four time, but...

336
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,830
Say, I got a swell idea.
Why don't you drive?

337
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,164
But I don't know how.

338
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,084
Why, it's only as easy
as finding a hobo in a barrel of beans.

339
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,837
It'll be grand.
Everything will be just grand.

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,047
- [BoJack laughing]
- [Eddie] Whoo!

341
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,924
- [shouting]
- Get back here!

342
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:05,970
Aaah! [gasps]

343
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,014
- Jeepers!
- [sobbing]

344
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,391
Yeah! We're hooligans!

345
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:13,060
Faster. I want to feel alive again.

346
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,396
I'd do anything to feel alive.

347
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,442
- [screaming]
- [metal crunching]

348

[Eddie laughing]

349
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,994
I gotta say, you really knew
how to handle those salad tongs

350
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:32,621
for someone who appears
to have never eaten a salad.

351
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,874
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.

352
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,376
You're like a Josh Groban
who doesn't also think he's funny.

353
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,586
[grunts]

354
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:44,467
Okay, now, the house
is absolutely, totally finished.

355
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:46,969
Wow.

356
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:50,473
I wish I could somehow
pay you back for all your help.

357
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,183
Don't sweat it.

358
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,895
Hey, Eddie.

359
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,521
- Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!
- [crashing]

360
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,440
- Ow! [groans]
- What are you doing?

361
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,816
What the hell'd you do that for?

362
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,110
I don't know, I thought
you would fly to save me

363
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:06,697
and by making you fly I would,
in a sense, be saving you!

364
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:10,826
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't fly!

365
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,661
You're flying right now, asshole!

366
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,080
[gasps, groans]

367
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,375
- Why'd you make me do that?
- [groans] You're welcome.

368
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,503
I haven't flown since Lorraine died,

369
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,379
and now you ruined it.

370
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,925
Okay. Obviously, this was not
the preferred outcome for either of us.

371
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,594
You want to fly?
All right, let's fly. [grunts]

372
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:31,180
- Oh, shit. No, I'm fine, actually.
- You want to go higher?

373
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,723
You want to see how high we can go?

374
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,352
Clearly, this is a sore subject. I was
wrong to bring it up. Let's go back down.

375
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,355
The night Lorraine died
she wanted to go back,

376
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,441
but I wanted to see
how high we could go.

377
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:43,609
Whoa! Plane! Look out!

378
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:46,946
You want to know how Lorraine felt
when she got sucked into that engine?

379
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,490
- We're all just tiny bugs, right?
- [groaning]

380
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:53,452
Aaaah!

381
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,968
[panting]

382
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,096
Oh, God. No, no, come on.

383
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,973
- Come on.
- [coughing]

384
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,933
Are you insane?!

385
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,560
I don't want to live!

386
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,147
Why did you save me?
[sobbing]

387
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,650
I don't want to live!

388
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,570
[crying]

389
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,950
What were you thinking,
hoofing around the dance floor

390
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,451
like a motorized freckle?

391
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,454
- Did you snap your cap?
- You mustn't despise me, darling.

392
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:40,416
- Please.
- That's before mentioning poor Beatrice.

393
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,752
You aiming to get her killed as well?
She's all we got.

394
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,504
Oh, don't be cross with Mother!

395
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:46,964
I don't know what's wrong with me.

396
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:51,594
How am I supposed to sell sugar and
keep my secretary's self-esteem afloat

397
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,388
when you're having
honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria?

398
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,807
- Don't yell, Father.
- I just can't anymore.

399
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,767
I can't stop thinking about him.

400
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,812
I can't be with people
and I can't be alone.

401
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,814
I don't know how to be better, Joseph.

402
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:06,150
- Please fix me. I want to be better.
- [door opens]

403
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,695
[panting]

404
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,322
- [phone beeps]
- [line ringing]

405
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,657
[muffled gasp]

406
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,951
BoJack? Where are you?
Are you okay?

407
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,370
[panting] I don't know. I'm so sorry.

408
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:20,748
It's okay. Talk to me.
What's going on?

409
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,167
[BoJack] It's Michigan,
and it's beautiful here,

410
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,294
- and everything sucks.
- Michigan?

411
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,588
- BoJack, come home.
- I can't.

412
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,757
I don't belong there,
I don't belong anywhere.

413
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,010
But that's the thing,
everybody belongs in Los Angeles.

414
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:36,847
- There's, like, no barrier for entry.
- Oh, God, that's true. [sighs]

415
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:38,599
They do let in just anybody.

416
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:41,810
I was at a coffee shop yesterday,
I heard a guy trying to impress someone

417
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,271
by soft-pitching a web series
he crowdfunded.

418
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:48,233
Let me guess: the web series is about
how funny he and his friends are,

419
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:51,487
- just, like, hanging out.
- He described it as HBO's Girls

420
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,906
- but, like, from a guy's perspective.
- What?!

421
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,492
And he's just giving this away for free
in a coffee shop?

422
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,952
Somebody get this guy an overall!

423
00:22:58,035 --> 00:22:59,954
Well, the important thing
is that barista's

424
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:02,247
definitely going to have sex
with him later.

425
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:03,624
[chuckling]

426
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,168
I've missed you, Diane.

427
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,920
I've missed you, too.

428
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:12,466
Mmm. [slurping]

429
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,470
- Is Mother okay?
- She is now.

430
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:19,848
She just let her womanly emotions
get the better of her, that's all.

431
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,351
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.

432
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,560
Operation?

433
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:26,146
What's broken in the heart
can never be repaired,

434
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,942
but the brain, well, we have
all sorts of science for the brain.

435
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:34,863
She's a brand new woman now,
and she'd like to meet you very much.

436
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,282
[note plays]

437
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:42,705
- Mother?
- Oh, hello.

438
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,206
It's Beatrice.

439
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,292
Yes, that's right.
What a pretty girl.

440
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:50,421
- What did they do to you? [sobs]
- Oh, hush.

441
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:53,257
It's okay. I'm better now.

442
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,925
I don't understand.

443
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,679
Love does things to a person,
terrible things.

444
00:23:58,762 --> 00:23:59,930
[sniffles, sighs]

445
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,017
Beatrice, promise me
you'll never love anyone

446
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,104
- as much as I loved Crackerjack.
- I promise. I won't.

447
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,106
Why, I have half a mind...

448
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,734
[truck advancing, beeping]

449
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:19,283
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.

450
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,993
Hey, what's going on out here?

451
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:22,356
Probably should have warned you,

452
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,872
when these guys tear the house down
it might make some noise.

453
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,040
Tear the house down?!

454
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:29,501
Uh, yeah. You think I just want
to mope around in a shrine to the past,

455
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:32,588
getting off on my own guilt
while the rest of my life passes me by?

456
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,630
Pathetic, much?

457
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:36,508
But we spent the last eight months
restoring this place.

458
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:38,177
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,179
That's usually a series wrap
on a friendship.

460
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,681
- What is a series wrap?
- Are you serious?

461
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,392

in this backwash of a town?

00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,102

463
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,271
- So what was all this for?
- I don't know.

465
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:53,984
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?

466
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:55,194
I don't believe this.

467
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,740
Well, as a great woman once said,
suck a dick, dumbshit. [grunts]

00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,618

- Home.
