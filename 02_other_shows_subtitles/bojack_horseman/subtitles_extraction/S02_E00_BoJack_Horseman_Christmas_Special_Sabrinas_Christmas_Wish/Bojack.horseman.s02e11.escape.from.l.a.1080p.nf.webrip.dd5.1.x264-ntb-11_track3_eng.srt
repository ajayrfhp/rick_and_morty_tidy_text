1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,860
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,450
You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,550
-Wanna get a drink?
-It's eight in the morning.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,160
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,460
-That's not true.
-I don't know what time it is.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,330
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,920
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,510
-Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
-What about the store?

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,090
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,470
turquoise shit?

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,690
It's New Mexico.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,730
They'll find it.

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,530
-It's really good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,230
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,360
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,730

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,690

29
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,680
So, who are you again?

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,020
You were friends with Mom
when she lived in L.A.?

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,660
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the BoJack Horseman?

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,020
Star of screen and... book?

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,780
-Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?
-Never came up?

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,900
-All these years?
-It was a long time ago.

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,530
Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,450
-Trip.
-Trip, let's dial back the boners.

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,130
-Gross.
-What? I can't help it.

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,920
-Trip, ew.
-You are at the breakfast table

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,670
with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,130
-What could possibly be arousing you?
-Am I the old man?

41
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,710
I don't understand how it works.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,220
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,180
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,090
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,810
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

46
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,430
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,890
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

48
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,940
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,520
-I should call her.
-But what are you doing in New Mexico?

50
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,650
-Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico?
-I, uh...

51
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,000
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,610
No, of course not.

53
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,570
That would be crazy,

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,780
to come all this way just to see a woman

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,580
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

56
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,760
-I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
-Uh...

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,850
-Because she has a family, which is great.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,050
-You guys are great.
-Yeah.

59
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,340
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

60
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,850
-Mm.
-On my way to see...

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,350
-On your way to sea?
-Yes.

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,600
To the sea. To the shining sea.

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,640
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

64
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,490
-At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
-I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

65
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,870
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,980
-Invitation-only.
-Huh.

67
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,740
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.

68
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,750
-Wow.
-Hold up.

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,420
If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

70
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,780
why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,370
-in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?
-Jeez, so many questions.

72
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,500
What is this,
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities,

73
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,970
What Do They Know,
Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out?

74
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,000

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,880
Oh, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.

76
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,560
-Hello?
-Okay, so I got Turtel--

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,270
Hey, Knute.

78
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,110
-You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
-What?

79
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,300
Sounds perfect, Knute.

80
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,890
-Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
-Huh?

81
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,650
-Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
-BoJack--

82
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,150
In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

83
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,280
-Where the hell are you?
-Tesuque.

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,900
-Te-who-ka?
-Tesuque, New Mexico.

85
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,120
-Outside Santa Fe.
-Are you te-stupid?

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,740
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

87
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,920
-Just get me a couple of days.
-For what? What are you doing there?

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,380
I don't know, I just...

89
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,710
This isn't what I expected.

90
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,920
Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,630
-Can you get pinkeye?
-I have to go.

92
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,000
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

93
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,960
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

94
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,760
-to be fully starboard.
-What?

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
-And the port to be... also starboard.
-Huh?

96
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,550
-Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
-Wait, BoJack--

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,470
-Hey.
-I'm really glad you're here.

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

99
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,390
I hope this isn't weird for you.

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,600
You know, me having a family and--

101
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,020
Why would it be weird?

102
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,860
At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.

103
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,330
-I mean...
-Well, not for you.

104
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,750
-No.
-'Cause you've been busy.

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,990
-Right.
-With your career.

106
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,490
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.

107
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,290
Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

108
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,290
but seriously... make yourself at home.

109
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,870
I really don't want to impose.

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,290
If there's anything I can do
to help around here--

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,880
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

112
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,930
but now he's gotta take Trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

113
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,050
-It's the quarter-finals.
-You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

114
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,560
Now I will get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

115
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,850
-I'll take you driving this weekend.
-I need to practice every day.

116
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,730
It's embarrassing.

118
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,620
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

119
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,610
so unless you know any other adults...

120
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,660
Can BoJack take me?

121
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,570
-Huh?
-What?

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,330
-I mean, he is an adult.
-Uh...

123
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,250
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

124
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,000
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,250
Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,470
Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.

127
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,550
-Okay.
-And don't text and drive,

128
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,800
unless it's an emergency,

129
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,180
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

130
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,390
-Got it.
-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

131
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,310
Do your parents really love each other,

132
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,640
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

133
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,480
What? Why would you ask me that?

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
I don't know. Just making conversation.

135
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,450
-Why do we keep passing the same house?
-No, I don't. Shut up.

136
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,580
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

137
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,330
College kid that gives you Adderall?

138
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,830
Okay, fine.

139
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,910
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

140
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,700
He's just this stupid guy.

141
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,550
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

142
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,080
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."

143
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,550
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.

144
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,960
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

145
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,800
-Cool thing.
-So, anyway...

146
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,090
My best friend, Alison F.
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.

147
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,970
Do I really need
to know these names?

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,900
Rachel heard from Ray-Ray
and the Bean

149
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,850
that Diego said
if prom happened right now

150
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,240
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,
and I'm like,

151
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,810
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

152
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,320
You know I don't know
any of these people, right?

153
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,070
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

154
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,190
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,530
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill.

156
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,580
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

157
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,620
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

158
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,340
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"That's so funny.

159
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,790
I was just going for a drive."

160
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,550
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."

161
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,960
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
-That's the whole plan?

162
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,550
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.

163
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,050
Dude, what are you really doing here?

164
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,930

165
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,610
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

166
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,150
And I didn't know where else to go.

167
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,610
-Please do not tell your parents.
-Well, I won't,

168
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,160
but I think people are gonna notice

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,450
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

170
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,110

171
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,780
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

172
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,370
-Oh, my God. Oh!
-What are you doing?

173
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,500
-What happened to your plan?
-Oh! I panicked.

174
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,870
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top.

175
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,390
-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
-Yeah, deal.

176
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,690
-They didn't even put me in.
-I'm sorry, sweetheart.

177
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,510
You did some great cheering
from the bench,

178
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,890
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

179
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,490
-Maybe they'll put me in next game.
-Sure, they will.

180
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,350
No way they'll do that.

181
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,270

182
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,570
-What the...?
-Huh?

183
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,190
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

184
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,540
What a boat.

185
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,820
-Can I go on your boat?
-I don't see what's stopping you.

186
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,080
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

187
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Where's your car?

188
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,530
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

189
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,410
-Uh... well--
-Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

190
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,790
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,510
Please stay out of the bedroom.

192
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,970
-Does she have a name?
-Who?

193
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,640
-The boat? It does not.
-Come on. You gotta give her a name.

194
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,850
You should call her the Escape From L.A.

195
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,770
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

196
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,560
Oh, she's a good girl.

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,720
I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?

198
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,850
-Or are you a bad girl?
-Are you flirting with my boat right now?

199
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,900
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

200
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,400
-Mind if I get on top of her?
-Knock yourself out.

201
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,990
Dad, don't be gross.

202
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,570
-Wow, you really got a boat.
-Yeah, sure did.

203
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,540
So, does that mean you're leaving?

204
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh, I, uh...

205
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,450
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.

206
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,330
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

207
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,080
-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
-Oh, it's no bother.

208
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,260
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

209
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,760
Uh, everyone?

210
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,300
Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

211
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,800
-Too late.
-Seriously, stay as long as you want.

212
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,970

213
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,350
-What?
-BoJack, great news.

214
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,030
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill--

215
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,740
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

216
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,700
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral

217
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,030
-and you told me--?
-Whatever it is, I don't care.

218
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,280
Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

219
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

220
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,910

221
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,120
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

222
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,500
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

223
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

224
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,430
-What?
-I think I might be here a while.

225
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,040
Listen, I--

226
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,510

227
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,590

228
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,770
Well, who's getting seasick?

229
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,020

230
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,020
Just kidding.

231
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,150
It's such an eyesore.

232
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,780
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

233
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,950

234
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,110
BoJack?

235
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,330
-Yeah?
-Supper's ready.

236
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,700
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

237
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,630
They're gonna offer me a position.

238
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,540
-What? That's amazing.
-Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

239
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,540
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

240
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,510
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

241
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,340
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

242
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,480
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

243
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,970

244
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,150
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

245
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220

246
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,680
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

247
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,650
A bit is what they call a joke
in show business.

248
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,190
-Right, BoJack?
-That's right.

249
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,900
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

250
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,290
You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

251
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

252
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,990
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

253
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,790
Whatever. Get bent.

254
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,990
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

255
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,910

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,450
I'll talk to her.

257
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,750
Everyone said for months

258
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,830
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
-Yeah?

259
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,840
-But he keeps not doing it.
-That is so typical Diego.

260
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,920
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

261
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,590
-Way to take initiative.
-Oh. Rookie mistake.

262
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,350
So, I asked him and he said no.

263
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,100
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

264
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,850
And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.

265
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,110
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

266
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,280
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,070
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

268
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,780
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

269
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,370
-because you can actually--
-Mom.

270
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,200
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

271
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,800
-and you'd go to your sock hops.
-Do you think

272
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,830
-I went to high school in the '50s?
-Penny, hey, I got an idea.

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,370
-You should take me to the prom.
-Huh?

274
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,250
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

275
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,430
What? Why?

276
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,140
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

277
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,930
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

278
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,890
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

279
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,140
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

280
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,900
and that'll make him super jealous.

281
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,400
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "Hey."

282
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,150
And then you say, "Hey."

283
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,150
-Oh, that's so cold.
-Right?

284
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,400
-Wait--
-Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

285
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,780
-How is that cold?
-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

286
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,320
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

287
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,290
And then... never dance with him.

288
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,580
-That'll show him.
-Wait-- I'm sorry.

289
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,330
-Don't you want to dance with Diego?
-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

290
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,830
-This is a great plan.
-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

291
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,050
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

292
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,850
Oh, yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

293
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,090
Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

294
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,440
-Cheese.
-I think we have enough pictures.

295
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,930
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

296
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,610
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

297
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,850
And who are you again?

298
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,360
-I'm Maddy.
-Maddy's my best friend.

299
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,820
-I thought Alison F. was your best friend.
-That was like three best friends ago.

300
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,400
You were best friends
with Alison F.?

301
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,400
-No.
-Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

302
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,450
But they call me Pete Repeat
because I always say everything twice.

303
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,460
-Everything?
-Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

304
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,870
-Okay.
-Ah, damn.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,460
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.

306
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,420
Cool.

307
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,600

308
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,930
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean
are already posting pics on Instagram.

309
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,760
-What?
-Hashtag much?

310
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,770
Let me see.

311
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,730
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

312
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,560
-What are you drinking?
-Nothing.

313
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,600
-Hand it over.
-Fine.

314
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,990
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

315
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,950
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.

316
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,280
-Where are we going?
-I'll get you some bourbon.

317
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,370
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.

318
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,400
Wait, really?

319
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,160
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,160
Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?

321
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,550
Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.

322
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

323
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040

324
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,000

325
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,130
-Ugh. It burns.
-Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

326
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,340
You want some?

327
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,680
-No, thanks.
-Pussy.

328
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm driving.

329
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,760
Well, more for me.

330
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,100
This prom is really bourgeois.

331
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,610
-Lyla K. is so pretty.
-Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

332
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,400
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

333
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,400

334
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,610
Beat it, Poindexter.

335
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,650
-Poindexter?
-It's a nerd reference...

336
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,820
-Just beat it.
-Ah!

337
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,870
--Huh?

338
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,990
-Hey!
-What's the big idea?

339
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,630
Why is there an adult
at our high school prom?

340
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,870
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

341
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,590
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

342
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,260
-All right. -I'm listening.

343
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,970
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

344
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,180
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.

345
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,760
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the BoJack,

346
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,150
-take your hands and put them on your--
-Boo!

347
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,180
-This sucks.
-This guy's bad.

348
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,680
God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

349
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,270

350
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,730

351
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,730
This prom sucks.

352
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,910
You can say that again.

353
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,110
-I know.
-My flask got empty.

354
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,570
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

355
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,750
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

356
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,370
-You can't just leave the prom.
-Of course you can. You're young.

357
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,990
You can do whatever you want.

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,370
That's what they never tell you

359
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,010
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

360
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,750
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

361
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,760
-Society.
-Well, what else are we gonna do?

362
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,260
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

363
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,970
Is that a lyric
from that "Do the BoJack" song?

364
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,010
Just get in the car.

365
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,850

366
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,480
Okay, one... two... three.

367
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,530
Wow. That is so beautiful.

368
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,710

369
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,990
Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

370
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,500
We could see the whole city.

371
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, I wanna go.

372
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,340
--Oh.

373
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,800
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

374
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,590
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

375
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,640
This is nice.

376
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,340

377
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,960
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

378
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,340
I don't know. It just came to me.

379
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,730
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

380
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,610
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.

381
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Well, you wanna dance?

382
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,520
Yes, hold on.

383
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,980
Got it, okay.

384
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,360

385
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,270
It's buffering.

386
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,570
Buffering still, buffering.

387
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,700
This night has been... so perfect.

388
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,870
You know, you look just like your mother.

389
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,620
Guys?

390
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,130
I think you should come down here.

391
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,000
She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.

392
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,850
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.

393
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,960
-She can spend the night.
-Maddy, come on.

394
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,840
No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,

395
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,770
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

396
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,940
I really think we should get Maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.

397
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,150
Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

398
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,560
BoJack, what do we do?

399
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,450

400
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
-Society.
-Careful.

401
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,750
-I'm being careful.
-Okay.

402
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,490
-Lock the wheels.
-Watch her head.

403
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,240
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.

404
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,420
Pete, you're in charge.

405
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,410
-Penny and I are gonna take off.
-What?

406
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,840
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.

407
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,180
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,

408
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,580
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.

409
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,500
Why?

410
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,260
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

411
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,340
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,

412
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,510
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.

413
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,190
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

414
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,020
-I don't know, BoJack.
-Pete.

415
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,430
I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.

416
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,440
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

417
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Are we clear on this?

418
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,620
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

419
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,730
Uh...

420
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,870
Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.

421
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,160
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

422
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,150

423
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I... I don't know.

424
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,290
And what happened to your friends
BoJack and Penny?

425
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,370
They left early.

426
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,210
See, that's not so hard.

427
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,830
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.

428
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,130

429
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,670
-Okay.
-Is it okay?

430
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,600
Or "okay" okay?

431
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,720
-Uh... "okay" okay.
-All right, that's what I thought.

432
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,510
You're the future of America!
Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

433
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600

434
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,140
-She's gonna be okay, right?
-She'll be fine.

435
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,480
It's a part of growing up.

436
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,020
And we did the right thing back there,
you think?

437
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,980
I... Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

438
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,190
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

439
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,490
Well...

440
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,530
I had a really good time tonight.

441
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,500
Even with all the craziness.

442
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,460
This was really special.

443
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,630
I'm glad.

444
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,750
You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.

445
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,500
You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...

446
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,350
you know, a person.

447
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,380
So, thanks. Mwah.

448
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,140
-Well, you're welcome, Penny.
-Mm--

449
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,800
-Whoa, Penny, come on.
-If you want to do it, I'm ready.

450
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,560
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

451
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,270
-With your mouth?
-I put one on a banana in health class.

452
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,770
With your mouth?
What kind of health class--?

453
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,400
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

454
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,860
Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.

455
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,190
Okay, that's not--

456
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,950
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

457
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,860
-Penny, no.
-It's okay. I want this.

458
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,910
No, you think you do, but...

459
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,130
You don't know what you want.

460
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, God.

461
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,460
This is so dumb.

462
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,290
-No, Penny, don't--
-I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,930

464
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,510
Hey.

465
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,100
-What'd you do with my daughter?
-She had a big night.

466
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,140
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

467
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,570
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

468
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,950
-You know you can get your own, right?
-Hey, do you remember that time

469
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,610
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?

470
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,990
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

471
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,360
-Yeah.
-Ooh. That was really bad

472
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,320
for the environment.

473
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,200
-True, but--
-A seagull could've choked

474
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
-on one of those balloons.
-But it's a nice memory, right?

475
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,800
It was a fun night.

476
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,910
We had a lot of fun nights.

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,330
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

478
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,750
-Do you remember?
-Oh, God.

479
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,970
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

480
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,970
-Well, do you still think it's true?
-Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

481
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,340
No.

482
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,350
No, I think you're the tar pit.

483
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,930
-Me?
-No, not "you" you.

484
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,650
I'm just saying, like...

485
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,640
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

486
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,440
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

487
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,660
or Maine or New Mexico.

488
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,030
You know, you can't escape... you.

489
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,990
-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
-No, what? No, I don't.

490
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,790

491
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
-I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
-About what?

492
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,790
I keep... making these bad decisions.

493
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,050
-And hurting people.
-Well...

494
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,130
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Is it a long joke with no punch line?

495
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,640
-No.
-Then go ahead.

496
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,930
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

497
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,390
You know what the doctor says?

498
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,940
-"Don't do that."
-Yeah.

499
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,140
-That's actually... good advice.
-And you know what else?

500
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,980
The doctor in that story was a woman.

501
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,280
What?!

502
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,530

503
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,750

504
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,170

505
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,280
Oh. BoJack, um...

506
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,120
-I think you got the wrong idea.
-Let's go.

507
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,300
-Let's get out of here right now.
-No, BoJack.

508
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,720
You and me, this is real.

509
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,350
-You know this is real.
-My husband is right upstairs.

510
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

511
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,800
-Don't do this, BoJack.
-I know you feel it, too.

512
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,220
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

513
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,590
but this is the right thing,

514
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,800
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

515
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,140
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

516
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,360
and imagining what could have been.

517
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,770
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

518
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,070

519
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,530
-I think you should go.
-Okay.

520
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,440
-Tomorrow.
-Charlotte--

521
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,150
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

522
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,360
I am happy here.

523
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,030
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

524
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,580
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

525
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,960
-I don't know you.
-You do.

526
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,250
I don't. And you don't know me.

527
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,050
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

528
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,170
-I love you, your family and this town.
-Stop.

529
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,930
-I never wanted to hurt--
-BoJack--

530
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,430
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

531
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,430
-Everything can go back to normal, but--
-No, no, stop. No.

532
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,970
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

533
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,480
I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.

534
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,230
You make me too sad.

535
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,810
Okay.

536
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,900
What are you doing here?

537
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,820
I know what I want, BoJack.

538
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,120
Go to bed, Penny.

539
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,230

540
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,930
Wait, what?

541
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,850

542
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,350
Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

543
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,110

544
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,110
-No.
-Mom.

545
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,910
-Charlotte.
-Penny, go to your room.

546
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,290
-We didn't even do anything.
-Now, Penny.

547
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,160

548
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,750
-Charlotte, I am so sorry--
-Don't. Don't you dare.

549
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,180
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

550
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,340
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

551
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,760
I will fucking kill you.

552
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,810

553
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,780

554
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,240

555
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,530
Hey.

556
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,120
Hey.

557
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,780
You're still here?

558
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,660
Yep, still here.
