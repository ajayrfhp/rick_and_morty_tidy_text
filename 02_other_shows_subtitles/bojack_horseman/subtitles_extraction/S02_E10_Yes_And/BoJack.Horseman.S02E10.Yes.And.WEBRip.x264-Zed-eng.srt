[snoring]

2
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,435
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,229
Think she's dreaming that
she's not overstaying her welcome?

4
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,481
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

5
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,443
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,195
-but then she just drank the wine.
-Five days ago.

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,906
-Morning, everybody.
-Aah! Kinko!

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,158
Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,829
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

10
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:38,998
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,709
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

12
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,586
No. Kites are sky trash.

13
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:48,340
[groans]
Why is it so daytime right now?

14
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,341
Wanda?

15
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,593
[groaning]

16
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,805
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

17
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,848
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

18
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,058
Not all of us. Just some of us.

19
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,227
Oh, yeah, my job.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,397
-Morning.
-[J.D.] What?

21
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:07,067
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

22
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,820
What sabbatical? I fired you.

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,238
Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"

24
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,074
that was just you
"giving me the business."

25
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,494
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,078
Oh.

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,999
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,292
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,587
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."

30
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,466
I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.

31
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,176
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

32
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,845
Then we record the show.

33
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,138
And then I gotta take my suit off.

34
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,224
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

35
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,019
[groans]

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:42,979
[groans]

37
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:44,814
Ah.

38
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,106
"Looking for a friend?"

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,399
Yes.

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,818
"Need direction?"

41
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm listening.

42
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,613
"Try Scientology"?

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,699
-Huh.
-Excuse me? Sir?

44
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,034
-Huh?
-Have you ever thought

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,452
about trying improv comedy?

46
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,206
Improv comedy? I don't know...

47
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,709
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

48
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,210
Here on Mars.

49
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,628
We're on Mars?

50
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:12,424
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

51
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,509
Whoa!

52
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,136
The only limit is my imagination.

53
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,015
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

54
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,102
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

55
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,854
Ha, good one.

56
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,189
-But no.
-Oh.

57
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,902
[♪♪]

"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.

59
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:31,129
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."

60
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,379
[Abe] Cut!

61
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,547
We got it!

62
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,215
That's the day, everybody.

63
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,216
[slurping]

64
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,220
-You sure we got it, Abe?
-Of course. You were phenomenal.

65
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,307
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

66
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,102
-We can fix that in post.
-Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

67
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,937
the boom mike fell into the last shot.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,731
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

69
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,692
What am I, Kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,736
It's an easy scene.

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,074
Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

72
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,575
Boom. Bam! Done!

73
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,787
But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.

74
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:08,749
I don't know what Secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

75
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,710
-Yeah, but--
-Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

76
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,129
we'll give them gangbangers.

77
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,506
-We get paid either way, right?
-I guess.

78
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,759
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

79
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,052
You like coq au vin?

80
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,181
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in--

81
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,723
Come over for dinner, okay?

82
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,100
-You'll love it.
-Okay.

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,603
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.

84
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,522
[slurping]

85
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,818
-BoJack. Shut up.
-Aah! What are you--?

86
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,319
No one can know I'm here.

87
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,363
-What?
-Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

88
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,449
As you know, you're my favorite client.

89
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,244
If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

90
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,206
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

91
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,834
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,127
Good guy, total hack.

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,629
Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

94
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,632
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

95
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,467
Theater? That's what real actors do.

96
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,095
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

97
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,681
-She?
-Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

98
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,558
-She came out of nowhere.
-Jill Pill?

99
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,061
New York Magazine called her
the enfant terrible

100
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,562
of the immersive theater world,

101
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,981
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

102
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,650
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

103
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:20,029
-Something artistic and bold.
-Rehearsals start in two weeks.

104
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,281
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

105
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,034
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

106
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,537
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

107
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,792
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

108
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,794
[all] Apple sauce!

109
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,921
Oh-ho!

110
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,256
That was so funny.

111
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,758
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

112
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,263
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

113
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,473
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
-Uh... I don't know.

114
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,683
Suggestions?

115
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,684
[all laughing]

116
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,811
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

117
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,564
-Way to break the fourth wall.
-That wasn't that funny.

118
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,609
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

119
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,402
-Oh, Bryan.
-Todd, in improv,

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,697
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

121
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,326
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

122
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,413
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

123
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,415
We call that "yes, and..."

124
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,920
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

125
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,463
Is it really that simple?

126
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,134
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

127
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,135
Oh, Bryan.

128
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,137
[all laughing]

129
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,266
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

130
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,350
It's about community.

131
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,894
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

132
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,396
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

133
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,357
I thought you said it was free.

134
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,068
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

135
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,365
I am so proud of you.

136
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,868
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

137
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,038
-Yeah, I don't know--
-And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."

138
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,958
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

139
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,835
-Well--
-You know, the sound guy's wife

140
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,295
works with at-risk teens.

141
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,299
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

142
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,050
-your wife is bullshit!"
-Oh.

143
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,551
And he had to agree with me.

144
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,470
-Um--
-Because I am his boss.

145
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,931
-Listen--
-Let me talk to one of the locals.

146
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,726
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

147
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,603
-Oh, uh...
-Ah, now come on.

148
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,815
-Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
-Find one with a tongue.

149
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,441
-I don't think--
-Indulge me.

150
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,442
Okay.

151
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,904
[in softer voice]
Hello. I am refugee from village.

152
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,033
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,119
Uh, my name is...

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,166
Coffee Maker.
[groans]

155
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,003
Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

156
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,592
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

157
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,846
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

158
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:51,847
Eh...

159
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,849
-Oh, Bryan.
-Guys, look.

160
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,184
It's Copernicus.

161
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,268
[all gasp]

162
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,103
-Who's that?
-What are you, new?

163
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,604
Yes, I am new.

164
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,107
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

165
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,568
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner
of modern improv.

166
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,654
-Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
-The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

167
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,822
Oh.

168
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,949
-Let's go talk to him.
-Are you kidding?

169
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,118
You can't just go up and talk
to Copernicus.

170
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,121
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

171
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,248
No, I'm not.

172
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,334
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

173
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:21,710
Freestyle.

174
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,879
No audience, no net.

175
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,548
-I don't know...
-Hey, if you're down with the prov,

176
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,841
you gotta prove that prov.

177
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,261
All right. I'll do it.

178
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,765
-Hello, old ma'am.
-Oh, hello.

179
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,602
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

180
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,561
Yes,

181
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,606
and she exploded?

182
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,524
Doris exploded?

183
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,027
-You just got prov'd!
-In your face, lady!

184
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,279
The streets are ours!

185
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,531
-Hurray, improv! I did it!
-You have briefly won me over.

186
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,370
Poor Doris...

187
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,666
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

188
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,836
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,
but we do get by.

189
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,339
-Oh, stop. [laughs]
-Bam!

190
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,383
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

191
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,301
He said "bam."

192
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,011
I don't know who Emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

193
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,679
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

194
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,933
BoJack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

195
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,935
One week left!

196
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,813
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

197
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,150
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

198
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,860
because BoJack's doing a play there
after you finish.

199
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,237
-Oh, I love plays.
-A play.

200
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,864
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

201
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,826
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

202
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,202
Oh?

203
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,039
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

204
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,208
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

205
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,462
-What?
-Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

206
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,796
Like shipshape? [giggles]

207
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,132
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

208
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,967
-Okay, moving on.
-Hey, it's fine.

209
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,385
Abe knows what we're making.

210
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:54,970
Right?

211
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,096
[Abe slurps]

212
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,933
-Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
-Uh, okay.

213
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,272
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

214
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,650
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

215
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,861
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

216
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,779
-Are you kidding?
-Well, you know,

217
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,907
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

218
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,535
Did that hurt your feelings?

219
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,371
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.

220
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,708
Right, because Casablanca is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

221
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,378
This movie's about Secretariat,
a racehorse.

222
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,757
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?

223
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,761
That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca?

224
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,516
-This is a different movie.
-I think there was a misunderstanding.

225
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,768
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

226
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,439
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

227
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,983
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

228
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,027
-You know what I think? You're shit.
-What?

229
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,155
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

230
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,657
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

231
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,913
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

232
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,624
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

233
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,377
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

234
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,589
Because it's a different kind of pie?

235
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
[slurs] That's right.

236
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,969
Why did you have to antagonize him?

237
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,763
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

238
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,100
-He said, "It's no Casablanca."
-Well, what's done is done.

239
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,644
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

240
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,145
Lucky me, I get to stay here

241
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,565
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

242
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,691
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

243
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,153
Or you could sulk about it.

244
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,821
Diane does raise some good points.

245
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,822
No, she doesn't.

246
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,993
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

247
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,497
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

248
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,709
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

249
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,962
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

250
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:57,217
-I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
-No one cares, Todd.

251
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,011
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

252
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,764
-Stop.
-Aah. Sorry, officer,

253
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,183
I didn't see that stop sign.

254
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,644
Yes.

255
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,061
And my car runs on farts.

256
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,020
-[Todd mimics farting]
-[Wanda] Ugh!

257
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,106
-Stop. No, stop it.
-Please stop.

258
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,316
Not a suggestion.

259
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,317
[mimics farting]

260
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,736
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

261
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,572
I want to become a Level Two,

262
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:23,410
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

263
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,329
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,956
What? No, improv is not a cult.

265
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,874
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

266
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,127
taught by a for-profit organization

267
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,005
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

268
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,716
-Ahh.
-It's a cult. And I know.

269
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,970
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.

270
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,723
Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.

271
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,808
Wait, are you saying
Scientology is a cult?

272
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,811
No, Scientology is not a cult.

273
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,355
Improv is a cult.

274
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,275
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

275
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,945
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
-Why does anything matter, right?

276
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,198
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

277
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,660
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

278
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,745
Allegedly.

279
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,580
Would you talk to her?

280
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,623
[sighs] Yes.

281
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,711
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

282
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,505
Heyyy... Hitler.

283
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,506
Please stop.

284
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,799
[panting]

285
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,012
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

286
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,430
[all] Fire hose!

287
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,391
[grunts] Sorry I'm late, guys!

288
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,477
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at Shenanigags.

289
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:34,981
-If you miss one more class, you're out.
-I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

290
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,109
-He's later than I am.
-Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

291
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,863
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

292
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,576
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.

293
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,246
-Is that a reward or a punishment?
-That's up to Bryan.

294
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,665
Let's have no more questions
about the Giggleship.

295
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, uh, all right.

296
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,503
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

297
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,757
and he said improv is a cult.

298
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,675
I mean, that's crazy, right?

299
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,679
[all laughing]

300
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,097
[coughs]

301
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,016
If you think Shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

302
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,686
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

303
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,689
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

304
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,609
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

305
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,402
Invite him to your graduation show.

306
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,947
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

307
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,658
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

308
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,328
[groans] I hate good hard thinks.

309
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,376
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I-- I gotta go.

310
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,379
I'm--
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

311
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,215
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

312
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,467
Uh, okay, bye.

313
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,843
So, hey, hi.

314
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,096
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

315
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,266
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

316
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,934
No one is making me do anything.

317
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,103
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

318
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,062
Well, yeah.

319
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,984
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

320
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,528
and be this best possible version
of myself.

321
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,613
And what happened?

322
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,281
I couldn't.

323
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,575
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

324
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,829
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

325
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,874
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

326
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,376
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

327
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,087
-with his girlfriend "Susie Side."
-Yeesh.

328
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,341
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

329
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,051
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of Horsin' Around.

330
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:27,969
Hmm.

331
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,220
[audience laughs]

332
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,515
And if I hear one more peep out of you--

333
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,391
-[crashing]
-[audience laughs]

334
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,895
-Sabrina!
-[Sabrina] What? I didn't peep!

335
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,856
Oh!

336
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,190
[audience applauding]

337
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,651
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

338
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,195
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

339
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,824
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.

340
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,074
Did you go to work today?

341
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,786
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

342
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,204
so why bother doing anything?

343
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,498
-True story.
-Okay.

344
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,458
[the horse] Oh, you didn't.

345
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,710
[audience laughing]

346
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,712
Oh, you did.

347
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,338
[sitcom theme plays over TV]

348
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,844
-Hello.
-Hey, could you get the door?

349
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,637
-Whoa.
-Mm.

350
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,473
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

351
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,559
to get everything we need
out of this place.

352
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,476
Mm. Perfect.

353
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,521
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

354
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,606
-What?
-Just until the divorce is finalized.

355
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,983
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

356
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,984
They're hawks.

357
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,195
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

358
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,239
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

359
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,448
Rutabaga, this is too--

360
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,910
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

361
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,579
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

362
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,496
Mm. Mm.

363
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,165
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just-- Ooh.

364
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,000
-Oh, hello.
-Look at this urn.

365
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,794
What's going on in here?

366
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,504
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

367
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:49,885
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

368
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,137
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

369
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,516
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

370
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,684
Are you in or out?

371
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,685
Are you kidding?

372
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,855
You're the agent who got me
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.

373
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,273
-Well--
-What do they know?

374
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,900
-Right, so--
-Do they know things?

375
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,276
-Okay--
-Let's find out.

376
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,694
-Right--
-Big fan.

377
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,987
I like you guys.

378
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,656
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

379
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,199
-Well, um--
-I am in.

380
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,367
Mm-hm.

381
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,080
Go home, Goober.

382
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,290
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

383
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,251
[coughs] Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?

384
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,378
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

385
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,672
-You suck, Goober!
-Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

386
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,174
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

387
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,928
-Hey, guys.
-Shut up, Todd.

388
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,388
BoJack, listen, I-- Oh!

389
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,766
-Hey, whoa!
-Boo! Party foul!

390
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,018
-You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.
-Come on!

391
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,937
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

392
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,565
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

393
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,900
Clean up your shit, Todd.

394
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,696
BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

395
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,698
-What?
-Look, I know you think

396
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,910
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

397
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,621
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

398
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,334
[groans] I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.

399
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,505
And here I am going downstairs.

400
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,757
[cell phone ringing]

401
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,675
Hello?

402
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,804
-What kind of pants are you wearing now?
-What? I don't know. The normal kind.

403
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,765
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

404
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,391
I guess. Why?

405
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,811
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

406
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,272
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

407
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,108
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

408
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,361
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

409
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,738
-This is serious.
-We're not just doing bits?

410
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,490
You started it with the pants thing.

411
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,118
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

412
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,119
[sighs]

413
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,330
Remember, you wanted this.

414
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,295
Are you saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

415
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,882
Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,

416
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,633
but I'm tired of running in circles.

417
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,551
[Abe] Cut!

418
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,261
Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.

419
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:02,392
-Anything you want me to do differently?
-No, I just think we should get it again.

420
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,268
You know, for safety.

421
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,146
-Action!
-I'm tired of running in circles.

422
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,815
[slurps] And again?

423
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,567
I'm tired of running in circles.

424
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,152
Why don't we get it like five more times?

425
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,154
I'm tired of running in circles.

426
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,365
I'm tired of running in circles.

427
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,576
I'm tired of running in circles.

428
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,786
I'm tired of running in circles.

429
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,830
I'm tired of running in circles.

430
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,083
[Abe] Let's get it ten more times.

431
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,166
[sighs]

432
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,714
-Ta-da!
-We did it.

433
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,092
-What now?
-We die, have our guts ripped out

434
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,095
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

435
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,263
Hey, BoJack,
can I talk to you for a minute?

436
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,473
Ooh...

437
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,683
Alone, please?

438
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,561
Oh...

439
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,897
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

440
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,356
-Right now. You and me.
-What?

441
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,443
I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.

442
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,694
Where? Why?

443
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,071
Less asking, more basking.

444
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,281
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

445
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,992
-I'm not really in the mood for--
-I think some time away

446
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,578
could be really good for us, as a couple.

447
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,537
Oh.

448
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,248
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

449
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,252
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

450
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,004
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

451
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,132
and you just want me
to put on a happy face--

452
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,718
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

453
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,012
Doesn't mean
they have to bring it home with--

454
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,682
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-What is that supposed to mean?

455
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,977
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

456
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,728
You don't give a shit about work.

457
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,564
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

458
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,150
What? You have a lot of pride?

459
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,693
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

460
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,404
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

461
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,699
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

462
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,410
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

463
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,245
in Beverly Garbage
and spend the rest of your life

464
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,500
-watching your former assistant's garbage.
-I don't know where this is coming from.

465
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,586
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

466
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,755
because of network executives like me.

467
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,883
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career--

468
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,595
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

469
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,097
-You don't know--
-I don't?

470
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,934
My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.

471
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,938
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

472
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,900
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

473
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,820
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

474
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,405
Well then, what are you doing here?

475
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,034
What happened, BoJack?

476
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,661
Same thing that always happens.

477
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,706
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

478
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,791
And now you know me.

479
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:38,131
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through rose-colored glasses,

480
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,009
all the red flags just look like flags.

481
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,018
-So, Wanda's moving out.
-Oh, shit. Because of me?

482
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,686
No. Because of me.

483
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,190
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of Horsin' Around?

484
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,776
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

485
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,738
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

486
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,740
Why won't you go home?

487
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,617
I should. I know I should.

488
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,704
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

489
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,499
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

490
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,586
He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,

491
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,672
"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"

492
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,799
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

493
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,386
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

494
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,347
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

495
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,516
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

496
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,353
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

497
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,232
I would just say, "My day was good."

498
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,859
And he would say, "I love you."

499
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,281
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

500
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,490
Can I ask you something?

501
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:50,078
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

502
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,164
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

503
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,707
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

504
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,085
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

505
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,753
would that have made you happy?

506
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,130
For a little bit.

507
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,464
But then...

508
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,174
Probably...

509
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,219
So, what does it matter?

510
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,264
But there has to be more.

511
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:13,434
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

512
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,158
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

513
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,367
[all] Microchip.

514
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,035
[laughs]

515
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,078
Ah.

516
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,205
[audience applauding]

517
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,083
[sighs]

518
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,921
[doorbell rings]

519
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:44,799
Oh.

520
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,887
[all] Todd!

521
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,348
-[Todd groans]
-[all laughing]

522
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,808
[laughs] Yeah.

523
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,396
Oh.

524
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,564
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

525
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,359
Hey. How are you?

526
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,402
I can't do this anymore.

527
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,570
You can't do what anymore?

528
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,324
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

529
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,616
It's too hard.

530
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,535
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

531
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:15,746
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

532
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,958
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

533
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,003
But listen, I love you. Okay?

534
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,254
Mr. Peanutbutter?

535
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,549
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

536
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,758
I love you, Diane.

537
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,887
-Where is he?
-I don't know, sir.

538
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,764
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?
