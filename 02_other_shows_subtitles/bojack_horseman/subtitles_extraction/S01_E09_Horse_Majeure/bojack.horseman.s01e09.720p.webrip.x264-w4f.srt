00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh, ho, with a resume like this,

166
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,180
you should be the one hiring a driver.

167
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,681
[laughs] Just kidding.

168
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:33,891
I know it's my resume.

169
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,350
But I see you went to Northwestern.

170
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,186
You know, I'm an N.U. man myself.

171
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,021
Go, fighting Westerns.

172
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:40,397
And it says here you do

173
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
a great Rodney Dangerfield impression.

174
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:43,525
Give us a taste.

175
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,110
Uh, okay.

176
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,238
"I'm Roger Dangerfield."

177
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,656
[laughs] No respect, indeed.

178
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,868
Todd, you got the job.

179
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,411
Oh.

180
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,621
Can you believe this weather we're having?

181
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,499
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

182
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,001
[laughs]

183
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,087
Oh, wow. We make a great pair.

184
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,965
It's like I'm Miss Daisy,
and you're Minnie Driver.

185
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,843
[lawn mower rattling]

186
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,511
- [phone beeps]
- Hey, I'm bored.

187
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,513
And I think Todd swallowed a cyanide pill

188
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,723
and might be dead.

189
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:15,974
Wanna come over and bang it out?

190
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,517
Appealing as that sounds,

191
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,394
I have lunch plans with Vincent.

192
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,396
I know that might be hard for you to hear.

193
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,899
Wait, that guy from the bar
who is actually three boys

194
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,026
stacked on top of each
other under a trench coat?

195
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,070
Well, don't fly into a
jealous rage about it.

196
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,154
Not jealous.

197
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,614
Just reminding you that you are trying

198
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,116
to have a relationship
with someone who is...

199
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,284
and again, it's bizarre

200
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,452
I should have to point
this out... three young boys

201
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,746
stacked on top of each
other under a trench coat.

202
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,831
He listens to me.

203
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,541
Okay, okay, but can you
just acknowledge that...

204
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,876
- That you are being jealous?
- Oh, oh!

205
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,211
- [glass shatters]
- Already acknowledged.

206
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,796
- Toodles.
- [phone beeps]

207
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,965
- Look who's not dead.
- Better than not dead.

208
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,176
You are looking at
Mr.Peanutbutter's new driver.

209
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,470
You're his driver? That's perfect.

210
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,431
Now you can infiltrate Mr.
Peanutbutter's inner circle.

211
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,267
I don't know, BoJack.

212
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,517
Sure, you'll act all friendly,

213
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,312
gain his trust, chauffer him around

214
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,521
on his little errands to
the groomer and whatnot,

215
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,690
but all the while, you'll be studying him,

216
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,484
scouring out his weaknesses,

217
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,362
biding your time till
we're ready to strike.

218
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,948
And once you zero in on his Achilles' heel,

219
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:17,202
we will take... him... down.

220
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:20,122
Hooray. Betrayal.

221
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:24,001
[warbling]

222
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,294
Oh, man. Oh, man.

223
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:26,711
- Keep it cool, Todd.
- Hey, pal.

224
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,546
If you're making small talk up there,

225
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,008
how about sending a little my way?

226
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,969
Um... can you believe
this weather we're having?

227
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:38,640
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

228
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,019
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

229
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,103
Hey, weren't you supposed to be here

230
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:44,604
like a half hour ago?

231
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,149
Yeah, I've just been sitting in my car.

232
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:48,483
[chuckles]

233
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,485
Listen, I was looking over my notes,

234
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,612
and I think I have enough
to go write the book,

235
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:56,867
so... I'm just going to do that.

236
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,869
You don't want to interview me anymore?

237
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,787
But don't you want to
know what my Rosebud is?

238
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,914
You told me repeatedly
it was the nudie magazine

239
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,624
your uncle showed you with
the three-nippled woman.

240
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,626
- Who was she?
- I got it all.

241
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,752
Oh, okay.

242
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:09,629
Well, I'll see you around though, right?

243
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:12,216
Yeah. I, um...

244
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,093
Why did you have to make
things weird, BoJack?

245
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,513
[car door opens, closes]

246
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,932
I made things weird?

247
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:22,809
[Mr. Peanutbutter] So if you see anything

248
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,644
you know we need, like this biscuit warmer,

249
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,563
you just run the laser over the barcode,

250
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:27,647
- and kablamsky!
- [beep]

251
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,066
It goes in the registry.

252
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,608
And that way, everybody knows what I want.

253
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,319
- And I know what I want.
- Uh...

254
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,778
Which is what everyone wants.

255
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:35,155
And it's really clear,

256
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,781
and nobody's confused about anything.

257
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,451
Am I crazy, or are you not into this?

258
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,703
No, I am. It's just... [sighs]

259
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,664
The big wedding in Nantucket,
all these presents...

260
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,541
I'm so overwhelmed, I can barely consider

261
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:49,044
whether I want or need a biscuit warmer,

262
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,921
which I think is how people
end up with biscuit warmers.

263
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,090
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

264
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,883
Close your eyes. Come on.

265
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,676
Okay, picture our lives together.

266
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,054
It's a cold Sunday morning
a bunch of years from now.

267
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:01,223
Maybe robots have taken
over, maybe they haven't.

268
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,349
I don't know. It's the future.

269
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,934
This story isn't about that.

270
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,894
The important thing is it's Sunday morning.

271
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,439
I brought you the paper,
fetched your slippers.

272
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,649
You come into the kitchen...
Can you smell biscuits?

273
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,069
- Yes.
- So can I.

274
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:15,695
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

275
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,781
Well, that's all a biscuit warmer's for.

276
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,699
Look, if marriage stresses you out,

277
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,326
we don't have to get married.

278
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,827
It's not the marriage.

279
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,497
It's the wedding and the year of build-up.

280
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,998
So forget all that.

281
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,208
I've done the whole big wedding thing.

282
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,667
I don't need to do it again.

283
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,420
Let's do something small and casual

284
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,004
right here in town next month.

285
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:35,340
Honestly, that would be amazing.

286
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:37,092
But we'd have to cancel the doves,

287
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,593
and we wouldn't be able to send out

288
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:40,095
those fancy invitations you liked.

289
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,139
Those doves were being jerks anyway.

290
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,932
And invitations... They're just a scam

291
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,393
made up by the Post
Office to keep tabs on us.

292
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,602
Post Office.

293
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,438
- [growls]
- Settle down, boy.

294
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,565
[Todd] And then we talked about
his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

295
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,818
[crunching] And... Oh, oh.

296
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,113
And then that led to a whole
conversations about sticks.

297
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,157
Oh, and let me tell you,

298
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,411
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some
serious opinions about sticks.

299
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,954
Why are you telling me this?

300
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,580
What? You said you wanted every detail.

301
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,082
Did I mention he got a new bandana?

302
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,417
Give me something I can use

303
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,918
to make them call off their wedding.

304
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,504
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you?

305
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,712
They called off their wedding.

306
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,589
What? Thank God!

307
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,716
Oh, the universe makes sense.

308
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,511
They decided against a
big destination wedding,

309
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:21,719
so they're doing it here

310
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:22,971
- sometime next month.
- What?

311
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,556
I guess saying they called it off

312
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,890
is probably not right.

313
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:26,975
[groans]

314
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:29,227
[ominous music]

315
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,645
Hey, what's this?

316
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,730
Oh, yes, I got jury duty,

317
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:34,065
but I can't worry about that right now.

318
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,608
That is a problem for Friday BoJack.

319
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,944
Now think, Todd. Gotta
have something I can use

320
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,489
sloshing around in that
pot-infused Jell-O shot

321
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,366
- you call a brain.
- Let's see.

322
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,994
Mr. Peanutbutter likes
having his tummy scratched,

323
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,996
and Diane's family is from Vietnam,

324
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,375
which is where Vietnamese food comes from,

325
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,751
and since that goes in your tummy...

326
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,379
Okay, stop thinking. Just give me raw data.

327
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:56,588
What's happening this week?

328
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,298
Well, the circus is in town.

329
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,175
Congress is going to vote
on the new Education Bill...

330
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,593
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

331
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,927
What's happening with Mr. Peanutbutter?

332
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,222
Well, I'm taking Diane and him

333
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:06,890
to the bank on Thursday.

334
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:10,018
I can use that. I can actually use that.

335
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,271
I don't know if I'm up

336
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,566
for staging a bank robbery, BoJack.

337
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,735
Oh, come on, character
actress Margo Martindale.

338
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,944
They say that there are no good parts

339
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,321
for women over 50.

340
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,614
I want to stick an AK-47

341
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,324
in your hand and prove them wrong.

342
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,117
I do tire of the limitations

343
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,911
of stage, film, and television.

344
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,787
You might as well perform
in a cage, am I right?

345
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:31,248
This is guerilla theater...

346
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,333
No stage, no script, no net.

347
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,043
It's the kind of work we talked about

348
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,045
doing that night in the desert.

349
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:39,631
Don't tell me we left those
dreams in the sweat lodge.

350
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,592
- Hell, I'll do it.
- [dishes clatter]

351
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:45,429
And that little boy never found his mother.

352
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:46,471
Hey, guys.

353
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:47,972
BoJack Horseman?

354
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,349
Oh. Hi.

355
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,642
What a weird coincidence.

356
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,227
I did not know you would be here today.

357
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,521
How are... things?

358
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,897
Things are good. You?

359
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,315
Things good with you?

360
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,567
Hands behind your head, everybody.

361
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,902
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

362
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,154
- [gasps]
- What an unfortunate surprise.

363
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,365
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

364
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,866
- [gasps]
- [coughs] This one.

365
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,244
Well, well, isn't that a pretty ring?

366
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,621
I'll take it.

367
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:11,996
But it's my engagement ring.

368
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,331
Give it to her, Diane.

369
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,041
- It's just a ring.
- Just a ring?

370
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,335
That ring is a symbol of your love.

371
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,170
If you don't care about the ring,

372
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,214
it really makes me wonder if you care about

373
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,924
the woman wearing it.

374
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,259
That terrifying bank robber

375
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:26,219
is making some very cogent points.

376
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,845
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

377
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,223
If the ring is just a symbol for love,

378
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,600
why would I need a symbol

379
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,310
when I have the real thing right here?

380
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:35,479
Yeah, we don't need
rings, we have each other.

381
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:38,106
Hey, why are we even waiting
a month to get married?

382
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,692
If anything, this bank
robbery is reminding me

383
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:42,319
that life is short.

384
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:43,861
We should get married even sooner!

385
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,071
[softly] No...

386
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,239
What do you mean sooner?

387
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,407
Why not this weekend?

388
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,284
We could get married Saturday.

389
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,577
Am I crazy?

390
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,329
[softly] Yes. Don't do it.

391
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:54,956
- Oh, keep the damn thing.
- Aw.

392
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,207
[applause]

393
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,293
Okay. Saturday it is.

394
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,628
What the hell just happened?

395
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,588
Something truly beauti...

396
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:02,714
Aah!

397
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:03,965
- Oh.
- Get your hands off me!

398
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:05,049
- [Taser
crackles] - Uh-oh.

399
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,635
[landing blows]

400
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,887
[laughs] Long story short,

401
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,598
Erica did have to lose the foot,

402
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,975
but she gained a friend.

403
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,852
Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there.

404
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,395
Diane and I wanna thank you all

405
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,814
for coming to our
impromptu rehearsal dinner,

406
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,692
even though we did not actually have time

407
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,943
- to organize a rehearsal.
- Or a dinner.

408
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:26,237
But there is an open bar...

409
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,698
[cheers and applause]

410
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,324
which you are all welcome to partake in

411
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,159
as soon as I finish this toast,

412
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:34,538
which I will be doing right...

413
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:35,913
after one more quick anecdote.

414
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,374
- [guests groan]
- It was winter in Prague,

415
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,209
and the consumption hung low in the air.

416
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,418
Well, the bank thing was a dud.

417
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,753
Thanks a lot, Todd.

418
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,213
Well, you win some, you lose some.

419
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:44,715
It's like Vincent always says...

420
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,090
- "Oopsy."
- Vincent?

421
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,509
Yeah, Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

422
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:49,093
We've hung out a couple times.

423
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,887
- What are you ta...
- That dude is funny.

424
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,597
You know he's not a person, right?

425
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,890
Look, I don't want to get

426
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,099
in the middle of your whole thing

427
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,351
with Princess Carolyn.

428
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,686
It's not about that.

429
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,936
I just don't understand why nobody else

430
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,480
seems to notice that she is dating a man

431
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,939
who is clearly three little boys

432
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:04,025
doing the thing from The Little Rascals.

433
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,985
Oh, that reminds me of another funny story.

434
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:08,029
[clinks glass] If I could say a few words?

435
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:10,365
BoJack Horseman. Take the mic.

436
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,742
Spin us a yarn.

437
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,368
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

438
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,911
Since I am friends with both of you

439
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,954
- and have no ulterior motives...
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,373
I would like to offer my restaurant

441
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,791
as a venue for your wedding.

442
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,459
Wow! Really?

443
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,420
I don't know. That's too generous.

444
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:26,548
Hey, don't look a horse's
gift in the mouth, right?

445
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:27,758
[laughter]

446
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,884
I get it. Like the song.

447
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:30,968
That's not a song.

448
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,387
All right, everyone.

449
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,638
That's it for the toasts.

450
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,433
Enjoy yourselves and each other.

451
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,393
[dance music plays]

452
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,936
This is perfect.

453
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,688
Now that the wedding's at my restaurant,

454
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,648
we have the home field advantage.

455
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,233
Perfect for sabotage.

456
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,402
BoJack, I need to thank you.

457
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,613
You calling me to the bar the other night

458
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:50,905
turned out to be the best thing

459
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:52,073
that ever happened to me.

460
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:53,617
- I think I'm in love.
- Okay.

461
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,201
This "person" you're in love with...

462
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,953
Have you seen him without
his trench coat on?

463
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,747
I don't understand why
you can't be happy for me.

464
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,331
He's a good boyfriend.

465
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:01,916
I actually think you and Vincent

466
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,168
would really hit it off
if you gave him a chance.

467
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:06,087
You should spend some
one-on-one time with him.

468
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,505
You mean
one-on-three time?

469
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,173
Because there are three of him.

470
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,092
We get it. You don't like him.

471
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,636
I'm actually not sure you do get it.

472
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,139
- [unzips]
- I know what's been going on.

473
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,557
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.

474
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:18,975
I was just taking my penis out.

475
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,685
You've been driving me around,

476
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,687
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

477
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:23,855
I see it now.

478
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,774
What are you talking about?

479
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:28,777
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

480
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,362
You were becoming my friend.

481
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,782
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

482
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,784
Well, I could use a friend right about now.

483
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,786
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

484
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:41,414
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

485
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,958
No, I'm not great with
sensitive information.

486
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,002
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

487
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,921
Don't get me wrong. I love Diane so much.

488
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,089
I didn't have any doubts

489
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,342
until I realized she had doubts.

490
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,719
Then I figured she's smarter than I am.

491
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,137
Maybe she knows things I don't.

492
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,639
You are kind of unloading

493
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,683
a lot of sensitive information here.

494
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,768
Sure, I think I'm ready to commit to Diane,

495
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:04,020
but I can't even commit to
my favorite type of stick.

496
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:07,357
Yes, today, it's short
and knobby, but tomorrow?

497
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,026
Well, sure, Diane is short,
but I don't know about knobby.

498
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,111
The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane,

499
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,405
but I keep having this
dream where she's gone.

500
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:16,115
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

501
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,576
She's just gone, and my
life continues without her.

502
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,328
And it terrifies me to say this,

503
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:23,206
but in the dream I feel... relief.

504
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,750
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.

508
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:32,924

[newsman] Beloved character
actress Margo Martindale

520
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,321
is in police custody tonight

521
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:57,574
for her role in a failed bank robbery.

522
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,075
Margo Martindale?

But first, pizza for breakfast?

The answer might surprise you.

I know her, but how? Wait.

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,377
She was at the convenience store

527
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,170
the night I bought that video game

528
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:13,130
and ruined my rock opera.

529
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,883
She's the one who asked me

530
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:18,010
to hand her that tape from the 10¢ bin.

531
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:22,682
[gasps] That means Margo
Martindale likes tapes!

532
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,642
And a tape is something you listen to,

533
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:26,477
but tape is also a sticky thing

534
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,438
you can use to seal boxes.

535
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:30,941
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

536
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,610
What does it all mean?

537
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,486
Am I just grasping at straws?

538
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,740
Wait. Straws... That's it.

539
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:42,243
Straws are used to drink soda or water,

540
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,870
and plants need water.

541
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:48,332
And BoJack used Margo Martindale as a plant

542
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:53,212
at the bank and the convenience store,

543

which means... Ugh!

544
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:58,760
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

545
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,762
to make me find that video game

546
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:05,016
so he could kill my rock opera!

one more day to figure out
how to stop this wedding,

Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up.

company. Read your title.

650
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:57,331
"Executive Vice President
of West Coast Operations."

651
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:00,417
Whoa! Does that mean I control the waves?

652
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:02,294
No, it means you're my assistant.

653
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,963
You've got a big future ahead of you,

654
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:05,840
and I don't want you to
waste any time looking back.

655
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,176
So I got all my cars' mirrors taken off.

656
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,927
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

657
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:12,429
What do I care? I'm not driving.

658
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:15,599
Hey, BoJack. Thanks for coming.

659
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,101
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

660
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:18,853
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

661
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:21,564
You're a good friend. I'm
really glad to know you.

662
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:24,067
- Mwah.
- Sorry that I...

663
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,442
If I made things weird.

664
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,237
They weren't that weird.

665
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,821
- Oh.
- [Mr. Peanutbutter] Diane, honey?

666
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,907
Oh, I gotta go dance with my husband.

667
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,242
[squeals]

668
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,951
I'm married! [Giggles]

669
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,329
Hi.

670
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,166
So you're the quote-unquote
person, singular,

671
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,834
that everyone's so crazy about.

672
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:43,460
What have you got figured out that I don't?

673
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:46,256
Um, adult stuff.

674
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,091
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

675
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,884
But that doesn't matter.
Not everything's about me.

676
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,095
And maybe I am a little jealous.

677
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,306
Not because I actually want to
date Princess Carolyn anymore,

678
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:59,310
but just because I don't
like the idea that I can't.

679
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:01,353
I guess I just assumed I always could.

680
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:03,522
But I made a lot of bad decisions.

681
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,150
Not just with her. With... [sighs]

682
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,652
with everyone, really.

683
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,572
You know, Princess Carolyn was right.

684
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,490
- You are a good listener.
- Thanks.

685
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,952
You know, sometimes I feel
like I was born with a leak,

686
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,579
and any goodness I started with just slowly

687
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,581
spilled out of me, and now it's all gone.

688
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:22,458
And I'll never get it back in me.

689
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,210
It's too late.

690
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:28,047
Life is a series of
closing doors, isn't it?

691
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:32,176
Don't be sad.

692
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,220
