-On your way to sea?
-Yes.

Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

119
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,134

-Huh?
-What?

-I mean, he is an adult.
-Uh...

Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

124
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,517
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.

-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

Do your parents really love each other,

132
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,167
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

133
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,002
What? Why would you ask me that?

134
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,921
I don't know. Just making conversation.

135
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,965
-Why do we keep passing the same house?
-No, I don't. Shut up.

136

You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

Okay, fine.

That's Diego Mendoza's house.

He's just this stupid guy.

141
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,062
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

142
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,606
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."

143
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,067
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.

144
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,486
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

145
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,322
-Cool thing.
-So, anyway...

146
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,617
My best friend, Alison F.
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,493
[BoJack] Do I really need
to know these names?

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,750
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,
and I'm like,

151

"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,838
You know I don't know
any of these people, right?

153
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,591
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

154
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,719
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

155
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,056
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill. [chuckles]

156
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,101
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

157
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,146
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

158
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,856
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"That's so funny.

159
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,317
I was just going for a drive."

160
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,069
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."

161
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:45,489
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
-That's the whole plan?

162
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,076
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,579
Dude, what are you really doing here?

164
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,456
[BoJack sighs]

165
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,128
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

166
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,673
And I didn't know where else to go.

167
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,134
-Please do not tell your parents.
-Well, I won't,

168
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,677
but I think people are gonna notice

169
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,971
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

170
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,639
[BoJack sighs]

171
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,308
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

172
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,892
-Oh, my God. Oh!
-What are you doing?

173
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,020
-What happened to your plan?
-Oh! I panicked.

174
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,397
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top. [screams]

175
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,903
-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
-Yeah, deal.

176
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,202
-They didn't even put me in.
-[sighs] I'm sorry, sweetheart.

177
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,037
You did some great cheering
from the bench,

178
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,414
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

179
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,000
-Maybe they'll put me in next game.
-Sure, they will.

180
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,877
[whispering] No way they'll do that.

181
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,794
[truck beeping]

182
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,088
-[Kyle in normal voice] What the...?
-Huh?

183
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,715
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

184
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,050
What a boat.

185
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,344
-Can I go on your boat?
-I don't see what's stopping you.

186
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,596
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,681
Where's your car?

188
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,059
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

189
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,936
-Uh... well--
-[Trip] Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

190
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,315
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

191
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,025
Please stay out of the bedroom.

192
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,484
-Does she have a name?
-Who?

193
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,155
-The boat? It does not.
-Come on. You gotta give her a name.

194
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,366
You should call her the Escape From L.A.

195
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,285
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

196
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,079
Oh, she's a good girl.

197
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,249
[chuckles] I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?

198
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,377
-Or are you a bad girl?
-Are you flirting with my boat right now?

199
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,422
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

200
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,924
-Mind if I get on top of her?
-Knock yourself out.

201
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,508
Dad, don't be gross.

202
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,095
-Wow, you really got a boat.
-Yeah, sure did.

203
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,055
So, does that mean you're leaving?

204
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,639
Oh, I, uh...

205
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,977
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.

206
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,856
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

207
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,609
-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
-Oh, it's no bother.

208
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,780
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

209
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,282
Uh, everyone?

210
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,825
[Kyle] Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

211
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,329
-[Trip] Too late.
-Seriously, stay as long as you want.

212
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,498
[cell phone rings]

213
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,875
-What?
-BoJack, great news.

214
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,544
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill--

215
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,255
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

216
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,216
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral

217
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,551
-and you told me--?
-Whatever it is, I don't care.

218
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,804
[Trip] Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

219
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,431
[Kyle] Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

220
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,432
[family laughs]

221
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,642
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

222
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,020
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

223
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,523
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

224
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,942
-What?
-I think I might be here a while.

225
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,568
Listen, I--

226
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,029
[grunts]

227
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,114
[sighs]

228
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,284
Well, who's getting seasick? [retches]

229
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,535
[family laughs]

230
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,537
Just kidding. [chuckles]

231
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,665
It's such an eyesore.

232
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,294
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

233
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,467
[husband sighs]

234
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,634
BoJack?

235
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,845
-Yeah?
-Supper's ready.

236
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,223
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

237
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,142
They're gonna offer me a position.

238
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,061
-What? That's amazing.
-Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

239
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,065
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

240
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,029
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

241
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,864
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

242
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,993
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

243
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,495
[Kyle snorts, then laughs]

244
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,663
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

245
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,747
[all laugh]

246
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,209
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

247
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,170
A bit is what they call a joke
in show business.

248
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,713
-Right, BoJack?
-That's right.

249
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,424
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

250
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,802
[groans] You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

251
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,888
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

252
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,515
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

253
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,308
Whatever. Get bent.

254
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,519
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

255
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,436
[door slams]

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,979
[BoJack and Charlotte] I'll talk to her.

257
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,272
Everyone said for months

258
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,358
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
-Yeah?

259
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,361
-But he keeps not doing it.
-That is so typical Diego.

260
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,447
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

261
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,115
-Way to take initiative.
-Oh. Rookie mistake.

262
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,867
So, I asked him and he said no.

263
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,621
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

264
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,374
And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.

265
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,626
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

266
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,796
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

267
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,593
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

268
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,303
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

269
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,888
-because you can actually--
-Mom.

270
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,725
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

271
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,311
-and you'd go to your sock hops.
-Do you think

272
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,356
-I went to high school in the '50s?
-Penny, hey, I got an idea.

273
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,899
-You should take me to the prom.
-Huh?

274
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,776
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

275
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,944
What? Why?

276
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,655
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

277
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,449
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

278
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,410
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

279
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,662
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

280
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,414
and that'll make him super jealous.

281
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,916
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "Hey."

282
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,668
And then you say, "Hey."

283
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,670
-Oh, that's so cold.
-Right?

284
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,922
-Wait--
-Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

285
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,300
-How is that cold?
-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

286
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,843
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

287
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,805
And then... never dance with him.

288
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,099
-That'll show him.
-Wait-- I'm sorry.

289
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,851
-Don't you want to dance with Diego?
-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

290
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,354
-This is a great plan.
-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

291
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,565
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

292
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:16,361
Oh, [chuckles] yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

293
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,616
[Kyle] Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

294
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,951
-[all] Cheese.
-I think we have enough pictures.

295
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,454
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

296
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,123
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

297
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,374
And who are you again?

298
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,876
-I'm Maddy.

453
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,920
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

454
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,381
Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.

455
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,716
Okay, that's not--

456
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,468
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

457
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,388
-Penny, no.
-It's okay. I want this.

458
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,431
No, you think you do, but...

459
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,642
You don't know what you want.

460
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,521
Oh, God. [sniffs]

461
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,981
This is so dumb.

462
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,817
-No, Penny, don't--
-I'll see you tomorrow.

463
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,443
[sighs]

464
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,034
Hey.

465
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,619
-What'd you do with my daughter?
-She had a big night.

466
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,664
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

467
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,084
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

468
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,462
-You know you can get your own, right?
-Hey, do you remember that time

469
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,132
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?

470
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,510
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

471
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,887
-Yeah.
-Ooh. That was really bad

472
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,846
for the environment.

473
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,723
-True, but--
-A seagull could've choked

474
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,684
-on one of those balloons.
-But it's a nice memory, right?

475
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,310
It was a fun night.

476
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,438
We had a lot of fun nights.

477
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,858
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

478
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,276
-Do you remember?
-Oh, God.

479
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,487
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

480
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,491
-Well, do you still think it's true?
-Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

481
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,868
No.

482
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,870
No, I think you're the tar pit.

483
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,456
-Me?
-No, not "you" you.

484
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,166
I'm just saying, like...

485
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,169
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

486
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,964
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

487
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,175
or Maine or New Mexico.

488
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,552
You know, you can't escape... you.

489
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,515
-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
-No, what? No, I don't. [laughs]

490
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,309
[Charlotte sighs]

491
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,396
-I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
-About what?

492
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,316
I keep... making these bad decisions.

493
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,569
-And hurting people.
-Well...

494
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,656
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Is it a long joke with no punch line?

495
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,158
-No.
-Then go ahead.

496
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,453
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

497
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,913
You know what the doctor says?

498
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,457
-"Don't do that."
-Yeah.

499
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,669
-That's actually... good advice.
-And you know what else?

500
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,505
The doctor in that story was a woman.

501
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,798
What?!

502
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,050
[BoJack laughs]

503
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,263
[both moan]

504
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,682
[Charlotte gasps]

505
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,809
Oh. BoJack, um...

506
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,645
-I think you got the wrong idea.
-Let's go.

507
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,814
-Let's get out of here right now.
-No, BoJack.

508
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,232
You and me, this is real.

509
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,860
-You know this is real.
-My husband is right upstairs.

510
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,529
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

511
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,323
-Don't do this, BoJack.
-I know you feel it, too.

512
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,742
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

513
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,119
but this is the right thing,

514
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,329
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

515
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,665
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

516
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,876
and imagining what could have been.

517
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,295
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

518
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,589
[Charlotte sighs]

519
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,051
-I think you should go.
-Okay.

520
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:41,968
-Tomorrow.
-Charlotte--

521
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,679
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

522
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,889
I am happy here.

523
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,558
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

524
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,103
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

525
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,479
-I don't know you.
-You do.

526
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,773
I don't. And you don't know me.

527
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,568
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

528
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,695
-I love you, your family and this town.
-Stop.

529
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,446
-I never wanted to hurt--
-BoJack--

530
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

531
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,953
-Everything can go back to normal, but--
-No, no, stop. No.

532
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,497
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

533
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,001
I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.

534
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,754
You make me too sad.

535
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,339
Okay.

536
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,429
What are you doing here?

537
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,348
I know what I want, BoJack.

538
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,645
Go to bed, Penny.

-Now, Penny.

-Charlotte, I am so sorry--
-Don't. Don't you dare.

549
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,696
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,
