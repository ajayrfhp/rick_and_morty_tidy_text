00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,752
people always said I looked like
BoJack Horseman.

154
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,332
- That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!
- [skimmer clatters]

155
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,384
And I've always wondered if BoJack
could be my biological... sperm guy.

156
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,595
I guess it's possible.

157
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,098
BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:

158
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,435
back in the '90s it got into everything.

159
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,604
I came to L.A.
to get to the bottom of things.

160
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,565
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.

161
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,984
Once you have chloroform,
you can't not use it.

162
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,653
No, I get it. BoJack had one
of those spy kits, too.

163
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,573
He mostly just used the chloroform
on himself, though.

164
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,034
I read in his book that you live together.

165
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,162
- Can you help me find him?
- Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

166
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,664
And no one knows where he's been
for the last year.

167
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,500
I guess I don't have to meet him.

168
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,253
All I need is a DNA sample,
like a piece of hair or something.

169
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,714
- I guess his house might have... [gasps]
- [grunts]

170
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,468
- Whoa!
- Sorry again. It's just so fun.

171
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,471
Okay, there might be some hairs
in the shower drain,

172
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,681
but hard to know who they belong to.

173
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,603
Everyone who has sex with BoJack
usually takes a long shower afterwards.

174
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,272
- Hey, I think I see a hair.
- [moaning]

175
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,274
Oh, no, BoJack.

176
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,443
- Yoink!
- What the... was...

177
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,363
- [exhales] Okay.
- Okay, let's blow.

178
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,199
Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. [groans] Huh?

179
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,536
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

180
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,540
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?
And I'm not going to yell at you.

181
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,541
And what is this?

182
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,419
I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-
Guerrero-Robinson-

183
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,671
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

184
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,881
Of the New Haven
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

185
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,633
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?

186
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,595
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never
heard of your family and/or law firm.

187
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,766
That was also a joke. Todd, who is
this tough crowd you brought to my home?

188
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,811
- Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
- Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

189
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,522
Dot-dot maid.

190
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,065
Way to build up the suspense.

191
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,651
To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.

192
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,361
You got me a maid? Thank you.

193
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,365
Here I thought Channing Tatum
was a good neighbor

194
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,073
for picking up my mail while I was gone,

195
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,492
but you, and after all the things
I did to you,

196
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,246
- I don't know how to tell you...
- BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,

197
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,540
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.

198
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,544
So, maybe it's better if we just
keep things like that, you know?

199
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,464
- Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me...
- [grunts]

200
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,215
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

201
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,343
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.

202
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,388
[panting]

203
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,056
Can you tell me if this is a match?

204
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,809
- A match with who?
- Hollyhock.

205
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:07,523
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub
Zoolander-Hallelujah-something-McDonald's?

206
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,067
Whatever those words are,
I need a sample from her, too.

207
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,944
[groans] Duh!

208
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,946
Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.

209
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,365
Nothing like working
with hair, blood, and semen all day

210
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,743
to work up an appetite,
and it's already 1:00.

211
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,454
1:00?
I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!

212
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,331
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?

213
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,083
Mine is a bunch of water balloons
with a blonde wig.

214
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,505
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this

215
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,007
is too fancy for a common man
such as yourself.

216
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,214
No, it's fine.

217
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,053
You'd probably like to take me
someplace rough and primitive.

218
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,680
Uh... do you want me to take you
somewhere else?

219
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,101
Well, if you must drag me on some
barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.

220
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,604
There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.

221
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,773
A chain restaurant?
Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.

222
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,982
I can't do this.

223
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,735
Todd, I can never be
your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.

224
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,779
- I must abscond. [sobs]
- Wait, Courtney!

225
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,200
- [cameras clicking]
- [tires screeching]

226
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,536
Scusi, sir, would you care
for a sample

227
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,830
of my father's famous
angel hair pomodoro?

228
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,458
Famous father? Hair? Sample?

229
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,627
- DNA?
- I no say DNA.

230
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,754
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.

231
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,508
[grunting and panting]

232
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,803
- [door opens]
- Hollyhock, I need to get...

233
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,471
- Did you clean anything?
- No.

234
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,100
But I am learning so much
about my possibly-maybe birth father.

235
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,061
Like, did you know he has a shoebox
in his closet full of bad reviews

236
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,771
for other people's TV shows?

237
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,066
So all you've done so far
is snoop around?

238
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,195
I also ate a box of donuts,
got sleepy and took a nap.

239
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,572
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need
to do this DNA test.

240
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,366
Look, I didn't come all this way

241
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,910
to not find out
who my biological father is.

242
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,539
Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair

243
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,293
- so I can take it down to the lab.
- No way! That sounds painful.

244
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,295
- Can't we just use your hair?
- Um...

245
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,504
- No.
- [panting]

246
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,591
No, but I can pull out some of my hair
at the same time,

247
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,594
- so you don't have to do it alone.
- Okay, that sounds fair.

248
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,804
On three, we pull.

249
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,432
- One... two... three!
- Ow!

250
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,144
Oh, wait, I have this whole comb
full of hair in my bag.

251
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,520
- Duh!
- [sighs]

252
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,814
- Todd, can I see you for a minute?
- [grunts]

253
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,692
This maid is the worst.
I passed out again for some reason.

254
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,135
When I woke up, the house
was messier than when she started.

255
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,155
I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,

256
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,103
in case I start choking on pills
or have a funny take on current events

257
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,036
that demands an audience, but if she
can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

258
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,997
You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,

259
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,959
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,
I'll get the maid to clean

260
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,337
so no one has to fire anyone.

Well, we did it.

What? I'm helping.
I'm cleaning out his DVR. Get it?

for Mr. Peanutbutter?

Yes. Should I have not done the thing
you literally told me to do?

I'm not mad.

what Diane will do when she finds out.

But I've got a plan, and it stars you!

from the TV, radio, and Internet?

Ohh! That's a way better idea than I had.
Yeah, do that.

Well, it's not like nobody
clicks on my articles.

When I need Mr. Peanutbutter

I always hide it in cheese

he's doing something he hates.

330

What if you take your important stuff
and hide it in some juicy gossip?

331
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,192
That's actually a really good idea.

332

you hadn't even written yet.

451
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,587
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

452
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,466
I'd say you're exactly the kind
of journalist we need in this world.

453
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,634
Wow!

454
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,221
That doesn't sound at all
like Channing Tatum's voice,

455
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,517
but that is the kind of thing I would want
Channing Tatum to say to me,

456
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,477
so thanks, Channing.

457
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,728
Love half your movies!

Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.

Oh. So, uh...
what's it like being a movie star?

It's awfully trying.

469
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,510
Do you ever feel like
everyone's looking at you

470

- but nobody sees you?
- Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

471

No, I was speaking rhetorically
about a feeling that only movie stars get.

Ohh.

473
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,687
- Okay.
- But it feels good to talk about it.

474
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,856
Yeah. Talking's good.

475

You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,

I don't know if I'm ready.

Ready for what?

What if it's not everything
I want it to be?

479

Sometimes the idea of something
is better than the truth, you know?

480
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,831
I always prefer fiction to truth,
personally.

I've staked my career on it.

I love how not down-to-earth
you are together.

This is going to really make headlines
when you two break up.

Here's an even bigger headline:
we shan't be breaking up.

No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

494
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,409
- Hollyhock is your daughter.
- What do you mean?

495
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,198
- She's your daughter.
- I don't understand.

00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,664
She has Horseman DNA.
You're her father.

That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

498

She didn't want me to tell you,
but I thought you should know.

499
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,584
I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

BoJack...

I'm supposed to care about.

I had sex with the one person
I've ever seen you be in love with.

I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,

504
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,309
but I don't know that I loved her.

505
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,144
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.

I'm telling you,
it's a million-dollar idea.

I got more of you than I ever deserved.

511
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,740
If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know

512
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,827
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.

It was shitty
what you did with Emily, but, um...

Ohh.

- I'm sure you think that's weird.
- Are you kidding? That's amazing.

521
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,018
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

522
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,145
Maybe then I wouldn't have
a strain of herpes.

- You have multiple strains...
- I know.

The joke only works with the "a".

It actually feels nice
to finally say it out loud.

I am an asexual person.

- That's great.

So if you're not mad about Emily...

to be friends again yet.

- Oh. Okay.
- But we can be more than not-friends.

You know, for an asexual,

more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?
