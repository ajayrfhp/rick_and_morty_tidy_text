When our chicks first hatch,
we lovingly inject them

with natural delicious hormones,

28

No, I don't think so.

- Okay.

Yes, I am holding a Bic pen,

but I don't see how that's
relevant, Mrs. Chavez.

- [clucks]
- Sorry. Becca.

- [clucking]
- She's a charming woman.

177
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:15,502
I do have to look around a little
bit, just so I can say I did my job.

178
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,593
- Uh, don't you need a warrant?
- Only if you're guilty.

[both chuckling]

182
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,153
So, if anyone asks, you
were born in La Jolla.

183
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,182
You majored in Communications at USC,

184
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:38,261
and now you're the booking agent

185
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,841
- for Kings of Leon.
- [clucks]

00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:42,572
- Fine, you also book Beck.
- [Diane] Todd?

00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,653
Aah! I didn't find that
thing in your drawer!

188
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:46,663
Why are the police outside?

189
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,952
Okay. I met this chicken and she
escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,

190
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:51,442
and she doesn't speak English,

191
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,192
but she's my best friend and
the cops are looking for her,

192
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,003
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

193
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:58,743
and I love her, and her
name is Becca. Chickenson.

194
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:01,472
- Todd, breathe.
- But we can't send Becca back.

195
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:04,472
- They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
- [clucks]

196
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,102
- More hormones.
- [clucking]

197
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,682
I have a plan, but we gotta
get her out of here now.

198
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,292
- Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.
- But she needs our help.

199
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,331
Do you know how much
trouble we'd get in?

200
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:17,352
There's a policeman in our front yard.

201
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:20,102
Uh-oh, here comes the
responsible suburban housewife.

Gonna do whatever the man says.

00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:26,283
You're right. Let's get out of here.

205
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:30,113
So, now you're just gonna do
whatever a teenage girl says?

206
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,373
- Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.

Thank you, Becca.

Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:47,393
Just me and my wife, and our
teenage daughter and our maid.

214
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,212
- What? Why am I a maid?
- Silence, maid!

215
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,542
Honey, do you want to sit
in the front or the back?

216
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,812
- [clucks]
- And why not? Maid, you can drive.

217
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,732
Hope there's not too
much traffic on the 134.

218
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:00,523
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

So long. Have a great day.

220
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:06,232
Wait a second. The 134
doesn't go to the beach.

221
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:07,982
Unless you took it to the 10.

222
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,863
But then why wouldn't you
take the 405 to the 10?

223
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,033
Hold on, this pen isn't a Bic.

224
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,822
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

225
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:19,003
Wait! That man's wife was a...

226
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:22,633
chicken!

[news theme music plays]

228

Fowl run afoul. A funky
chicken has flown the coop,

229
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:30,842
and for a concerned
populace, the sky is falling.

230
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:33,133
Michael Morgan, Chicken 4 Dayz CEO,

231
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:36,842
this is a public safety hazard,
and your company is responsible.

232
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:39,812
Admit it, you counted your
chickens before they hatched,

233
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:42,442
and now, those chickens
have come home to roost.

234
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:45,822
Tom, I want to take full
responsibility for this mishap.

235
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,192
That's why, for a
limited time, everybody,

236
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,783
we are offering our special
Full Responsibility Poppers

237
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,793
at participating
restaurants for only $4.99.

238
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,231
Tell me, though, if one sees

239
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:59,543
this delicious escaped
chicken in the street,

240
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,293
should they approach it, or...?

241
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,673
Oh, no. I want to be very clear that
this is not like a friend chicken

242
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,163
you see at school or work.

243
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,263
This is a special kind of food chicken

244
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,842
that has lived its entire life indoors.

245
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,562
This chicken is not socialized
for the outside world.

246
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,643
- Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey-yo!

00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,013
Oh, Tommy.

248
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,153
Look, the safest place for this
chicken right now is with us,

249
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,562
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,

250
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,533
and then press that sludge
into a delicious patty.

251
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,743
I'd like to take this
moment to apologize

252
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:31,153
for the earlier crack about my ex-wife.

253
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:35,192
Shannon, we shared 14
beautiful years together.

254
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,293
How do you respond to allegations

255
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,702
that factory farming is
"torture," or "cruel,"

256
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:44,373
or "like a terrifying movie about
some strange dystopian society,

257
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,253
but in this monster story, the
horrifying monsters are us"?

258
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,722
Relax, Tommy,

259
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:52,852
everything we do is completely
legal and FDA-approved,

260
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:55,102
so, therefore, it is fine.

261
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,722
I have no follow-up questions.

- Okay, Todd, what's your plan?
- What?

263

You said you had a plan.

Oh, yeah. My plan was:
Ask Diane for help.

And now my plan has been completed.

lookout. What do we do?

Hey, geniuses, why don't
we take her to Gentle Farms?

Yeah, no one knows
chicken like chickens!

They couldn't say that in
the ad if it wasn't true.

We're not breaking for lunch yet.

Or we could break for lunch,

281
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,312
and you and I could
get to know each other.

282

The crew has more work to do.

Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

287
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,981
with a "Reelect Al Gore" bumper sticker?

288
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,623
As relevant today as it was then.

289
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:05,253
Are you aware said Volvo is currently
harboring a fugitive chicken,

290
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:08,673
along with a teenage girl,
a small, sprite-like man,

and a maid of some sort?

That's my daughter! Not
the maid. The other one.

I'd wager they're making
a run for Gentle Farms.

Don't worry, though.

No, I'm not. I'm a cannon,

312
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,923
- That's a different thing.
- Now I'm just confused.

313
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:02,472
Is Meow Meow Fuzzyface
a loose cannon or not?

314
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,393
All right, put on a pot of coffee.

315
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,922
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

316
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:08,403
[Stone groans]

317
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:09,942
Aw, man.

318
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,523
So full of burrito. Ooh.

319
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,363
Uh-oh, siesta time.

320
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:18,993
I need to go. Irving ran off
with a fugitive chicken in my car.

321
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,732
We can take my car. This is perfect.

322
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:23,243
Why is this perfect? My
daughter could be in danger.

323
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:26,543
Yes, I agree, but we can use the
car ride to get some one-on-one.

324
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,452
I mean, who is BoJack?

325
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:30,243
I'm sure I can find another ride.

326
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,552
Every second you waste
finding another ride,

327
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:36,503
your daughter gets closer to getting
her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

328
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,263
or worse, death, or slightly
better, teen pregnancy,

329
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,003
or worse again, salmonella.

330
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,462
Okay, fine. Let's go.

331
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,592
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

332
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,222
because we are gonna bond.

333
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,932
Up top? Down low? Either one? Both?

334
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,461
[Diane] Oh, wow, you guys
have a movie night here?

335
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:55,393
- [Todd] Oh...
- And we have 20 acres of pasture,

336
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:58,033
where our chickens
have hours of free play.

337
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:59,863
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

338
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,373
[Levi] She sure will.

339
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:04,753
[both] Because no one
knows chicken like chickens.

340
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,582
Thank you for saving this poultry
from a terrible life at a factory farm.

341
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:09,783
You're a hero.

342
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,743
But what if Chicken 4
Dayz tries to get her back?

343
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,673
Don't you worry about your friend.

344
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:17,432
- That chicken belongs to us now.
- [Diane] Whoa!

345
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,592
- Where'd you get that gun?
- You mean originally, or just now?

346
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,432
- Just now.
- It was in that barrel.

347
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,013
- And what about originally?
- Also that barrel.

348
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,893
Look, Becca, I know this
is hard to understand,

349
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,331
but I have to go, and
you can't come with me.

350
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:31,352
[clucks]

351
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:34,322
No, no, you don't need
to book Beck anymore.

352
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,533
Now you can just be a chicken.

353
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,352
See, this is where you belong, okay?

354
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,373
You hear me? I don't want you no more.

355
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:43,663
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

356
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:47,743
and I never loved you! Now get, Becca!

357
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,653
I said get!

358
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:51,383
[sobbing]

359
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,543
[Becca clucking]

360
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,133
She really stretched out that dress.

361
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:59,472
She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.

362
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,013
So, I'm kind of the reason
Drew Barrymore got sober.

363
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,633
Did you like Never Been
Kissed? If so, you're welcome.

364
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,092
Can we have one conversation
that isn't about you?

365
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:09,552
I don't understand why
you need me to like you.

366
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:12,831
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,

367
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:15,672
because I'd prove my parents
were wrong to never support me,

368
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,302
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,

369
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:19,743
proving I have intrinsic worth,

370
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,822
but it's not a big
deal or anything. Jeez.

371
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:25,153
Great story. You should put that
in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

372
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:27,082
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

373
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,731
It's been screwy since I hit
that deer a couple weeks back.

374
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:31,142
Probably should get it checked out.

375
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,072
[tire blows]

376
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:34,332
[both yelling]

377
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,712
[sighs]

378
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,793
Probably should've
gotten it checked out.

379
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,423
- Those farmers seem nice.
- Yeah.

380
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,842
I think Becca will
be really happy there.

381
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,552
She'll have a nice life.

382
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,592
Yeah, until they kill her.

383
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,113
Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,

384
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,562
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

385
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:00,393
This doesn't feel right.

386
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:02,322
Becca was our friend.

387
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:05,221
- No. We gotta get her back.
- Uh, what do you mean?

388
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,261
Remember when that guy
cocked his gun and said:

389
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:08,903
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

390
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,702
He wasn't doing that because
he likes cocking guns.

391
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,923
- Then we'll just bust her out.
- Todd, there's nothing we can do.

392
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:16,593
Where else would Becca go?

393
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,252
She doesn't even speak English.

394
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:20,012
Well, we gotta do something.

395
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,843
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,

396
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:26,673
but with Becca, I was
responsible for something.

397
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:28,491
I had a purpose.

398
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:32,302
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

399
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,843
[groans]

400
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,791
- [tires screeching]
- [Irving and Todd yell]

401
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,722
- Oh, my God, Diane!
- All right. Let's bust her out.

402
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,573
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

403
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:45,603
- What? No.
- But I really want an iPad.

404
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:48,532
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

405
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:49,732
Don't push it.

406
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:56,113
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose cannon, but he gets results.

407
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,792
- I can live with that.
- Now, you go bust those perps.

408
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,962
You'll need a maverick,
a by-the-book rookie,

409
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,792
and a curmudgeonly veteran
one week from retirement.

410
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,031
Go, go, go!

411
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:05,972
[men speaking indistinctly]

412
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,053
[news theme music plays]

413
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:10,563
We have received word that authorities
are now en route to Gentle Farms

414
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,732
in an attempt to preempt the
pursued poultry at the pass.

415
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:17,353
Do we have a graphic for
this? No? Where's the graphic?

416
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,903
No, I'm not gonna go on
until we have a graphic.

417
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:22,432
So, make one. I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, America,

418
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,782
Randy's gotta figure
out how to do his job.

419
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,982
Because if I don't
have a graphic, Randy,

420
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,863
people who are just tuning in...

421
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,811
Why am I explaining this to you?
This is basic journalistic...

422
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:36,212
I swear to God! We'll be right back!

423
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:42,462
Just got to place the jack
in the right jack apparatus.

424
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:43,952
There, I have got...

425
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,722
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

426
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,393
That was me acting. Pretty
convincing performance, huh?

427
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,643
There's more to me...

428
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,643
Are you capable of experiencing a moment

429
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,372
that you don't then make about you?

430
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,162
What was your plan to get out of here?

431
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,802
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

432
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,802
and I'll give him an
autograph for a tow.

433
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,472
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.

434
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:05,032
Oh, my God. I'm going to
lose custody of my daughter.

435
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,393
The only reason I took
this movie is for her.

436
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,592
This is my one shot
at a big studio movie.

437
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:12,772
If I blow it, I'm back to making
small, critically acclaimed movies

438
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,742
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

439
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,833
You think I want to be an indie darling?

440
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,702
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

441
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:22,742
- Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?
- Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

442
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,212
Indie-darling daughters
don't go to Brown, okay?

443
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:28,262
They end up at cute pat-on-the-back
factories like Vassar,

444
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,752
then move back in with
their indie-darling mothers

445
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:32,712
and make puppet shows
with their tampons,

446
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:34,843
and they get a profile
in New York Magazine,

447
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,313
and the cycle continues.

448
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,643
Oh, my God, I'm a terrible mother.

449
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,903
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

450
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:43,653
and you're not a terrible mother.

451
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:46,853
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

452
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:48,092
And you're the director

453
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,772
of Women Who Love Women
Who Love Recycling.

454
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,782
Give you a lift in exchange
for a couple autographs.

455
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,833
There he is. Right on time.

456
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:01,923
Shh, shh, shh.

457
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:04,553
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta...

458
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,133
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

459
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,792

[gong sounds]

462
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,582
They probably didn't hear that.

463
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,772
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

464

Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

466
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:23,813
called Someone Broke Onto the Farm

467
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,592
and someone just said the titular line?

468
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:26,501
[door opens]

469
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:27,551
[gasps] This way.

470
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,992
- Oh.
- Irving, this isn't safe.

471
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,363
Get in the car, lock the doors.

472
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,313
Don't be a badass and argue with me...

473
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,892
- Yeah, okay, bye!
- Okay.

474
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,083
Go, go, go! [panting]

475
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,252
Uh...

476
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,673
[clucking]

477
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,923
Becca?

478
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,712
Who's making that ruckus
in my chicken coop?

479
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,552
[all clucking loudly]

480
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,002
- Becca, where are you?
- Becca, are you...?

481
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,923
Becca?

482
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,343
Is this you?

483
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:56,432
- [clucks]
- Becca?

484
00:20:56,492 --> 00:21:00,173
To... To... Todd?

485
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,692
Oh, I found her!
Diane! This one's Becca!

486
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,982
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

487
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,813
- They're all Becca.
- Oh.

488
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,242
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.

489
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:11,653
Go, run to freedom!

490
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:14,202
For generations they
will tell your story!

491
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,573
- [Levi] Who goes there?
- Oh, oh, oh, shit!

492
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,333
- We gotta hide!
- Go, go, go!

493
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,311
[Todd panting]

494
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,123
Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe.

495
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:23,202
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

496
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:25,542
[clucking]

497
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,873
- Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!
- Shh.

498
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:34,093
[Levi] Only we know how to care
for these creatures, you hear?

499
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:38,701
Like I say: No one knows
chicken like chickens.

500
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:39,701
- [cocks gun]
- [laughs]

501
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,012
Oh.

502
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:44,853
- Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
- [sighs] It's not your fault.

503
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:47,232
I don't know why I always
get into these messes.

504
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:50,113
You know, sometimes I
feel like my whole life

505
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:53,603
is just a series of
loosely-related wacky misadventures.

506
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:57,532
I think that's just what
being in your 20s is.

507
00:21:57,643 --> 00:21:59,282
- Really?
- Yeah.

508
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:02,333
I'm supposed to be the adult
here, and I'm a total mess.

509
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,613
You kidding? You're the
coolest person I know.

510
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,811
- Really?
- Yeah. You always know what to do,

511
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:08,583
and you don't take shit from anyone.

512
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,042
Is that how you see me?

513
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:13,012
Of course. You're like Lara Croft.

514
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:15,383
In Diane's body.

515
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:18,932
- [Levi cocks gun]
- [Todd whimpering]

516
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:21,002
- This is our chance. Let's go!
- Come on!

517
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,143
[Diane] Go, go, go!

518
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,303
[all gasping]

519
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,103
Please. Take me with you.

520
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:27,563
I hate it here. I don't
want to kill chickens.

521
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:30,823
I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.

522
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:31,942
Oh...

523
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,643
Whoa!

524
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:36,353
I am so sorry.

525
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,532
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

526
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,742
Let's get out of here!

527
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,083
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

528
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:49,462
[siren whoops]

529
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:50,782
[tires screech]

530
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:55,002
Well, well, looks like
birds of a feather...

531
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:56,383
go to jail.

532
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,883
- [clucking]
- Why was he wearing sunglasses

533
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,143
at night?

534
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:05,133
I hope you folks like community service.

535
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,353
- I do.
- What? Oh.

536
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,791
Oh, my God, Irving,
thank God you're safe.

537
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,222
Mom, I'm fine.

538
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:13,692
Stop embarrassing me in
front of my cool friends.

539
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,823
What? Cool?

540
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:19,063
I mean, that's cool
that you think I'm cool.

541
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:21,992
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

542
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:24,221
Hey, this guy. What'd
you get arrested for?

543
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:26,021
- Being too cute?
- [chuckles]

544
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,292
I want to be in his cell.

545
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:28,481
- [chuckles]
- Listen up, everybody.

546
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:31,712
I, famous celebrity BoJack
Horseman, have an announcement.

547
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:33,702
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

548
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:35,663
on account of me being a celebrity.

549
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:38,292
We gracefully accept the
requisite slap on the wrist

550
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:40,502
and a brief, but
ultimately pointless, trial

551
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,133
in the court of public
opinion. Good day.

552
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,501
Well, you are famous, so
you are all free to go.

553
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:47,772
[Stone yells]

554
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,063
- But what about Becca?
- Took care of that, too.

555
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,972
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,

556
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:54,813
and she'll pay off Chicken
4 Dayz to adopt your friend.

557
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,882
Does she have a meadow that
Becca can frolic around in?

558
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:00,642
You think Drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking meadow?

559
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,432
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

560
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,083
I learned something today.

561
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,202
When you think something
isn't about you,

562
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:09,113
you find a way to save the
day and realize that it was,

563
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,481
all along, all about you.

564
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:12,583
[groans]

565
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,862
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

566
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:17,093
- Hooray!
- Yay! I'm great!

567
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:23,792
So, after all that, the
only thing that saved Becca

568
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,182
was that BoJack was
friends with Drew Barrymore?

569
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:28,803
- Yep.
- So, did anything we did matter?

570
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,512
- Nope.
- I think it did.

571
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,403
I think we made a difference.

572
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:34,692
A small one, but a difference.

573
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:37,103
Yeah, I think we did, too.

574
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:40,442
I think we really changed
things for the better.

575
