1
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:08,701
[Princess Carolyn] I got into
this business because I love stories.

2
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:11,218
They comfort us, they inspire us,

3
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,375
they create a context
for how we experience the world.

4
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:16,226
But also, you have to be careful,

5
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,554
because if you spend
a lot of time with stories,

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:22,780
you start to believe that life
is just stories, and it's not.

7
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:26,010
Life is life, and that's so sad,

8
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,930
because there's so little time and...

9
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,556
what are we doing with it?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,101
- [clocks ticking]
- Thank you.

11
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,984
When Princess Carolyn told me

12
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,773
we were pitching
to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

13
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,078
I was excited,

14
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:43,453
because in so many ways,
the story I'm about to tell is about time.

15
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:46,614
And it's about time this story was told.

16
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,282
- Ooh!
- Ahh!

17
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:52,828
[Flip] It's about Detective John Philbert,
a man from another time.

18
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:55,832
[sighs]

19
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:58,543
[Flip] But now he finds himself
in a new time.

20
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,964
- I'm sorry, did you say newt time?
- No, no, new time.

21
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,842
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

22
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,009
No.

23
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:08,893
Unless you want it to be
a time full of newts.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,473
- No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.
- Okay.

25
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,852
He finds himself in a time
he doesn't understand.

26
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,897
- [sighs]
- [phone dialing]

27
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,692
- [man] Don't call this number again.
- Wait. I... I just...

28
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,111
My mother, she's senile,
and she was drugging the coffee.

29
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,404
That's why... Just...

30
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,031
I wanted you to know that
none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

31
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:30,366
[man] Goodbye, BoJack.

32
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:33,744
[Flip] A time in which he is alone.

33
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:37,707
Perhaps, all this time,
he's been alone.

34
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,002
- Except for the newts, right?
- Hmm.

35
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,837
Yeah. Except for the newts.

40
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:43,147
And then it dawns on him,
his partner isn't a ghost.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,273
Or is he?

42
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,817
- Wow!
- As we like to say here,

43
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,779
there are little hand ideas
and big hand ideas.

44
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:52,018
And that's a big hand idea.

45
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,300
And you said BoJack Horseman
is attached?

46
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,218
What? Oh, yeah.
BoJack is attached.

47
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,179
But he's not like "attached" attached.

48
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,889
If you want us
to get somebody better...

49
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,516
Oh, no, no, no.
We love BoJack.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,561
Yeah. We don't wanna do this
without BoJack, just to be clear.

51
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,147
- Well...
- Oh, he's definitely attached.

52
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,025
He signed a contract.
I saw it myself.

53
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,112
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
[gulps]

54
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,702
So if you look to the left, you'll see
a charming little breakfast nook.

55
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,746
- Oh!
- [gasps] Look at that!

56
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,331
But if you want more natural light,

57
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,167
you could knock down that wall
and put in these...

58
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,920
- French doors!
- That is so cool!

59
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,589
- You actually don't have to yell.
- Wait, Diane.

60
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,841
Are we in the same house right now?
I don't see you.

61
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,718
I can hear you.
I think we're close!

62
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,553
You can't see each other
in the program.

63
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,598
So I'm invisible?
Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?

64
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,266
Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

65
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,186
who cannot rest until
his final letter is delivered!

66
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,855
And can I be
Anne of Green Gables?

67
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,565
No, you're both still you.

68
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,442
Diane, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

69
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,777
- Oh, I can step out...
- Sure!

70
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,947
Why don't you meet me
in the guest bathroom? Ow!

71
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,276
- You don't have to.
- Where's...

72
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,700
- Hold on. I think...
- Guys, I can just...

73
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,285
- Here we are.
- Diane?

74
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,121
No. Careful. Okay.

75
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,873
- Do you really love this house?
- Yeah, it's fine.

76
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,250
I didn't love the old house,

77
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,961
but it was your house and I moved in,
and it was great.

78
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,797
But this is an opportunity
to build something together.

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,882
Something that'll last
for the rest of our lives.

80
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,718
Anything you want is gonna be good
with me. Just like your old house.

81
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,221
But I don't want this to just be
another one of my houses.

82
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,181
I want this to be our house.

83
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,642
And it will be,
because we'll both be living in it.

84
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,603
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I don't need anything fancy.

85
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,481
All that matters to me
is that I get to live with you.

86
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,567
- In the real world.
- Oh!

87
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,069
No more campaign,
no more ex-wives.

88
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:40,114
Just Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter,
back to normal.

89
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,825
- For the rest of our lives.
- That sounds great.

90
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,451
- We'll take it.
- One second, though,

91
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,775
- I have to use the bathroom.
- No, no, no, that's not...

92
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,501
You completely humiliated me
in front of Sha Na Na!

93
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,837
[The Horse]
How was I supposed to Sha Na know

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,381
they were going to invite me
on the stage to do a guitar solo?

95
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,091
[Sabrina]
You're supposed to be my dad.

96
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,801
You're supposed to be
looking out for me.

97
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:01,886
[groans]

98
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,689
[Sabrina]
You're the worst dad in the world!

99
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,265
[The Horse] Well, too bad
I'm the only dad you got.

100
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,683
[Sabrina grunts]

101
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,351
- [doorbell chimes]
- [both] Huh?

102
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,189
[The Horse] O.J. Simpson lawyer
and DNA expert Barry Scheck?

103
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,400
- [Scheck] My car broke down.
- [Sabrina] What?

104
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,652
[Scheck] I guess it ran out of... juice.

105
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,905
Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

106
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,448
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.

107
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,325
Don't put me on hold.
Just take a message...

108
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,118
[Sabrina] Wait, wait!
You're a DNA expert?

109
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:29,121
Could I use DNA
to find my real family?

110
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,916
[Scheck] Well, sometimes,
DNA can be a tricky thing.

111
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,500
Like, for example,

112
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,379
was Simpson DNA found at the scene
of the murder of Nicole Brown?

113
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,799
Sure. Was it O.J. Simpson's DNA?

114
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,092
- Who's to say?
- Oh.

115
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,804
Maybe it was some other Simpson,
like his son, or his father.

116
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,891
There's no way to know.
I wouldn't worry about it.

117
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,476
That's too much, man...

118
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,690
[doorbell chimes]

119
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,570
- Oh.
- Hey, buddy.

120
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,240
- Uh-oh.
- She had a long day... of drinking.

121
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,200
I figured she shouldn't
drive herself home.

122
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,493
- Good thinking.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,370
I was right too,
because she crashed her car.

124
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,496
What?

125
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,623
I probably should've
said something, but...

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,337
You need to get your shit together.

127
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,755
Wha... Where am I?

128
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,925
Okay, so you know how you're always
giving pep talks to people,

129
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,219
telling them they need
to get their shit together?

130
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,932
Well, this is me giving you
the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

131
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:34,812
- Why am I tied up in the woods?
- So you can't escape my wise words.

132
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,855
Is that not part of it?
I couldn't remember.

133
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,149
It doesn't matter.
It's all over for me.

134
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,318
When it gets out
I faked BoJack's signature,

135
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,112
the deal's gonna fall apart.

136
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,447
There goes my reputation, my career...

137
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,909
Well, there's more to life
than just your career, isn't there?

138
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,369
- Is there?
- Isn't there?

139
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,662
I have nothing!

140
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,707
Oh! This pep talk is going
in the wrong direction.

141
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,418
Do you know how hard it is
to start a family at my age?

142
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,838
- To find a guy at my age?
- You don't need a guy to start a family.

143
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,841
You're Princess Carolyn.
You can do anything.

144
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,342
No, I can't.

145
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,472
Look, the woods are dark and scary,

146
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,607
but the only way out is through.

147
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,143
I'm sorry.
I got distracted by the woods.

148
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,062
- Um, what were we talking about?
- No, you're right.

149
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,398
The only way out is through.

150
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,776
I gotta talk to BoJack.
I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

151
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,069
I'm Princess Carolyn.

152
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,237
That's the spirit!

153
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,991
As my blood type always says,
"B" positive!

154
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,409
- What was that?
- I don't know.

155
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,077
- Oh!
- Oh!

156
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,204
- Hey, Doctor Picarello.
- [groaning]

157
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,914
Doctor Picarello, are you okay?

158
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,041
- [growling]
- Todd?

159
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:41,045
- [all snarling]
- [drill whirring]

160
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,508
So it turns out Vice Chancellor
Laughing Gassy got rabies

161
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,510
from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

162
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,348
And then he started biting everyone,
and now a bunch of them have rabies.

163
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,059
Who could have predicted
my innocent clown dentist venture

164
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:59,021
- could turn into something so terrifying?
- I don't see how this concerns me.

165
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,066
Yolanda, the only reason
they're in the woods at all

166
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,192
is because of you.

167
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:06,602
If people find out the Better
Business Bureau is behind this,

168
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,337
you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

169
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:11,325
from the Business Branch
of the Board of Better Bureaus?

170
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,244
You're right! We have to do something
before someone gets hurt.

171
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,456
Call me four out of five dentists,
because I agree.

172
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,762
What?

173
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,214
Here we are.
The rest of our lives.

174
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,466
Yeah, wow.

175
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,927
- Do you wanna go to Hawaii?
- What? Right now?

176
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,638
Yeah! When's the last time
we did something impulsive?

177
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,921
Well, you did run for governor
without giving it much...

178
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,602
I just think we could use a vacation.
Things have been so crazy this last year.

179
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,438
Before we start the rest of our lives,
haven't we earned a break?

180
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,067
All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They got
that bridge that's just sitting there.

181
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,112
- We might as well use it.
- All right! Hawaii, here we come!

182
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,782
- All right! Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

183
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,368
- [horns honking]
- [Diane] Oh.

184
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,870
- [Mr. Peanutbutter sighs]
- [gulls squawking]

185
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,916
So, listen.

186
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,752
As you know, one of the differences
between agents and managers...

187
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,713
- Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.
- I'm producing a new TV show.

188
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,551
It's a phenomenal script which may
or may not involve ghost or newts.

189
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,011
- Does it involve ghost or newts?
- It may!

190
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,931
- You haven't read it, have you?
- Read it? I'm producing it!

191
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,436
- Right.
- It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery...

192
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,855
- Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.
- Right, well...

193
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,440
They're impossible to figure out.

194
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,818
Then all of a sudden, some random detail
makes the hero remember a conversation

195
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,405
that totally re-contextualizes everything,
and then it all magically comes together.

196
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,073
- Sure, but...
- It's such bullshit.

197
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:36,071
Where's my random detail that's gonna
suddenly make everything make sense?

198
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,155
Because I would love that.

199
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,914
Well, this script is really special,
and everyone wants to play the lead,

200
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,167
from Matthew McConaughey
to Matthew Perry.

201
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,294
- Matthew Perry?
- Yeah. But I was thinking...

202
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,504
Hold on. Matthew Perry...

203
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,177
Hey, BoJack, which one
of these pictures more says,

204
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,223
"This daughter looks like a cool lady
that I wanna have in my life"?

205
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,224
Why do you ask?

206
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,186
I'm writing a letter to my mom
and I want to include a picture.

207
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,229
I'm going to send it
to the adoption agency.

208
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,232
Maybe if they still have her address
on file, they can forward it to her.

209
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,527
Seems like a long shot. How about
a better strategy is, don't do that,

210
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,988
and then you won't be disappointed
when it doesn't work out?

211
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,324
I'm trying everything.
I don't wanna look back at this

212
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,618
and feel like the end
of "Chandler's List," you know?

213
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,661
- You mean Schindler's List.
- Never saw it.

214
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,185
I'm talking about "Chandler's List,"

215
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,540
the sketch from when Matthew Perry
hosted SNL.

216
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,833
- Remind me?
- Okay.

217
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,157
So it's Chandler from Friends,

218
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,378
and it's World War II,
and he's got this list.

219
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,297
And the whole time, he's like,
"I'm Chandler!

220
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,924
Could I have a bigger list?"

221
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,384
But then at the end, the war's over,
and he's like...

222
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,887
- "Could I have had a bigger list?"
- Whoa.

223
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,640
He's haunted because he feels
like he could have done more.

224
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,891
You know, he's like,

225
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,602
"Could I be any more feeling
like I could have done more?"

226
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,356
I have to go.

227
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,526
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!
[groans]

228
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,612
[door slams]

229
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,072
[panting]

230
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh. [gasps]

231
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,161
Huh.

232
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,503
Huh?

233
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,049
- [snarling]
- [music playing]

234
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,100
Shh!

235
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,646
Yes. Get the magazine.

236
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,649
What a fine addition
to your waiting room.

237
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,485
- Oh, no!
- [drill whirrs]

238
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,404
[music playing at faster tempo]

239
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,157
- [screaming]
- [drill whirring]

240
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,118
[grunting, groaning]

241
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,248
- Oh, God.
- [clown growling]

242
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,708
What are we gonna do, Todd?

243
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,631
- Guys, let's talk this out.
- [drill whirring]

244
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,919
[horn honking]

245
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,804
Run. Ouchie! Ouchie!

246
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,141
[both panting]

247
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,435
- Oh, man.
- I've never run that fast in my life.

248
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,353
- Me neither.
- I gotta get in better shape.

249
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,773
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,
but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

250
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,191
Hmm.

251
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,402
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.

252
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,075
- [horns honking]
- [tires screeching]

253
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,537
- Can you not start and stop so much?
- I can't control the traffic, darling.

254
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,207
When the car in front of me starts,
I start. And when it stops, I stop.

255
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,169
Maybe you don't have to start
every time the car in front of you starts,

256
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,129
because you know it's gonna
stop again anyway.

257
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,882
- You could leave a little space.
- Okay.

258
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,885
- [engine rumbles]
- And another car just cut in front of me

259
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,012
because I left a little space.

260
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,097
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

261
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,375
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.

262
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,441
All right. I got the lowdown.

263
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,027
First of all, very important,
I got you this flattened penny.

264
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,071
I will cherish it always.

265
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,282
- I'm sorry for being annoying before.
- Don't worry about it.

266
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,408
Here's the deal.

267
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,827
With this traffic,
we can stay on our current trajectory

268
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,914
and get to Hawaii just in time
to spend two luxurious hours

269
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,458
at the Honolulu Stilton,
and then turn around and come back,

270
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,127
or we can hang out here
at the Thrifty Lodge

271
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,880
at this charming halfway to Hawaii
rest area and gas park.

272
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,843
Excuse me,
we would like your finest room, please.

273
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,639
- All our rooms are the same.
- What kind of cuisine is on premises?

274
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,058
There's a deli at the gas station
across the street.

275
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,685
- And what are your spa hours?
- There's no spa.

276
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,889
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,
could I use your grand ballroom for that,

277
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,565
or is that booked months in advance?

278
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,609
I could settle for a demi-ballroom
in a pinch,

279
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,028
but attire will be formal,
I don't wanna upstage the venue.

280
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,364
We have zero ballrooms
in this Thrifty Lodge.

281
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,157
I see. This will do nicely.

282
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,537
Didn't you tell me once
you always wanted a ballroom?

283
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,873
Actually, no. [chuckles]
What I wanted was a Belle-room.

284
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,209
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

285
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,421
It's a room full of big books,
with big windows and a ladder,

286
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,256
like Belle got in Beauty and the Beast.

287
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,259
- And it's called a Belle-room?
- It's called a library.

288
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,137
But I called it a Belle-room
because it was magical.

289
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,660
And since it was a name I made up
for a room that wasn't real,

290
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,266
that meant that it was just mine.

291
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,976
That's adora-Belle.

292
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,186
- [woman] Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!
- What's that?

293
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,272
You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right?

294
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,606
Ha! That's right.

295
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,442
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

296
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,485
That's like a shellfish version
of a selfie.

297
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,071
- Hmm?
- Go, take a picture.

298
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,239
It'll make their day.

299
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,236
- You sure? You don't mind?
- I'll be in the room.

300
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,083
Don't stay out
with your new friends too late.

301
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,996
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.
What other of my things do you like?

302
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,914
[man] Wow, yeah!

303
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,207
Okay, so...

304
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,349
[snoring]

305
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,167
Oh.

306
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,691
Hey.

307
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,992
[Jose] So the supplier said,
"I really oughta give Iowa a try."

308
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,078
But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City's
about as far as I can go."

309
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,456
Long story short,
we're meeting in St. Louis.

310
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,583
- [pounding on door]
- Huh?

311
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,079
- Hey!
- I need to talk to Hollyhock!

312
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,914
- She's not here.
- You have to let me see her.

313
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,214
Please, I flew all the way here
and it's Wichita,

314
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,217
so it's not like
I got other shit to do in Wichita.

315
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,885
No one told you to come here.

316
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,845
You're the one
who likes foreign movies, right?

317
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,264
That part in Amelie,
where she listens to the guy's story?

318
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,475
This is that part.
And I'm the guy with the story.

319
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,560
And I need you to be Amelie right now.

320
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,231
I don't like foreign movies.
I like foreign films.

321
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,649
Okay, you're impossible.

322
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,734
The rest of you, please,
just listen for a second.

323
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,072
I know you hate me.
But for Hollyhock, please, listen.

324
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,281
[clears throat]

325
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,845
Whole time she's staying with me,
it doesn't make sense, right?

326
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,577
If I'm her father,
where is her mother?

327
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,663
Well, that's an extremely
heteronormative way

328
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,743
- of looking at things.
- No, I'm saying, medically,

329
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,668
where is the woman I had sex with
that made her be born?

330
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,128
Right? That's why Hollyhock
came to L.A. in the first place.

331
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,380
Okay...

332
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,174
But then I thought,
"What if I'm not her father?"

333
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,968
You're not her father.
We are her fathers.

334
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,672
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

335
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,847
Eight of you, each have
your own cute thing, I get it.

336
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,140
My point is, Hollyhock and I
have the same DNA,

337
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,393
but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

338
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,854
You're not.
Because being a father isn't just...

339
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,147
God, I feel like you are
willfully misunderstanding me.

340
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,484
What I am saying is,
I'm not even her father biologically.

341
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,862
- Excuse me?
- My father is her father.

342
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,196
- What?
- Huh?

343
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,561
[BoJack] I went to every hospital
and clerk house in L.A.

344
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,743
I waited in lines, filled out forms,
talked to anyone who would talk to me.

345
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,413
I wouldn't rest until I knew
I'd done everything I could.

346
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,707
But there was no record
of a little horse girl

347
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,292
born on Hollyhock's birthday...

348
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,459
Okay, so?

349
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,212
In L.A., because Hollyhock
wasn't born in L.A.

350
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,047
She was born in San Francisco.

351
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,967
I got a little bug in my brain
that my father knocked up the help.

352
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,928
So I went up there, and I did
the whole thing again, and I found it.

353
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,847
The birth certificate
with her mother's name,

354
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,725
clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.

355
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,518
- That's...
- But where is she now, right?

356
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,562
Looked her up on Facebook.
I know what you think:

357
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,522
"BoJack Horseman
has a Facebook account?"

358
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,066
Obviously, I didn't,
because the Internet is for nerds.

359
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,612
But I know it's a good way to find people,
so I set up an account, and I found her.

360
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,780
She lives in Minneapolis.
She's a nurse.

361
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,574
Her phone number
was on her Facebook page.

362
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,910
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.

363
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,745
- You did all that?
- She has to know.

364
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,701
You don't have to tell her I was here.
I'll stay out of her life forever.

365
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,292
You can tell her I'm an asshole.
Say you found this on your own.

366
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,462
I don't care, but you have
to tell her. Please.

367
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,758
Whittagut dittagoo yittagoo

369
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,888

371
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,395
- All right, BoJack. We'll tell her.
- Yeah?

372
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,106
Yeah. But you need to leave.
Right now.

373
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,275
[sighs] Okay.

374
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,032
Welcome to the best
workout routine in L.A.

375
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,034
Nothing motivates like fear.

376
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,162
So remember, once you're in there,
don't stop running.

377
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,706
If the clown dentists catch you,
they will bite you,

378
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,541
and they have very healthy teeth.

379
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,877
[chuckles] Okay, but not really, right?

380
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:10,840
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,
and they do actually have rabies.

381
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,968
Wow, guess I'm gonna
really have to run.

382
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,011
No more excuses. This is great.

383
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,431
Exactly! And don't forget...
have fun in there!

384
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,094
- [woman] Whoo-hoo!
- [man] Let's do this.

385
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,227
- [man 2] Let's go.
- [all screaming]

386
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,024
Well, you did it.
You made a better business.

387
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,359
We did it.

388
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,778
Between your no-nonsense approach

389
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,322
and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense
approach,

390
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,991
we make a pretty good team.

391
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,118
Yes. I'm going back to my job.

392
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,161
But if anything happens here
and you need me,

393
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,706
or if you just wanna hang out again,

394
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,958
grab a drink,
you should call me sometime.

395
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,212
Oh, um, I should tell you,
I'm actually asexual.

396
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,841
Yeah, I know. So am I.
That's why I'm asking you out.

397
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,428
- Oh! Uh, okay.
- Okay. Goodbye.

398
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,682
Huh.

399
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,482
[doorbell chimes, whinnies]

400
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,362
- I have to talk to you.
- Make yourself at home.

401
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,281
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

402
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,324
I promised you'd do this show.

403
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,327
I don't know why. I just...
I needed something...

404
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,704
- I'll do it.
- What?

405
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,915
You want me to do it, I'll do it.
God knows you've done enough for me.

406
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,377
- [groans]
- What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

407
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:33,006
It's just really hard to need people.

408
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,300
Yeah, but...

409
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,635
Yeah. Thank you.

410
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,346
Eh, it'll be good for me
to get out of the house anyway.

411
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,514
You want a drink?

412
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,850
- Water.
- Water? "Water" you pregnant?

413
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,894
[chuckles] Very much not so.

414
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,688
- I heard you got a new boyfriend.
- We broke up.

415
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,024
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

416
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,028
He was actually the first guy I ever dated
who wasn't an asshole.

417
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,907
- Well, onwards and upwards.
- I heard you had a kid living with you?

418
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,826
No. She's got these adopted dads.

419
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,496
They're total dicks,
but they take care of her.

420
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,706
- She'll have a good life.
- Oh.

421
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,459
- You ever think of adopting?
- [sighs]

422
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,754
- More and more lately.
- You should. You'd be a good mom.

423
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,924
- The world needs good moms.
- I'll take that under advisement.

424
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,052
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

425
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,970
I'm looking forward to it.

426
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,022
Now, back to normal.
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

427
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,193
- Here we are. The rest of our lives.
- I wanna show you something.

428
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,322
I had the contractor put this together
while we were gone. Close your eyes.

429
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,033
- [Diane] Okay...
- All right. Open them.

430
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,078
- Oh, my God! It's...
- Pretty cool, huh?

431
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,540
- Why would you do this?
- It's what you always wanted, right?

432
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,042
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

433
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,128
- Like what?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

434
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,839
This is great. I'm sorry.

435
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,715
Why would you think I would like this?

436
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,009
Because you told me
this is what you always dreamed of?

437
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,262
I don't like big gestures like this!

438
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,722
- How many times have I...?
- Yeah, but this is...

439
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,851
This was a fantasy,
something that belonged to me.

440
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,254
Why couldn't you have asked me...

441
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,564
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try
to surprise you, or do nice things.

442
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,816
Do you know how much it cost
to get 5,000 fake books?

443
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,236
- So I'm the bitch? Is that what you...
- I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home

444
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,321
feel like a place
that you would want to live

445
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,948
that could be yours as well as mine!

446
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,908
Why is that so important to you?

447
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,119
Because otherwise,
it feels like you're a guest.

448
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,247
And unlike the talking candlestick
in the aforementioned Disney film,

449
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,915
I don't want you to be that.

450
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,167
It makes me feel shitty.

451
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,710
Like you're just visiting here,

452
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,795
until the next thing
and you're gonna leave me

453
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,759
when you get bored
or you find something better.

454
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,838
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.

455
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:42,260
You can't use your ex-wives against me.

456
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,095
I'm just telling you how I feel.

457
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,431
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

458
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,975
This is not how I thought
this would go at all.

459
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,310
[sighs]

460
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,146
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.
Back to normal, right?

461
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,273
[chuckles]

462
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:59,068
You know, sometimes I feel like
our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

463
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,987
- I love those things.
- I know.

464
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,908
And it's messy. And at first glance,
it doesn't seem to make any sense.

465
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,577
And it's hard to figure out.

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,329
But sometimes,

467
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,415
if you squint at it just right,
everything lines up,

468
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:17,503
and it's the most perfect...
beautiful, amazing thing.

469
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,422
Yeah. I know what you mean.

470
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,382
But...

471
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,593
[voice breaks] I'm so tired of squinting.

472
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,554
[crying]

473
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,014
Oh...

474
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,444
What?

475
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,072
- Oh, Christ.
- [ringtone chiming]

476
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,576
- Hollyhock.
- Hi.

477
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,078
- How are you?
- Listen...

478
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,372
I wanted to thank you
for finding my mom.

479
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,082
- They told you?
- Not exactly.

480
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,876
They have this secret dad language
they think I don't understand,

481
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,087
but it's super obvious
what they're saying.

482
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,340
[chuckles] You're too smart
for your own good.

483
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:06,177
So, yeah, I've been talking
to Henrietta on the phone

484
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,137
and she seems really nice.

485
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,263
Really? Wow!

486
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,642
I'm gonna visit her in Minneapolis.
I'm at the airport right now.

487
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,227
Right now? That's incredible.

488
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,938
No, what's incredible
is this place at the airport

489
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,357
charged me ten dollars
for a cup of fruit.

490
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,817
- What?
- And get this.

491
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,944
It's like 90 percent honeydew.

492
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,570
Are you kidding me? Why?

493
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,075
What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding
more honeydew in his or her fruit cup?

494
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,077
Nobody ever wants honeydew,
it's always there.

495
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,579
It is literally the worst part
of everything it's in.

496
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,581
It's like the Jared Leto of fruits.

497
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,958
Thank you. Exactly.

498
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,041
Mmm.

499
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,503
Well...

500
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,756
Anyway,
they're about to start boarding, so...

501
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,634
Hollyhock, I'm sorry
I didn't take better care of you.

502
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,887
I shouldn't have moved in with you.
It was maybe too much too fast.

503
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,140
- Yeah.
- But it wasn't all bad.

504
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,101
I mean, yeah,
I got secretly drugged for months on end

505
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,438
to the point I was living a nightmare
in which I couldn't recognize my own body

506
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,773
or understand what was happening
to my brain, but,

507
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,609
other than that,
it was a pretty chill experience.

508
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:04,819
I should have protected you.

509
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,904
I really wanted to be
a good dad to you, Hollyhock.

510
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,490
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

511
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,492
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.

512
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,786
Yeah. Good thing.

513
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:19,584
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh?
Did you rent a car or a cab?

514
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,253
BoJack, it's all taken care of.
I gotta go.

515
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,838
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

516
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,340
I can upgrade your seats, or...
or send you better fruit.

517
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,802
BoJack, look,
I never needed you to be a dad.

518
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,137
I'm going to be fine.

519
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,639
I told you from the beginning,
I have eight dads.

520
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,976
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

521
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:40,897
But... I've never had a brother.
