00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,929
[crowd cheering]

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,348
Thank you, Billy Crystal,
for that impression of a black person.

3
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,727
-I'm Scott Wolf.
-And I'm Matthew Fox.

4
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,854
We may be a group of five on TV,

5
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,607
but any of these next nominees
would be welcome

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,734
to join our party any day.

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,444
-[microphone feedback]
-[man coughs]

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:31,282
The nominees for Male Animal in
a Comedy, Drama or Variety Show are:

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,201
BoJack Horseman,
Horsin' Around.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
Now that's what I call
horsin' around.

11
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,706
[audience laughs and applauds]

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,916
Uh... Yeah.

13
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,377
Mr. Peanutbutter,
Mr. Peanutbutter's House.

14
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,714
Now that's what I call
doggin' around.

15
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,132
[audience laughs and applauds]

16
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,467
[laughs]

17
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,803
And finally, my personal favorite,

18
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:55,389
Hank Hippopopalous,
Hank After Dark!

19
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,726
Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,019
-[baby shrieks]
-[audience laughs and applauds]

21
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,229
Hiya!

22
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,607
And the animals' choice is...

23
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,026
Hank Hippopopalous,
Hank After Dark!

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,944
[Wolf howls]

25
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:08,861
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,822
[camera shutters clicking]

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,324
No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,118
called Party of Five. Get it?

29
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,203
Hey, buddy,
pass me that bottle of vodka?

30
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,373
-That's not really how this works.
-It's open bar, don't be a dick.

31
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,751
-BoJack Horseman?
-Do I know you?

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,795
This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.

33
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,714
-Katrina, BoJack.
-I don't watch TV.

34
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:32,010
Can I get another drink now or
will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

35
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,764
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--
-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

36
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,683
My friends told me to get
a prenup,

37
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,144
but I was like,
"Hey, marriage lasts forever."

38
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,980
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

39
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,106
Can you believe two guys like us

40
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,819
were even in the same category
as Hank Hippopopalous?

41
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,236
[chuckles] That's Uncle Hanky.

42
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,198
Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."

43
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,908
I'm BoJack Horseman.

44
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,536
You're just some other guy
I'll probably never talk to again.

45
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:02,206
Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode?

46
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,165
[all laugh]

47
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,085
That is the funniest thing
I have ever heard.

48
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,296
Uncle Hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.

49
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,299
I used to watch Hank Hippopopalous's
Dance-Pop Cosmopolis

50
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,801
every day after school.

51
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,888
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?
-Of course, kid.

52
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,559
Here, let me advance this. [grunts]
And we probably got it.

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,310
And we'll find out
in four to six weeks.

54
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,645
Yeah, I can't wait.

55
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,939
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,357
into that busboy's pants.

57
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,694
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

58
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,029
Hey, kid, listen.

59
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,697
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

60
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,658
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

61
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,369
-Yeah?
-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

62
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,121
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

63
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,207
That's just the way it is.

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,959
Oh.

65
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,461
This suit needs more flasks.

66
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,884
[♪♪]

67
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,109
-Diane!
-[passenger] Aah!

68
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,404
Will you bring me one of those
big Toblerone bars? [chuckles]

69
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,866
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.

70
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,578
Yes, I know, but I always forget to
write these things down.

71
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,538
Tell me, how's your little movie?

72
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,834
Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.

73
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,377
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

74
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,047
Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.
Meanwhile, Diane,

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,509
here in Cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.

76
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,385
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

77
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,015
Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

78
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,100
Well, now the production's
on hiatus

79
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,019
so BoJack and I
are going on a book tour

80
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,980
to promote the new paperback edition
of One Trick Pony.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,523
Please get here soon, Diane.

82
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:38,320
The people of Cordovia need you
and I need that Toblerone.

83
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,072
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,700
You need to be on
your best behavior for this tour.

85
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,327
Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script

86
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,163
and get a lot of people
mad at you.

87
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,040
What? I don't do that.

88
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,208
You're a movie star now.

89
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,711
Any bad press you get
can hurt Secretariat.

90
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,839
Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.

91
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,799
Please. We're going to Alaska.

92
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,760
How am I gonna offend a bunch
of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

93
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,263
You're right. What was I thinking?

94
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,515
The Republic of Cordovia's
Prince Gustav

95
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,226
visiting Los Angeles this week

96
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,395
while his country
rests on the brink of civil war.

97
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,397
Prince Gustav
is a ruthless despot,

98
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,441
but I'd still rather share a bed
with him than my ex-wife.

99
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,777
Shannon, I didn't mean that.

100
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,033
[dance music playing over speakers]

101
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,451
Listen. With Hey, I Think You
Can Dance as a lead-in,

102
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,163
we are expecting big things
for Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:

103
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,707
What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?
Let's Find Out,

104
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,670
or H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.
for short.

105
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,422
-Mm.
-[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

106
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,299
You guys can get
some pictures together.

107
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,926
Hank is coming here?

108
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,303
That old guy from
Hey, I Think You Can Dance?

109
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,847
-What's the big deal?
-You don't understand.

110
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,017
When I was a kid,
this guy was the guy.

111
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:53,771
I even bought his novelty rap album,
The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.

112
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,981
You shouldn't meet your hero
on an empty stomach.

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,983
-Want me to go get you some chili?
-Good call.

114
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,651
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

115
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,321
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

116
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,407
-Hank Hippopopalous.
-Oh, we've met.

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,953
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

118
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,662
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

119
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,331
you guys could stand back to back.

120
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,333
And then on the billboard it'll say:

121
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,546
"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back
to back. Thursdays on MBN." [laughs]

122
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,258
So, what should I do with my arms?
Like akimbo?

123
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,508
-You're fine.
-Reverse akimbo?

124
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,803
-No, that--
-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

125
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,846
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.

126
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,681
-Can't stop windmilling now.
-Hey, hey.

127
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,392
Why don't we just do
what feels natural?

128
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,394
Guys like us? We're pros.

129
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,729
"Guys like us"?

130
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,522
You think I'm a guy like us?

131
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,942
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

132
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,777
Excuse me,
would you get a picture of us?

133
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,238
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

134
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,867
Now we open the floor to questions
from the audience.

135
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,622
BoJack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.

136
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,333
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

137
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,625
So, my question is:

138
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,086
Do you think Israel
has a right to defend herself?

139
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,921
-Uh...
-And what part should the U.S. play

140
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:01,839
as an ally?

141
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,382
[groans]

142
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,509
Well, the thing about that...

143
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,469
[both growl]

144
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,098
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.

145
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,809
I mean, obviously there's no panacea,
but a two-state solution

146
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,854
with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

147
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,813
[audience murmuring]

148
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,524
-[Moose] Brilliant insight.
-[woman] Very good.

149
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,818
-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu--
-Oh.

150
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,903
- Nyu--
-You won't get it. Ask the question.

151
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,655
Your book went to some revealing places.

152
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,449
Were you worried at all that it
would hurt BoJack or his career?

153
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,826
That's a great question.

154
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,204
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

155
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,124
Well, I think the truth
is worth pursuing, no matter what.

156
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,501
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities

157
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,921
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.

158
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,465
-Like who?
-I don't know, like Mike Tyson

159
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:50,554
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

160
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,391
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

161
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,934
Wait, wait, what about
Hank Hippopopalous?

162
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,146
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

163
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,565
-I feel like we're getting off track.
-Do you not know that?

164
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,193
Any questions about me,
the handsome, famous horse with a book?

165
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,944
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

166
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,072
I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.

167
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,574
You can just Google
"Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--

168
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,410
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

169
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,327
[all gasp]

170
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,245
Dear God.

171
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,457
Stanky Hanky?
Allegations vile and ranky.

172
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,419
But first, the visiting
Cordovian Prince Gustav

173
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,295
went missing briefly
this afternoon,

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,798
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.

175
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,303
His official statement was,
"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

176
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,472
Hooray, being a prince."

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,641
Our main story,
ominous and anomalous accusations

178
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,394
against Hank Hippopopalous.

179
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,396
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

180
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,940
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?

181
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
Joining me now is
Hippopopalous apologist

182
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,569
and armchair sociologist,
Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

183
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,029
what are these allegations?

184
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,074
These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV

185
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,951
or I'll sound like a crazy person.

186
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,578
What I want to know
is why we're letting a national treasure

187
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,831
face the same kind of smear tactics
used by the Viet Cong.

188
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,833
Are you calling attention to the fact

189
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,462
that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

190
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,005
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

191
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,093
[Peanutbutter] You gotta see
this set they're building!

192
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,803
There's a giant replica of my head,

193
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,597
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,

194
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,850
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

195
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,103
We're bringing class
back to primetime.

196
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,647
-Sounds amazing.
-And I'm really getting along

197
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,023
with J.D. Salinger.

198
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,319
-Did you know we both hate phonies?
-I did know that.

199
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,613
So... listen.
Some website called "Tit Puncher"

200
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:35,117
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.

201
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,786
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter,
I didn't mean for that to happen.

202
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,872
Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.

203
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,001
It's really not a good time, you know,
with my show about to launch.

204
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,296
-Hey, we are on the same page.
-Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

205
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,214
Because you should not read
the comments.

206
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,049
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier

207
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,968
than for this to just go away.

208
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,096
-Great. I love you, too.
-[with heavy accent] Hello.

209
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,140
-Oh, my God!
-Is chili you ask for.

210
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,975
I am peasant boy Todd
from village.

211
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,687
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover
of federated American states.

212
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,857
No reason for suspicions.
[laughs] Come on!

213
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,235
Wait a second, something's different.
[sniffs]

214
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,030
I am... digging this new cologne!

215
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,906
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

216
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,327
Is so great to be
in meager trash city Los Angeles

217
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,079
with no pressures of royal life.

218
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,416
What? Royal life?
Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

219
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,043
[chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

220
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,421
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.

221
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,006
I'd know it anywhere.

222
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,679
-We will now begin our Q and A.
-Fire when ready.

223
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,932
What you got against Uncle Hanky,
you uppity cooze?

224
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,560
Diane,
I believe this question is for you.

225
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,644
If anyone here has any questions
about the book,

226
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,104
I'd be happy to answer those.

227
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,439
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

228
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,858
Golden-Globe winning
star of the book.

229
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,571
If Hank did anything wrong,
they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

230
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,614
I'm really not here
to talk about that.

231
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,533
You women are all the same.

232
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,284
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, you make these

233
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,370
broad accusations
to get attention for yourself,

234
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,748
and when you don't have proof
to back it up, you just slink away.

235
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,291
I'm not slinking away.

236
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,252
I just wanted to say one thing
about me.

237
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,505
I text and drive like all the time.
What?

238
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,966
Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,

239
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,677
and they don't even care
they could be ruining a man's life.

240
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,305
What? They ruined his life?

241
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,308
-You should probably just drop this.
-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

242
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,436
They don't even know
how much I'm gonna drop it.

243
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,979
The way you said that
made it sound like you won't drop it.

244
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,982
How dare you spread
a narrative that--

245
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,276
Don't tell me what to spread.

246
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,446
I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.

247
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,656
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

248
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,533
-This is completely--
-Yeah, hi.

249
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,118
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

250
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,121
I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,

251
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,706
like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor

252
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,292
that children are just better at.

253
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,043
You ever try to fit
into a mine shaft?

254
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,963
That is a tight squeeze. What?

255
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,382
Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?

256
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm so incorrigible.

257
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,553
Everyone's paying attention
to me now!

258
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,346
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

259
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,641
Anyone else want a snack?

260
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,227
No? That's a no?
On the snacks? Okay.

261
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,187
What do you have against
Hank Hippopopalous?

262
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,523
Everyone says
he's a really nice guy.

263
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,483
Good point.

264
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,652
That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,

265
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,028
people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things

266
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,405
so they let him off the hook.

267
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,533
We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said."

268
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,162
"He said, they said."
It's eight different women.

269
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,582
-Are they all lying?
-I mean, probably. We do that.

270
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,750
At this point,
we just don't know enough to judge.

271
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,378
Who are these women?
Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

272
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,630
Do they wear short shorts?

273
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,007
Do they drink alcohol?
All these things are possible.

274
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,676
We don't know the facts.

275
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,302
See, this is part of the problem.

276
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,886
You're supposed to be a journalist.

277
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,264
You won't even tell your audience
what he's accused of.

278
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,016
You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us?

279
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,309
I'm not afraid to say it.

280
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:50,103
Eight different women,
all former assistants,

281
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,939
claim that Uncle Hanky
took them to a--

282
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,358
What is Diane doing?

283
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,444
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour
and she's upstaging me.

284
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,154
Like how it was supposed
to be my book.

285
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,031
Actually, this might be
a thing she does.

286
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,074
She knows that Hippopopalous
is the only thing

287
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,868
keeping my network afloat, right?

288
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,120
The same network
that employs her husband.

289
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,664
Why would she do this?

290
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,666
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy

291
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,544
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!

292
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,588
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,

293
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,465
it can bring along
its dumb friend honeydew?

294
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,509
You don't get a plus-one,
cantaloupe!

295
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:21,885
You need to talk to her.

296
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,845
Huh.

297
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,516
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit
on Contemporary Family.

298
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,684
It's a disaster!

299
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,561
-What?
-The kids have gone through puberty.

300
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,896
They are rubbing themselves
on everything.

301
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,691
If it isn't one thing, it's ano--
Just get a hose!

302
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:45,283
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail
for you like real American Johnny.

303
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,285
-Hey, man.
-Whoa!

304
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,163
You know it's a federal crime to go
through someone else's mail?

305
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:55,877
I do not know your customs,
for I am dirt-poor servant child.

306
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,714
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.

307
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,300
Death threat for wife, death threat
for wife, once more death threat,

308
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,887
and here many monies off
for Bed Bath Beyond.

309
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,182
Seems like great U.S.A. dream castle!

310
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,059
Good Lord, that's graphic.

311
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,977
How would she even fit
one of those in there?

312
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,814
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.

313
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:21,278
Excuse, Dog Dog Peanut Man?
This wife, she poke bear, yes?

314
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,447
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

315
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,117
They have a saying where I am from,
which is here.

316
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,119
Bear not like to be poke.

317
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,622
-Bear get angry...
-Right.

318
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,625
and destroy peasant rebel army

319
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,504
with fist of fire of which make
many, many nightmares

320
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,632
to children and men!

321
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,385
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.

322
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,345
Please don't ever change.

323
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,639
[inaudible dialogue]

324
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,598
[women gasp]

325
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,892
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with-- Oh, I don't know.

326
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,519
What's Gwyneth doing for Purim?

327
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,563
Diane? I want you
to meet Amanda Hannity,

328
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,565
editor-in-chief
here at Manatee Fair.

329
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,776
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.

330
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,112
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

331
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,657
but damn if she doesn't
get shit done.

332
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,908
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

333
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,370
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.

334
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,372
I would love
to take down Hippopopalous

335
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,501
and finally topple the acropolis
of monstrous hypocrisy

336
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,543
that ensconces us.

337
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,546
Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?

338
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,924
Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.

339
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,387
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing
your weight behind this.

340
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,348
-Oh, I didn't mean--
-That dress is hideous.

341
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,057
Go home, burn it and come back.

342
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,310
When we know what we know
about a monster like that

343
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,978
and we still put him on TV
every week,

344
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,147
we're teaching a generation
of young boys and girls

345
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,024
that a man's reputation
is more important

346
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,026
than the lives of the women
he's ruined.

347
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,820
Yes, exactly!
I feel like I've been alone

348
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,823
in a crazy alternate universe
these last few days.

349
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,533
Well, you know I got your back,
right?

350
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,536
We women have got to stick to--
Hey, fruit plate.

351
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,539
No, people don't want articles
about that. People want life-hacks.

352
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,624
Diane, you need to be strong.

353
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,211
Everyone is gunning for you. You're
a woman talking out of turn about a man.

354
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,840
We're not supposed to have opinions.
We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

355
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,967
No, this model doesn't look as pretty
as the other one. Can we kill it?

356
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,679
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

357
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,891
We need to sit you down with someone
who's willing to go on the record.

358
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,935
I already reached out to all eight
of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

359
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,354
-What about his current assistant?
-You think she'd talk?

360
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,606
I don't know. What do you think,

362
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:27,111
Hi, my name's Nicole.
I work for Mr. Hippopopalous and, um...

363
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,239
I really need to talk to someone.

364

[gasps]

365
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,536
Are you kidding me?
With this honeydew right now? Ugh!

366
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,548
-Nicole?
-Mm-hm.

[car door opens]

368
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,094
[Hank] Hello, Diane.

369
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,347
Thank you, Nicole.

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,106
Prince Gustav today startled
the international community

371
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,025
when he gave his royal fortune
to charity.

372
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,819
What? Oh, no!

373
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,864
And fired his chief advisor,
who can be seen in this file photo

374
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,574
looking vaguely suspicious.

375
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,825
Oh, you idiot! No!

376
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
Big reforms which could
lead to sweeping change

377
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,081
in the embattled region,
or a precipitous economic collapse.

[shouting in Cordovian]

379
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,797
But back to our main story,
what is Diane's problem?

380
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,509
I'll say it once, for your article.

381
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:36,974
I didn't do any of those things
that you're accusing me of.

382
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,142
I wanna be very clear.

383
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,728
I'm not meeting you here
because I'm scared of you.

384
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,354
This is me doing you a favor.

385
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,065
-I think you are scared of me.
-I'm not a bad guy, Diane,

386
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,734
and I truly do believe that.

387
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,444
Twenty-four hours from now,

388
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,447
the news cycle
will move on to something else.

389
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,240
I'll go back to hosting my dance show,

390
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,619
which employs hundreds
of nice, good, hardworking people.

391
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:01,122
You, on the other hand,
are pretty much done.

392
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,125
People love me and they're
not gonna forgive you for this.

393
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,419
-This isn't about me.
-If you keep pushing this,

394
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,213
you're gonna drag down
the people close to you.

395
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,008
Look, you had your fun.

396
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,302
So, why don't you call it a day
and go home to your husband?

397
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,553
I know who you are.

398
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,348
Sweetheart, everyone knows who I am.

399
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,976
I'm Hank Hippopopalous.

400
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,352
Who the hell are you?

401
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,779
-So, you got nothing.
-I'm not giving up.

402
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,405
There's gotta be someone
who will talk.

403
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,450
Oh, listen. I had a conversation
with my bosses

404
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,537

Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-

-Are you seriously killing this?
-It's just not a good time.

408

with the fact

Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?

It's just like an Oreo,

No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

416

Because you're mad at me, right?

417

Not because Joe-Joes
taste like garbage?

We don't torture people

You eat your cheesy pizza,
you drink your ade of gator.

-Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

Hank's innocent, do you?

have been perpetrated in my name.

No, most of the news has been about
Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

Everything I did
was to help you tell the story

I knew you wanted to tell.

476
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,136
You got everything you wanted
because of that book.

now people take you seriously.

You were out of work,
now you got your dream role.

479

Okay, yes. All of that is true.

480
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,564
But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.

481
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,692
And it's weird that
you never apologized for that...

482
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,776
and that you still won't.

483
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:03,114

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

-Are you?
-Yes, actually. I am.

I didn't want to do that

486
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,998
and I probably could have
handled things better.

asked me if it was "a go"

...on "that thing we talked about"?

497
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,280
And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.

498
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,157
Now I'm not sure
that was the right answer.

499
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,327
So, then I called Wayne to see

500
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,746
if I could write a story for Buzzfeed.
Here's the good news:

501
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,039
They'll publish anything.

502
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,041
Hey, um...

503
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,251
Can I talk to you?

504
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,794
Yeah, of course. What's up?

505
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,382
I asked you, really nicely,
not to make a big thing out of this.

506
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,762
-Yeah, I know, but someone--
-Had to say something, right?

507
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,431
And that someone had to be you?

508
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,600
Because... why?

509
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,435
I really don't get it.

510
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,189
What is accomplished by you
being the one to take a stand on this?

511
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,732
-Uh...
-[sighs]

512
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,817
Mr. Peanutbutter--

513
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,945
This game show
is a really big deal for me.

514
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,406
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.

515
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,244
But I need this to go well,
and I can't... [sighs]

516
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,703
Those are death threats.

517
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,789
People want to murder my wife

518
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,582
because of what she's
saying on the news

519
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,669
about something that
she has nothing to do with.

520
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,421
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

521
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,674
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
-Oh.

522
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,470
God, you know, you'd almost
be safer in Cordovia.

523
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,597
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

524
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,391
I'm obviously not making
a difference here.

525
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,810
Actually, maybe you should.

526
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,063
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.

527
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:04,235
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

528
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,156
You don't really want me to go,
do you?

529
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,575
Why does it suddenly matter
what I want?

530
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,711
[man over PA] Flight 57,
Cordovian Airlines, now boarding.

531
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,839
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it?

532
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,007
No, I did not.

533
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,718
Well, that's good enough for me.

534
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:33,472
Coming up, Kanye West claims to hate
Thin Mints. Our panel is outraged.

535
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,267
Hating Thin Mints?
Is he legally insane?

536
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,853
You can bet we'll get into this
further in the next hour.

537
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,023
This is the only thing
I care about now.

538
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,567
[man] Hey.

539
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,320
Smile.

540
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,489
