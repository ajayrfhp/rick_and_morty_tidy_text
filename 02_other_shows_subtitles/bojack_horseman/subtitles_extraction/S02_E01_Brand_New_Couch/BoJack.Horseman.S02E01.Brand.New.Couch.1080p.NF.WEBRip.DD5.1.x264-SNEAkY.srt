00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,480
to be working with you.
[chuckles] Yeah.

165
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,901
Hey, man, that's
fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

166
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,570
- Hi. Kelsey Jannings?
- That depends.

167
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,989
- Are you my ex-wife's lawyer?
- I'm Diane.

168
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm here to be a character consultant.

169
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,619
- What?
- I got a call from the studio.

170
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,873
Okay. Why don't you stand over there and
make sure no one trips over that cable?

171
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,418
- This cable?
- Do you have a thousand dollars?

172
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,044
- What?
- Because each minute

173
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,089
I spend talking to you,
that's how much money I'm wasting.

174
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,757
- Oh. Sorry.
- Hey, who's this guy?

175
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,342
- Who let this guy in?
- I just--

176
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,386
He's got a funny face. I like your face.

177
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,430
- Thank you.
- What a cute funny face. Cookie?

178
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,223
Can someone get this guy a cookie?

179
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,600
He's got a soothing face
and I like looking at it.

180
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,560
- Like a Matisse painting.
- Whoa.

181
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,813
Guys, could I get
everyone's attention, please?

182
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,565
Oh, watch out for the cable.
Don't trip over the cable.

183
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,568
I just want everyone to know
what an honor it is to be here.

184
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,780
Secretariat has always been
a personal hero of mine.

185
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,950
A complex role that requires
a precise touch and a deft hand

186
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,828
and I just can't wait to tackle it
head-on.

187
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,538
It's truly an honor.

188
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,373
Namaste.

189
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,837
Neat. So, in this scene,
Secretariat's at his lowest.

190
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,215
He just lost his first race,
his father was sent to the glue factory.

191
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,842
It's a dark moment.

192
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:56,263
- You got it.
- Scene 22 alpha, take one.

193
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,848
[inhales, then exhales]

194
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,725
- [Kelsey] Action!
- Hey, Secretariat.

195
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,983
[campy] What are you doing here?

196
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,610
[chuckles]

197
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,531
[mumbles, then chuckles]

198
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,532
[Kelsey groans]

199
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,824
[phone buzzing]

200
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,744
- Hello?
- Diane!

201
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,997
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

202
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,125
you're not here with me
in Northern Cordovia.

203
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,336
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

204
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,963
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

205
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,923
I'm amazing.

206
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,343
Sebastian,
I know you're doing important work.

207
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,221
I couldn't just drop everything
and fly to the Third World.

208
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,473
- I just got married, and--
- [Sebastian] Diane.

209
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,641
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

210
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,936
And I need people
to witness me witnessing it.

211
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,107
I know, and I'll be there in three months,
as soon as I'm done on the movie.

212
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,359
This is also important.

213
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,777
In a way.

214
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,906
Well, lucky for you,
there'll still be just as much famine

215
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,909
and war and devastation
in three months.

216
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,327
I'm not dead yet.

217
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,872
- Yep. Lucky me.
- [man] We're still rolling, people.

218
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,167
So, BoJack, in this scene,
Secretariat is sad, right?

219
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,086
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

220
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,880
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.
[chuckles]

221
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,049
Okay, here we go. Action.

222
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,342
Hey, Secretariat.

223
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,636
[campy] What are you doing here?

224
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,806
That was bad. I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.

225
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,808
- I'll say when to keep rolling.
- Okay.

226
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,938
What are you doing here? Did we get it?
I can tell by your face that we didn't.

227
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,441
All right, let me try again.
What are you doing--?

228
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,403
I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

229
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,156
When did you get here?
Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,075
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

231
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,578
Can we kill these lights at all?
Is that a--?

232
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,246
- No.
- Okay, I'm sad.

233
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,039
I'm sad. Acting sad.

234
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,250
Secretariat is sad.

235
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,501
Okay, here we go.

236
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,211
I'm sad!

237
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,504
Sorry, what was the line?

238
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,634
I don't know if this helps or not,
but when Secretariat was a kid

239
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,343
- he actually--
- Aah!

240
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,844
- My face!
- [man 1] Hey, hey.

241
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,639
- Whoa, whoa!
- [man 2] Oh, my God.

242
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,014
[man 3] Watch out!
[man 4] Hey.

243
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,058
[man 5 gasps]
[man 6] Whoa, whoa!

244
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,686
[PA] Oh, my God. My face.

245
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,438
My beautiful face.

246
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,566
Why didn't someone tell me
not to trip over that cable?

247
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,903
It was such an important job,
but no one was there to do it

248
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,823
and now my face is in ruins.

249
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,534
We're gonna need a couple of days
to rebuild this set.

250
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,787
So, let's all just use this time
to regroup

251
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,583
and really figure out what we're doing

252
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,002
and why we're here.

253
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,338
[audience laughing]

254
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,136
So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good?

255
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,973
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk
to me. Jeezy Kableezy.

256
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,017
[audience laughing]

257
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,314
Well, it wasn't Ibsen.

258
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,276
That's your takeaway?
That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?

259
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,778
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

260
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,449
Oh, I loved the part where you got
your head caught in the banister.

261
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,493
- Yeah--
- And what's this letter I have?

262
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,579
It's from the government saying,
"I'm proud of you."

263
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,666
- Are you--?
- No, what I'm holding is nothing.

264
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,377
Can you check on our drinks?
I would love some gin.

265
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,130
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open
container. This town is full of AIDS.

266
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,466
- That's not--
- You're a clown, you know that?

267
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,510
You've always been a pillar of support.

268
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,220
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

269
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,889
I'm here, aren't I?
I suffered through that ordeal.

270
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,684
You know, the man sitting next to me
was wearing a T-shirt?

271
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,478
A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.

272
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,688
Yes, a T-shirt.

273
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,440
Worst thing that's happened to anyone
in a theater.

274
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,694
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."
- Here we go.

275
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,196
I don't know to what "it"
the T-shirt referred

276
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,282
but I won't be spoken to in that tone
by an article of clothing.

277
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,618
Vodka? Triple sec?
Looking for any alcohol.

278
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,495
You don't know how lucky you are.

279
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:52,374
I hope you die before I do so you never
know what it's like to lose a mother.

280
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,585
As long as one of us dies,
that's good enough.

281
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:59,297
Can we please get some alcohol
into my mouth?

282
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,675
[man on recording]
The past is past.

283
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,219
That's why it's called the past.

284
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,722
Tomorrow is an opportunity.

285
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,559
You can be big and proud
and bang on your tom-tom drum

286
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,020
or you can get in your boat and row.

287
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,231
Tom or row.

288
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,775
Tomorrow.

289
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,694
- Hey, do you wanna talk?
- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

290
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,655
So you can put everything
in a book and sell a million copies?

291
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,031
Wow. Uh...

292
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,992
That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

293
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:28,910
[phone rings]

294
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,746
- No.
- I gotta say,

295
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,164
the new you seems a little on edge.

296
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,875
What? Me?
I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.

297
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,502
That's a metaphor, Diane.

298
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,003
- It's a simile.
- Goddamn it.

299
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:39,921
[phone rings]

300
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,757
Oh, okay. Hello?

301
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,468
Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it?

302
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,012
- I heard you're blowing it.
- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

303
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,724
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.
If you don't--

304
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,560
Hey, can you hold on a second?
I'm getting another call.

305
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:58,898
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,
the boy prince of the 26th floor.

306
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,778
Carolyn.
How are things all the way up on 27?

307
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,947
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

308
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,908
Killing...

309
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,327
Give me some gossip.

310
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,871
My wife is making me go
to the opera tonight.

311
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,707
I need something to distract me
from the thought of D-bags

312
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,084
singing songs in German
about their boners.

313
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,295
Okay, you gotta
keep this close to the vest

314
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,381
but I am inches
from getting Emily VanCamp

315
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:27,385
the lead in Goose Van Sant's
new movie about Jackie O.

316
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:32,516
My clients would f-l-ip
if I got them parts like that.

317
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,143
You're killing it
in the department of kicking ass

318
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,605
in regards to you being an agent
and being good at it, crushing it.

319
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,859
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,
for a 26er. [chuckles]

320
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,362
You're the only one in this building
who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

321
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,574
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.
I know you're listening.

322
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,369
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

323
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,245
[chuckles]

324
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,373
I don't think she's coming back.

325
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,668
Could we keep it down
in the front, please?

326
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,628
- Thank you.
- What am I gonna do?

327
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,924
Well, you were an actor for nine years
on Horsin' Around. How did you do that?

328
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,091
Uh...

329
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,220
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Of course, buddy.

330
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,223
I always have time for you,
my good friend BoJack

331
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,016
in this, the year 1988.

332
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,934
Have a seat.

333
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,018
[stomping overhead]

334
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,689
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

335
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,943
- Am I-- Am I a clown?
- Oh, brother.

336
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,654
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom
to the taping?

337
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,242
As Max Headroom would say,
"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." [chuckles]

338
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,285
But I am a good actor, right?

339
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:38,331
BJ, I don't know. Look--
You know what you're good at?

340
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,293
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,
loudly with good diction.

341
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,838
Should I be doing more?
To capture the character

342
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,132
- and make the audience connect?
- This is a situation comedy.

343
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,387
No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.

344
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,681
You bring joy to millions of people.

345
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,852
Maybe someday later,
you'll need to learn how to act for real.

346
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,564
But for now,
[chuckles] don't worry about it.

347
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,025
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

348
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,696
All this time, I assumed there was more
to me than everyone thought

349
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,197
but maybe there isn't.

350
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,618
That's the part where you're supposed
to disagree with me.

351
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,160
Oh, right.

352
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,164
Well, you got the part, didn't you?
What did you do in the audition?

353
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,292
Well, how should I know?
That was the old me.

354
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,378
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

355
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,423
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
What should I do?

356
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,341
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

357
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,219
Start a new life there?
Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

358
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,472
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

359
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,390
Work my way up until I own the place?

360
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,893
What am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.

361
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,313
Too much responsibility. What am I
gonna do? The walls are closing in!

362
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,190
BoJack, breathe. You can do this.

363
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,486
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

364
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,779
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

365
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,239
Plus, you can watch old
Secretariat videos.

366
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,867
I've got a hard drive full of research.

367
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,829
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I can do this.

368
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,330
I've got two whole days.

369
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,124
And when the pressure's on,
that's when I shine.

370
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,004
Yeah. Two days.
I can do all those things.

371
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,174
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

372
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,137
- What are you doing here?
- Ah!

373
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,097
That was it. Say that again.

374
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,475
[campy] What are you doing here?

375
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,852
- Okay.
- No?

376
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,311
BoJack, before we get started

377
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,146
- I wanted to show you this.
- What?

378
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,899
This is the machine
that's gonna make you a good actor.

379
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,819
- Really?
- No. We need to make a scan of your face

380
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,488
so that if you die,
we can finish the movie.

381
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,116
Standard procedure. When a star
is assessed to be of a certain liability,

382
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,287
like if there was a whole book written
about what a reckless jackass he is,

383
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,667
you make a digital replica so you're
not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.

384
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,252
- Wait, which Belushi?
- Hold still, please.

385
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,254
[whirring]

386
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,633
- Terrific. We got it.
- One day, that's gonna be the job.

387
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,302
Sit for five seconds
while a machine scans his face.

388
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,555
Six months later,
plugging a movie on Kimmel.

389
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,725
I gotta go on Kimmel now?
What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

390
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,267
I'm not emotionally prepared.

391
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,603
Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part

392
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,774
we'll just fire you and get someone else
who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

393
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,861
- [groans]
- What do you need, BoJack?

394
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,907
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,
but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

395
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,410
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?
- I don't make mistakes, BoJack.

396
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,914
I do the crossword in Sharpie,
I never learned the shortcut for undo.

397
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,124
- Command-Z.
- Don't need it, won't use it.

398
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,253
I'm trying to have this new attitude,
be this better, more positive guy.

399
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,631
I keep thinking about how this movie
is my last shot at happiness.

400
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,592
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:

401
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,137
I don't care if you are happy or not.

402
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,346
You have a job to do.

403
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,015
[Kelsey chuckles]

404
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:46,269
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.
I wanna put you in my pocket. [grunts]

405
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,939
- You're adorable.
- Aw.

406
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,066
[man sobbing]

407
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,484
- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?
- Yes.

408
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,613
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

409
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,949
Can you write on a sign
"watch out for cable"?

410
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,868
You were telling people,
but it's a really important job

411
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,954
and a sign is less likely
to get distracted.

412
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,124
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

413
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,833
What are you doing here?

414
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,376
What are you doing here?

415
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,462
What are you doing here?

416
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,339
- What are you doing here?
- So, I went a little overboard

417
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,216
and I made you two mixes.

418
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,052
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.

419
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,680
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'
side projects and solo singles.

420
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,642
Listen to it and imagine the band
never took that hiatus

421
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,728
in the mid-aughts
when America briefly lost interest in ska.

422
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,564
I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.

423
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,691
I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.

424
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,609
[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

425
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,528
All right. You don't wanna listen
to Bosstones together.

426
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,489
That's the impression that I get.

427
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,367
- Is it the impression that I get?
- Yes. That's the impression that you get.

428
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,577
[Todd yawns]

429
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:48,915
I see. Way to go, Mr. Peanutbutter.
What a stupid move. Why did you--?

430
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,459
[snarling]

431
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,418
[BoJack groans]

432
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:57,090
BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.

433
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,300
- You gotta be strong.
- Yeah, but--

434
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,596
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?
So what if the new couch is weird?

435
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,015
- Or lumpy?
- Uh, what?

436
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,309
What are you gonna do?
Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

437
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,730
- Are you talking to me, or you--?
- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

438
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:18,486
It's time to go home
and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!

439
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,613
Happy ending for Todd!

440
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,532
[sighs]

441
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,914
- [phone rings]
- [Charley gasps and grunts]

442
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,459
Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.

443
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:37,505
Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base
about Emily's start date on Jackie O.

444
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, yeah. Uh...

445
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,385
Well, we got some new screen tests

446
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,264
and, uh, Goose decided to go
in a different direction.

447
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,475
Are you saying the Van Sant camp
wants to recant on VanCamp?

448
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,019
Because they can't.

449
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,145
Uh...

450
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,856
Charley, you better get your client
to change his mind

451
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,526
- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--
- Just kidding.

452
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,445
- I can't get to the phone right now.
- What?

453
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:06,325
This is one of those answering machines
that sounds like it's Charley talking

454
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,912
but it's actually
just an answering machine.

455
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,289
- I know you're there, Charley.
- Leave a message.

456
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,332
- I'm not gonna leave a message.
- Beep.

457
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,752
Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.
Listen--

458
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,546
- Mailbox is full.
- What? Mailbox full?

459
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,715
- Error. Message deleted.
- Wait-- No--

460
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,925
Gotta go. Bye.

461
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,761
[grunting]

462
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,012
[phone rings]

463
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,223
[Rutabaga over phone] Carolyn.

464
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,183
Rutabaga, this is not a good time.

465
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,477
Okay. Can I please just tell you
about the opera, though?

466
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,520
[groans]

467
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,481
- How did you like the opera?
- I loved it.

468
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,151
Loved Tristan, loved Isolde,
cried like a bunny.

469
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,320
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

470
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,323
for the past few days
thinking about that Jackie O movie.

471
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,951
I know it's your baby,
but I did make a few calls

472
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,453
and got my Rooney a screen test.

473
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,747
I put that movie together for my client.

474
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,499
No, no, no, don't freak out.
It's just a screen test.

475
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,044
But, honestly,
how fantaj would my Rooney be

476
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,587
as a young Jackie Bouv?

477
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,342
Stomp once for so fantaj,
twice for stupid-fantaj.

478
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,470
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.

479
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,556
Oh. Carolyn, I heart you.
You're beautiful.

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,475
I wish I met you before I got married.

481
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,434
[groans]

482
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,645
[man on recording]
You can do it.

483
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,231
Only you hold the keys
to the house that is you.

484
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,192
The house is at the top of a hill.

485
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,527
The hill is also you.

486
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,570
[knock on door]

487
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,905
Five minutes, Mr. Horseman.

488
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,325
[man on recording]
When you get your new attitude,

489
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,410
you're gonna wave goodbye to the old--

490
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,829
[phone ringing]

491
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,665
[groans]

492
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,874
What do you want, Mom?

493
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,669
Look who finally decided
to pick up the phone.

494
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,130
- Do you need more blood?
- I don't need blood.

495
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,966
- I read your book, BoJack.
- Oh.

496
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,552
It takes a real narcissist to think
anyone wants to buy a book about him.

497
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,805
You know how I feel about Anne Frank.

498
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,391
- That was a diary.
- I read the parts about me.

499
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,519
The things I said to you.

500
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,813
You must think I'm a real monster.

501
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,565
- Mom--
- I don't wanna fight you, BoJack.

502
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,652
I just wanted to tell you I know.

503
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,780
I know you wanna be happy,
but you won't be, and--

504
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,075
- I'm sorry.
- What?

505
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,661
It's not just you, you know.

506
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,372
Your father and I, we--

507
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:20,960
Well, you come by it honestly,
the ugliness inside you.

508
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,839
You were born broken,
that's your birthright.

509
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,009
And now you can fill your life
with projects

510
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,429
your books and your movies
and your little girlfriends

511
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,307
but it won't make you whole.

512
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,809
You're BoJack Horseman.

513
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,312
There's no cure for that.

514
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:44,108
Anyway, do you remember
who directed The Philadelphia Story?

515
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,985
Five letters, second letter U?

516
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,908
- Lubitsch?
- [sighs] No, BoJack. Goodbye.

517
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,117
[call disconnects]

518
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,161
[man on recording]
You need to visualize it

519
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,455
flying out the window, over the--

520
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,631
What are you doing here?

521
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,551
