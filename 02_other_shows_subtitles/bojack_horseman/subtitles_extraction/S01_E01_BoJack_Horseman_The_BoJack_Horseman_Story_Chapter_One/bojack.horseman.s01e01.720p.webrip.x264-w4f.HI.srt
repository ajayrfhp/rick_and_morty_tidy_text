00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,749
Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.

168
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,460
It takes a lot of beer to get me drunk.

169
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:29,544
Yes.

170
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,171
Ah, yeah, I see.

171
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,131
You're just bummed out
because Princess Carolyn

172
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,466
dumped you last night.

173
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:36,510
[jazz music]

174
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:38,303
BoJack, we need to talk.

175
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,763
Hey, check out the rug on that guy.

176
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,139
Slow and steady, am I right, ladies?

177
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,223
[girls giggle]

178
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,642
Ha-cha-cha.

179
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:45,143
Who does he think he's fooling?

180
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,603
Turtles don't have hair.

181
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:47,855
Stop embarrassing me.

182
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,439
That is Lenny Turteltaub.

183
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:51,025
You know, I am not crazy
about the bread here.

184
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,108
Mm.

185
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,652
Why do I keep eating it?

186
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,571
BoJack, can you please
just listen for a second?

187
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:59,867
You have my undivided attention.

188
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,327
I think we should see other people.

189
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,454
Were we not seeing other people?

190
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,915
[moaning]

191
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,834
BoJack, I'm almost there.

192
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,293
Wait. Shh! Shut up.

193
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:13,463
Now, that's a horse of a different...

194
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,548
cruller?

195
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,383
Oh!

196
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,219
God, that's good comedy.

197
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,888
- BoJack!
- What?

198
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,138
Everyone gets a mulligan,

199
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,183
and my mulligan was Carey Mulligan.

200
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,103
I'm kidding, jeez. It was Emily Mortimer.

201
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,938
- [scoffs]
- What is the problem here?

202
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,982
Are you embarrassed of
me because I'm a has-been?

203
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,692
Because you know that I'm writing that book

204
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,694
that is gonna make everybody love me again.

205
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,654
You're not really writing a book.

206
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:38,906
Well, I already spent my advance,

207
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,240
so that's a first step.

208
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,909
Look, this has been a lot of fun,

209
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:43,660
but I need to start
thinking about my future.

210
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,662
I mean, you don't even respect me enough

211
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:46,747
to have a baby with me.

212
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,831
Whoa, what?

213
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,374
I never explicitly said that.

214
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,001
You said it with your actions.

215
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,127
What actions?

216
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,213
Oh, look at that baby.

217
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,424
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

218
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,926
What? What? What? No, no, wha...

the stolen vehicle, sir!

226
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,024
[BoJack] No, no, no.
Misunderstanding, officer.

227
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,692
I was running away from my girlfriend

228
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,028
whom I don't respect
enough to have a baby with.

229
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:20,447
[cop] Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

230
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,075
Oh, face it. You're afraid of commitment.

231
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,701
I'm not afraid of commitment.

232
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:26,327
I commit to things all the time.

233
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:28,038
It's the following
through on that commitment

234
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,205
that I take issue with.

235
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,041
Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

236
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,626
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

237
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,002
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

238
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,254
Is that BoJack Horseman?

239
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,714
Oh, jeez, here we go.

240
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,091
Mr. Peanutbutter

241
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,969
and BoJack Horseman in the same room.

242
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,304
What is this, a crossover episode?

243
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:46,140
You know, that gets funnier every time.

244
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,724
You're being sarcastic,

245
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,601
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

246
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,019
We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

247
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,813
- so if you could just...
- Yeah?

248
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,397
- You're in the middle of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

249
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,442
So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

250
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,986
Yes, actually, it's very awkward.

251
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,236
Is that not clear?

252
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,781
Yeah, this is awkward right now?

253
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,032
Yes, please leave.

254
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,617
How are you, Mr. Peanutbutter?

255
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,078
Oh, living the dream,
P.C., living the dream.

256
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,579
Why are you making conversation?

257
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,081
Oh, let's see, it's the English word...

258
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,000
It's called being polite, BoJack.

259
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,085
But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

260
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,420
Always a Clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

261
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,797
What?

262
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,423
You'll get that one later, man.

263
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,258
Erica, get out of here with that face.

264
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,510
Would it kill you to be civil?

265
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,220
This is why we're breaking up.

266
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,263
So it's not because of
the thing with the baby?

267
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,099
It's because of a lot of things!

268
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:30,642
Waiter, could we please have the check?

269
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,227
- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.

270
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,063
I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.

271
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:37,607
I don't know how you can
expect anyone else to love you

272
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:39,359
when you so clearly hate yourself.

273
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,070
- Here you go.
- Let me see that.

274
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:45,240
$10 for bread?

275
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,950
I don't want to live in a society

276
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,660
where the premeal bread isn't free.

277
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:51,538
It is free if you order a meal.

278
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,165
Can you take me home, please?

279
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,708
Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.

280
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,792
What did I have? I must have had...

281
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:58,003
You ate nine baskets, sir.

282
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,462
Nine... really?

283
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,631
Great, now I'm gonna feel
like a fat ass all week.

284
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,468
You've seen me naked. Do
you think I'm getting chubby?

285
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:07,095
You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?

286
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,263
What was that? Sorry.

287
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,598
Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.

288
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:12,684
This is so classic you.

289
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,102
You're using this bread thing

290
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,021
to avoid talking about our relationship.

291
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,981
No, that is definitely not happening.

292
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:19,774
I'd like to go home now.

293
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,403
You think I'm fat.

294
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,321
So yeah, technically I was dumped,

295
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,157
but the real headline of the evening was,

296
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,659
"Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, the end."

297
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,079
What kind of headline is that?

298
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,289
Wasn't there a pizza here a second ago?

299
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,583
God damn it! Stop the presses.

300
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,418
You're not fat.

301
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,088
Oh, hey, let's throw a
party. That'll cheer you up.

302
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,673
No, it won't. It'll cheer you up.

303
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,133
I'll stand in the corner by myself

304
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:46,801
eating cotton candy until I barf

305
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,803
like I did at your last party.

306
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:52,432
Hey, aren't you the
horse from Horsin' Around?

307
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,851
[retching]

308
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,978
That was a good party.

309
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,814
Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?

310
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,317
Who told you Princess
Carolyn and I broke up?

311
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,069
- She did.
- What?

312
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,695
You never took me home, jerk!

313
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,530
Oh, everything's my fault.

314
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,199
Take me home.

315
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,243
Okay, jeez.

316
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:13,078
But I'm not looking for
parking in Silver Lake.

317
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,370
I'll slow the car down to a crawl,

318
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,455
and you can duck and roll.

319
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,709
You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,

320
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,295
because it's the last
time you're gonna see it.

321
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,378
Hey-up!

322
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,339
[screams]

[cell phone vibrates] [upbeat tune plays]

324
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,052
Hello?

325
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,470
I've got Princess Carolyn for you.

326
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:31,972
Uh, okay.

327
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:33,223
BoJack.

328
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,808
Oh, my God, we just broke up.

329
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,476
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.

330
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,103
I pride myself on my ability

331
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:40,688
to separate my professional
life from my personal life.

332
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,815
Great.

333
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,025
Then, as my agent, do
you think I'm getting fat?

334
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,193
No way.

335
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,445
You are in the prime of your
life, never looked better.

336
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,696
What about as my ex-girlfriend?

337
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,657
You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap

338
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,242
and then crapped out a third pile of crap.

339
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,828
Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?

340
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,746
- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.

341
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,414
I'm not calling you as your ex.

342
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,334
I'm calling you as your agent.

343
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,210
Remember that book you're
pretending to write?

344
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,462
Well, Penguin wants an
update on your progress.

345
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:05,880
Does Tuesday work for you,

346
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:07,299
or are you gonna be too busy this week

347
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,050
masturbating to old pictures of yourself?

348
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,969
I told you, that's not what
was happening that time.

349
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,554
I was masturbating to what
the picture represented.

350
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,849
You walked in at the worst possible moment!

351
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,517
So, Tuesday, though?

352
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,643
Yes, fine!

353
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,520
[laid-back rock music]

354
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,105
Whoo!

355
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:23,690
You don't have anything?

356
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:24,774
Hey, you got the electricity back.

357
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,067
Good for you.

358
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:27,277
This company is in dire straits.

359
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,945
[screams] [alarm blares]

360
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,613
We made a series of very bad investments.

361
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,157
Ever hear of a young adult franchise

362
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,908
called the Swamp Monsters of Malibu?

363
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,451
Uh, no.

364
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:41,333
Then why did we spend
$20 million on marketing?

365
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,127
It's okay, Pinky, go to your happy place.

366
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:45,379
Uh...

367
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:46,462
Look, I know you're a busy guy.

368
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:47,547
Actually, I am a busy guy.

369
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,007
I live a very active lifestyle.

370
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,675
[laughter on TV]

371
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,220
Can't I just stay home with you?

372
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,680
I know kindergarten is scary,

373
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,682
but you're a big girl now,

374
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,976
and you have to be brave.

375
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,477
Okay, Daddy.

376
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:06,149
Wait, did you just call me "Daddy"?

377
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,943
Little Sabrina grew up right
before our eyes, right, Todd?

378
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:10,486
Todd?

379
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,571
Todd!

380
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,864
What?

381
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,782
Did Sabrina grow up before our eyes?

382
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,034
Yes!

We're tired of waiting.

We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

386

Diane "Nugent"?

387
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:25,126
She's great, and she's
got a thing for horses.

388
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,170
Check this out.

389
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,880
Hey, Secretariat.

390
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:30,506
You know, I always wanted to
play Secretariat in a movie.

391
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,133
He's kind of my personal hero.

392
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,719
Could never get the project
off the ground, though.

393
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:36,763
I mean, there was this one
time I came close in the '90s,

394
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,514
but then those Prefontaine movies came out,

395
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,475
and people got tired of
seeing running on-screen.

396
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,643
Don't tell me. Tell her!

397
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,145
She's cute.

398
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:46,398
Call her. That's a loan, by the way.

399
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,649
We can't afford to be giving
out free books to people,

400
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,277
but you can take anything you want

401
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,612
from the Swamp Monsters swag box.

Oh, God, I'm a failure.

Oh, you're not a failure.

406
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:03,623
Why did I say I could write a book?

407
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,792
Because you have an amazing story to tell.

408

- Relax.
- Relax?

409

Easy for you to say, you hippie.

410
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,923
You've never had a day
of stress in your life.

00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,674
Ow. Why?

412
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:17,512
And that's for trying to
sell E on the cartel's turf.

413

[coughs]

Oh, where's Gabriela?

She went back to Mexico City, ese,

to be with her husband.

417

What? No!

418
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,068
- Gabriela, why?
- Who?

419
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,487
We were talking about me.

420
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,280
Can you try to focus for, like, a second?

421
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,115
Oh, yeah, sorry. You were saying?

422
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,866
Never should have signed this book deal.

423
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,951
You know what my problem is?

424
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,202
I can't say no to people

425
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:42,703
because I want everyone to like me.

426
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:46,249
You want everyone to like you?

427
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,625
Yeah, why?

428
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,002
Do people not like me?

we lost 'cause of you?

and now I got a hundred guests

it off to some stranger.

It's too much pressure.

This book is my one shot
at preserving my legacy.

Well, finishing my memoir, I guess.

655
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,347
Is that all? I can help you with that.

656
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah? I mean, would you even want to?

657
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:44,184
You'd have to spend a lot of time with me.

658
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:45,603
You'd probably get sick of me.

659
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,146
I don't think that's going to happen.

660
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,148
- No?
- No, BoJack.

661
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,775
Okay.

662
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,610
Well, then I guess you're hired,

663
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:54,946
but don't put all that stuff
about how sad I am in the book.

664
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,238
Oh, that doesn't count.

665
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,406
We weren't on the clock yet.

666
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,866
Yeah, exactly.

667
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,330
You're only my ghostwriter starting nah...

668
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:05,999
- Starting now.
- You got it.

669
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,001
- BoJack!
- Ugh, this guy.

670
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,877
Hey, man, wanted to let you know,

671
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:11,462
you are out of beer.

672
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:12,797
Oh, I see you've met

673
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,423
my beautiful girlfriend, Diane Nguyen.

674
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:15,925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

675
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,176
You drank all my beer?

676
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,219
- Also, you two are dating?
- Yeah.

677
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:21,014
- You're dating him?
- Yes.

678
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,181
This is your boyfriend?

679
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:23,599
- That is correct.
- Uh-huh.

680
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,559
- You are going out with you?
- Uh-huh.

681
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,269
But in a sexual way, not just as friends?

682
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:28,688
- That's right.
- You have seen her naked.

683
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:29,981
Many times, yes.

684
00:23:30,064 --> 00:23:31,440
- You are attracted to this?
- Yes.

685
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,233
This penis has been inside this vagina.

686
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,360
- Yep.
- But in a sexual way.

687
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,737
Oh, yes.

688
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:37,947
Humph.

689
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,491
[retching]

690
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:41,993
- Ugh.
- Oh, my God.

691
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:44,537
[retching]

692
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,788
Are you okay?

693
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:46,873
I'm just...

694
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,750
[retching] I'm fine.

695
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,460
I'm just... I'm really happy for you.

696
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:52,545
[retching]

697
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:54,338
Should we get someone, or...

698
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,965
No, everything's...

699
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,884
Oh, this is really...

700
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,426
Wonderful.

701
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,594
Oh, God.

702
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:03,430
[retching]

703
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:05,766
Starting now.
