1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,050
[thunder rumbling]

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,169
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,009
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,809
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,429
Isn't that right, Checkers?

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,769
That's what it says
on your business cards.

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,690
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,109
I'm Secretariat.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,320
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,240
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,359
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,200
Please, I'll do anything.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,369
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,369
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
arranged.

15
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,259
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.
My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,380
He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,

17
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,390
which is necessary
to protect our way of life.

18
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,600
And another hero is President Nixon.

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,020
He is one groovy dude.

20
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,400
[BoJack] Groovy.

21
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,900
[coughing]

22
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,069
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,239
Sorry, Mommy!

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,819
Don't you dare put that out.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,909
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

26
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,079
But I don't wanna.

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,370
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,079
Finish it.

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,159
[coughing]

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,920
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,299
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

32
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,460
You wanted this.

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,969
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

34
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,469
I'm punishing you for being alive.

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,229
Ugh.

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,349
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the--

37
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,400
[fire roaring]

38
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,030
Fine. I'll call 911.

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,319
[♪♪]

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,710
The fire department got
everything under control,

41
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,629
but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,800
I don't understand
what started the fire.

43
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,670
Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

44
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,469
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,389
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

46
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:05,060
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

47
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,139
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

48
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,139
Why did you call me?

49
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,099
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

50
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,020
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,610
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

52
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,569
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

53
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,280
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,990
In da White House.

55
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,870
What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?

56
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,289
-Things changed a little.
-You cut the Nixon scene?

57
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,579
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,090
Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted

59
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,500
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,840
It's still all that,
except now it happens

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,969
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

62
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,300
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

63
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,099
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,889
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

65
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,180
People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

66
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,349
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

67
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,020
-Warts and all.
-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

68
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,530
That's why they took the gay stuff
out of A Beautiful Mind.

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,689
Know that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

70
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,659
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

71
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,530
-Kelsey, you're okay with this?
-Eh...

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,659
That's showbiz.

73
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,240
See, BoJack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

74
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,960
Good shrugging, kid.

75
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,419
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

77
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,759
We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,089
Oh, okay.

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,720
Ooh, ow.

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,769
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

82
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,939
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

83
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,439
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

84
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,029
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

85
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,199
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

86
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,819
I've been here 20 years.

87
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,409
Who's gonna water the plants?

88
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,079
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

89
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,699
I started doing it as an intern,

90
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,620
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

91
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,290
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

92
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,379
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

93
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,759
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I--

94
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,509
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

95
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,680
and your second favorite
Gnarls Barkley song.

96
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't want crazy.

97
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,389
I've got five episodes
of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,889
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,769
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

100
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,279
-[Carolyn] Gekko?!
-But I'd rather look at you all day.

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,240
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,910
And I think we could make something
really special.

103
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,159
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

104
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,620
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

105
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,170
Stuart, I'm your boss.

106
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,379
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

107
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,879
-What, I'm the idiot?
-[sighs]

108
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,930
[Diane] The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

109
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:51,600
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

110
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,139
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

111
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,730
and I'll believe almost anything.

112
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,689
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

113
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,689
and next month
the community center is doing Seussical.

114
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,899
There we go.

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,819
[Diane] In his previous life,
Sebastian owned

116
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,529
a chain of high-end department stores.

117
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,279
I want to stock up on muffs.

118
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,779
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

119
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,000
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

120
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,959
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,750
-A real-life newspaper!
-Uh-huh.

122
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,629
But I knew my life was empty.

123
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,629
At night I heard the cries
of children sick and dying.

124
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,420
And I would scream into the night.

125
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,009
Shut up! Shut up, children!

126
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,970
But the phantom cries would not abate.

127
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,720
And so I began my travels,

128
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,220
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

129
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,100
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

130
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,480
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,519
Diane, this is Kinko.

132
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,689
I am Kinko.

133
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,110
In his language, it means,

134
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,860
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

135
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,399
probably from malaria.

136
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,069
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

137
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,870
It means,
my parents liked the show Cheers.

138
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,250
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

139
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,290
[Diane] When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,

140
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,170
you want to believe
that you really are.

141
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,800
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.

142
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,220
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

143
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,050
[Sebastian] Oh, Kinko made a mess.

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,600
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

145
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,639
And cut. Neat.

146
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,769
-Let's break for lunch.
-[kids] Oh!

147
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,189
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

148
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:28,240
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

149
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,569
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

150
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,409
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.
-No, this isn't you.

151
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,079
I've seen everything you've done.

152
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,659
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

153
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

154
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,540
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

155
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,670
we don't have an Oval Office set.

156
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,670
There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.

157
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,629
Why on earth do you know that?

158
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,009
In season three of Horsin' Around,
the horse got elected president

159
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,389
and we shot on location.

160
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,350
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

161
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,930
Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

162
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,470
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
[sighs]

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,810
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
-All right!

165
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,269
Did they really make
your character president?

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Only for season three.

167
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,740
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

168
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,990
They called my airplane Air Horse One.

169
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:14,740
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

170
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,620
-Come on.
-It wasn't our best season.

171
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,990
But on the bright side,
was not our worst.

172
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,870
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...

173
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,920
and steal the scale model.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,089
[man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

175
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,339
I'm Nixon. [chuckles].

176
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,049
[in normal voice] Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

177
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:36,850
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

178
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,429
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

179
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,019
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

180
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,649
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

181
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,480
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

182
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,899
-Is that...
-Here we go.

183
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,070
...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?

184
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:55,820
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

185
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,990
-Hang on.
-One more.

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,450
-Is that the smoke alarm--?
-No.

187
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,120
[chuckles nervously]

188
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,289
So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.

189
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,379
I remember because season three
of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.

190
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,169
All the pressures of being president.

191
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,590
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.
-We're gonna need a crack team.

192
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,590
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

193
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,179
-Not interested.
-Okay.

194
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,059
The second best lock-pick in the city.

195
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,019
-No way I'm doing that.
-Got it.

196
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,139
A lock-pick.

197
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,559
Todd, can you pick locks?

198
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,649
-Kind of.
-Great. You're in.

199
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,269
We'll need an expert cat burglar.

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,570
All right, Good Wife,
let's see what you got.

201
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,190
[BoJack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

202
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,990
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

203
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,659
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.

204
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,659
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,830
Are you in?

206
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,669
[man] Hey! Shut up down there!

207
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,250
-[BoJack] You shut up!
-[man] Make me!

208
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,750
[BoJack] Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

209
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

210
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,919
[groans]

211
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,509
[BoJack]
We'll need someone to play Checkers.

212
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,220
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

213
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,679
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

214
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,429
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

215
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,269
but I'm super-busy recording promos

216
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,480
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

217
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,690
-We can probably do it without you.
-This next one's for Seattle.

218
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,860
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

219
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,409
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

220
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,779
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

221
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:25,080
The more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

222
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,750
It's just a single on Secretariat.

223
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,669
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?

224
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,129
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
-You know what? Forget I even asked.

225
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,799
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
-Okay.

226
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,429
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.

227
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,799
Character actress Margo Martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

228
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm glad I served my time.

229
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,639
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

230
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,440
and get back to doing small roles

231
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,059
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

232
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,980
[prison guard] Watch, purse, lipstick,

233
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,779
Emmy Award
for Best Guest Actress.

234
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,740
[sighs deeply]

235
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,200
I need your help with a break-in.

236
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,210
BoJack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

237
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,000
What took you so long?

238
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,879
[tires squealing]

239
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,629
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

240
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,720
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

241
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,129
They're on high alert

242
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,389
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

243
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,720
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

244
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,850
[laughs] Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

245
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,730
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

246
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,279
-Totally.
-Now, we need to lose the cops.

247
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
The rest of you will create a diversion

248
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,279
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

249
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,779
the Discount Fine Art Gallery
in the strip mall,

250
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,200
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

251
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,789
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

252
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,580
[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

253
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,549
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

254
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,379
-Possibly Alan.
-Why possibly Alan?

255
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,639
Well, you are the guy
none of us knows that well.

256
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,470
I just came to fix your cable.

257
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,720
Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

258
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,269
-But--
-Hey, you think you could keep it down?

259
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,190
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

260
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,519
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

261
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,440
We're almost done.

262
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,399
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

263
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,779
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

264
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,110
-I live here, too.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

265
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,950
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

266
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,539
I can't die. I'm endangered!

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,169
[Diane] "And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish

268
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,289
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of Brooklynites

269
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,000
and the less discerning Staten Islander."

270
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,879
When I grow up, I can be food critic
for New Yorker?

271
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,009
You can do anything you want in life.

272
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,759
Not everyone can write for The New Yorker,

273
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,759
but there's always The Atlantic.

274
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,139
[Sebastian] Diane,

275
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,690
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

276
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,769
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

277
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,610
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

278
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,570
I'm here to help these people.

279
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,029
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

280
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,240
so people back home will give money
to my foundation.

281
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,529
Great.

282
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,210
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

283
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,129
[alarm wailing]

284
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,500
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

285
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,379
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

286
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,179
Why do you all keep saying that?

287
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,600
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

288
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,100
Alan, we've got enough problems without
worrying about your imminent death.

289
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,980
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

290
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:37,350
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?

291
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,480
Like,
look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

292
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,940
It's simple.

293
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,610
And serene. And... pleasant.

294
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,990
[sighs]

295
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,240
I think that the vest
makes me look kind of chunky.

296
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,620
I don't do CrossFit five days a week
to not look sweet in this uniform.

297
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,620
I swear to God,
if you don't shut up about CrossFit--

298
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,580
[woman over radio]
Break-in at the Discount

299
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,210
Fine Art Gallery at the strip mall.

300
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,919
Let's roll!
That's a thing we say at CrossFit.

301
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,419
[police sirens wailing]

302
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,769
[BoJack shouts]

303
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,070
Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's House was

304
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,320
-elected president?
-Let me guess, it was all a dream?

305
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,570
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

306
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,820
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

307
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,080
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

308
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,789
and not enough time being a dad.

309
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,750
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

310
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,500
Okay, I'd like you here.

311
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,750
And then you are going to be over here.

312
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,710
-Freeze!
-I'm union.

313
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,669
-Playing dead.
-Breaking and entering?

314
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,169
That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

315
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,389
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

316
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,970
Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

317
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,350
-Uh...
-Or is it about how he had

318
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:56,389
an illegitimate son,

319
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,019
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

320
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,820
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon Library?

321
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
The second one?

322
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,110
Well, if that's true, how come you don't
have an actor here to play Nixon?

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,820
Because...

324
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:15,120
we couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.

325
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

326
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,210
You? No way.

327
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,750
[as Nixon] Hello, I'm Nixon.

328
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,960
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am
your father and I love you very much.

329
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,549
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

330
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,090
We've found our Nixon.

331
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,129
[in normal voice] I can be ready in five.

332
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,590
Uh. Did we get the shot?

333
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,889
It's so peaceful.

334
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,519
-Okay, folks.
-[all] Aah!

335
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,100
Party's over.
That's something we say at CrossFit.

336
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,559
Ugh. Wait a sec-- I know you!

337
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,070
You were in Justified.
You were amazing.

338
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,399
Okay, you caught me.

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,200
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

340
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,200
I am such a huge fan, Miss, uh--

341
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,490
What--? What's your name?

342
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Sure, of course.

343
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,909
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

344
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,330
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

345
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,710
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

346
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,879
-How about you enjoy this? Aah!
-[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

347
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:10,299
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

348
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,549
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

349
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,600
But you're also chewing gum.

350
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,759
I'm a wild card.

351
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,350
-Aah!
-Return fire!

352
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:21,730
Watch out!

353
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,350
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

354
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,019
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

355
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,240
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

356
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,450
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

357
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,370
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

358
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,830
See you later!

359
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:40,750
-[police sirens wailing]
-[guns cocking]

360
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,539
Die, you chunky assholes!

361
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,840
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

362
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,090
[all shouting]

363
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,840
[cop] Shoot!

364
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,549
Oh.

365
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,309
-How could this be any more perfect?
-[sing-song] Yoo-hoo.

366
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,809
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

367
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm your servant, of course.

368
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,150
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

369
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,740
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

370
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,740
to be a "Hollywoo" power-agent.

371
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,240
Also, my husband left me.

372
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,829
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

373
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,500
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

374
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,210
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

375
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,170
-Right away, ma'am.
-Ah.

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Diane...

377
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,009
[Diane] The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

378
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,089
is how much he talks about himself.

379
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,680
This way is the library I built.

380
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,349
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

381
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,559
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

382
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,900
-Put a chapter in your book about that.
-Uh-huh.

383
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,609
[Diane] The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,

384
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,400
and even then, sometimes...

385
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:54,819
[bomb whistling, explodes]

386
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,819
-[Diane gasps]
-[people scream nearby]

387
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,160
Everybody--
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

388
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,619
--let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

389
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,539
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

390
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,750
-Where's Kinko? Is he okay?
-Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

391
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,170
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

392
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,630
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

393
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,970
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

394
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,640
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

395
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,269
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

396
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,480
This is too much.

397
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,599
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

398
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,519
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

399
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,940
-But if you can't, you can go home.
-I...

400
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:36,990
I can handle it.

401
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:40,240
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

402
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

403
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,119
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

404
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,710
-If I call the police, will I get a line?
-No, we won't use it in the movie.

405
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,420
We only need the one-shot of me.

406
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,009
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

407
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:00,130
-Ugh. Actors.
-Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

408
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,259
[as Nixon] I'm Nixon.

409
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,099
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

410
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,349
about the son I'll never know.

411
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,730
But I look at the moon and so does he.
That's how I know we're connected.

412
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,190
And I'm Checkers.

413
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,769
[Kelsey] All right, so, BoJack,

414
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,190
you've been told
that your brother, Jeffretariat,

415
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,819
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

416
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,869
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

417
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,329
And the tears start to flow.

418
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,700
And the tears start to flow.

419
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,039
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

420
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,460
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

421
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,920
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

422
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,210
Really, never? Come on.

423
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,509
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

424
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:43,180
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

425
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,430
but then... [sobs]

426
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:47,599
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

427
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,599
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

428
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,559
Can you give us the room, please?

429
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,190
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

430
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,950
-Oh!
-Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

431
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,069
Ah.

432
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,079
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

433
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,539
[sighs]

434
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:12,710
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

435
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,420
I just landed a new client.

436
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,839
-The mill owner!
-Huh?

437
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,420
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

438
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,470
-Wait, you're making deals here?
-I'll say.

439
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,470
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic New England village.

440
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,720
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic New England village trades.

441
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,970
What? No!

442
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,599
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

443
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,190
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

444
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,150
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

445
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,440
and enough time to catch up
on The Good Wife.

446
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,359
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

447
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,359
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

448
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,779
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

449
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,950
[sing-song] Bye!

450
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,670
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

451
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,500
Get your demo guys together.

452
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,250
Let's tear this old Tudor down
and put up some condos! [chuckles]

453
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,460
Okay.

454
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,259
[Margo laughing]

455
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,890
This isn't just for me.

456
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,890
It's for John Carroll Lynch,
C.C.H. Pounder,

I'm character actress Margo Martindale!

Listen, I gotta tell you:

I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

A lot of people talk big,

This is the moment
that Secretariat stops running.

Because this is the moment you realize
