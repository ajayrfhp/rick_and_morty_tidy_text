1
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,014
As your accountant,
I felt it necessary to do this in person.

2
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,768
Us, too. Because we're really
accounting on you...

3
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,937
-No.
-to get in on the ground floor of this...

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,646
No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,856
...PB Livin' product.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,191
Has this ever happened to you?

7
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,403
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,615
-You say you love a toasted bagel.
-I would never say that.

9
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,910
-I have celiac disease.
-Ding. Bagel's ready.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,620
-But wait.
-Son of a--

11
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,163
-Hey. That bagel was too fast.
-No.

12
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,626
That's why PB Livin' presents,
the Bagel Catcher.

13
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,796
-For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
-No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,131
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,133
PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

16
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,344
-I'm shutting you down.
-I thought you were a customer.

17
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,888
I don't get what's happening.

18
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,057
What's happening is you two knuckleheads
threw thousands of dollars

19
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,893
into a bunch of dumb ideas.

20
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:02,605
You paid 50 grand
to a bunch of kindergartners

21
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,983
for the movie rights
to the game "tag."

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,276
Our business manager
was over the moon for that.

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,988
Business manager?
Who the hell is your business manager?

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,617
Business-wise, this all seems
like appropriate business.

25
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,285
You two are done.

26
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,539
This company is more in the red
than Carrie on prom night.

27
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:25,503
So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,964
No. You're-- [grunts]
You are out of money.

29
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,676
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you need to get a job.

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,095
-Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
-Dude, no.

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,144
I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.

32
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,897
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

33
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,068
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.

34
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,738
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.

35
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,825
Maybe I should just go check on him.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,784
[knocking on door]

37
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,454
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

38
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,207
Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're--
Oh! Oh, my God.

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,209
Ronnie, how'd you get that belt
around your neck,

40
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,879
then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down

41
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:11,924
while you were researching pornograph--
Oh, I see what happened here.

42
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,679
[♪♪]

43
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,647
[upbeat theme music playing]

44
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,232
[in unison]
Morning time, Hollywoo.

45
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,527
-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
-And I'm Some Lady.

46
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,154
Here's a thing written on a card.

47
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,533
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie
Bonito was found dead in his office...

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,576
Ruh-roh.

49
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,163
...in what authorities are calling
a mishap of a sexual nature.

50
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,584
-What does that mean?
-You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

51
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,419
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

52
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,338
Oh, is that that thing
where you strangle yourself

53
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,050
in an attempt to heighten
sexual arousal?

54
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,843
It sure is.

55
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,262
[hosts laughing on TV]

56
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,724
Coming up, a food truck that serves
just one thing: gravy.

57
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,392
Did you hear that? New food truck.

58
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,936
-We should go.
-I'm in.

59
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,521
Hey, can I get some lunch money?
It's pizza day today.

60
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,816
Sure thing, sport.
Wait, where is it pizza day?

61
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,525
-In my tummy.
-Oh...

62
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,612
Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up?
My shoulder is killing me.

63
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,907
I'm not sleeping right.
We need to do something about that bed.

64
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,660
Just because I'm nocturnal
doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.

65
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,370
-I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
-It still wobbles.

66
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,539
-Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
-Oh.

67
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,584
A beeper? BoJack, it's great,
but you know, I already have one.

68
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,795
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

69
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,339
Now, you can page me
whenever you want.

70
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,135
Huh. BoJack, I love it,
and you're gonna love it, too.

71
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,261
There's all kinds of codes
we can send each other.

72
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,181
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

73
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,643
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"
and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

74
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,812
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.

75
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,522
What scamp came up with that one?

76
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,315
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

77
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,985
Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

78
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,112
Okay, love you.

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,446
Uh...

80
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,115
Uh...

81
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,076
No, I don't.

82
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,288
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

83
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,126
Uh... Keys.

84
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,293
Uh-oh.

85
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,920

[girl cries]

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,219
Get out.

88
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:02,887
[BoJack yells]

Hold it. Hold the elevator.

92
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,943
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

93
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,071
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

94
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,489
Oh. Ow. Oh...

95
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,034
Coffee? Hup.

96
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,703
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

97
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,122
My heel broke
while I was at this new food truck,

98
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,374
and I spilled a handful of gravy
all over myself

99
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,586
because they don't sell bowls,
just gravy.

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,714
Should've gone to the bowl truck first.
That's where they get you.

101
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,383
Well, I guess the upside to being
invisible around here

102
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,762
is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.

103
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,389
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I see what a mess you are.

104
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,766
[chuckles] Aw...

105
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,768
Do you need the movie-star speech?

106
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,979
No, no, I'll be okay.
And how are you?

107
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,940
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

108
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,609
I have to pick a shade that won't clash
with the splatter of blood

109
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,153
from when I blow my brains out
after talking to Katie

110
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,282
about paint swatches all day. [laughs]

111
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,033
We do have fun.

112
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,373
So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?

113
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:18,087
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
Mr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.

114
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,256
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

115
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,716
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,552
But also, like, find a new agent
and go on auditions, right?

117
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,638
Or should I start stealing food
from work?

118
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,016
I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,561
-Que sera quesadilla.
-You know we could lose the house, right?

120
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,521
-[laughs] Diane.
-Right?

121
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,732
Diane, Diane, Diane.

122
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,567
[door opens then closes]

123
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,827
-Diane.
-Aah!

124
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,788
I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?

125
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,373
Here's a funny question for you:

126
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,834
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,212
would you need to talk about that later
and figure out what he meant?

128
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,965
Probably not, right?
Because they're meaningless words?

129
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,633
I mean, language evolves, right?

130
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,551
How can anyone know
what anything means?

131
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,887
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.

132
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,764
So why bother talking about anything?

133
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,851
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter
and I living in our house?

134
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,479
Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,982
as we struggle through
our Dickensian-style poverty?

136
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:20,899
Uh...

137
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,193
[beeper plays ringtone]

138
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,736
"Zero, zero, zero."
No idea what that means.

139
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,280
I think it means "call me."

140
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,615
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

141
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,950
How do I ignore?

142
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,494
I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.

143
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,580
-With what, my mind?
-You seem a little stressed out.

144
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,833
That's because
as soon as I'm done with work,

145
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,918
I have to have a long,
awkward conversation

146
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:44,423
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless... I'm never done with work.

147
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,592
Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.

148
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,226
I'll be out there in the stands.

149
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,228
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.

150
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,522
Mm. Yeah.

151
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,318
[groans]

152
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,987
Your line is,
"And I'll see you at the finish line."

153
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:10,949
Yeah, I know. I'm acting.
Great. Now I gotta start all over.

154
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,327
Settle in, folks.
We could be here a while.

155
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,995
[groans]

156
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,208
-Ow! Ooh.
-Ah, Princess Carolyn.

157
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,877
So good of you to join us eventually.

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,213
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

159
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,673
You know who had an even
"the worst-er" morning?

160
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,760
-Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.
-He is?

161
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,096
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

162
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,849
and now that sweet chariot
has come for to carry him home.

163
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,061
Everyone who was here on time
is taking a moment.

164
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,147
-Of silence?
-Yes.

165
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,234
Also to reach out to his former clients.

166
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,903
-To offer their condolences?
-Yes.

167
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,739
Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.

168
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,159
-A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
-Who do you want me to call?

169
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:58,163
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:

170
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,251
-Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
-Oh, that's wonderful news

171
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,629
in the parallel universe
in which you were on time today.

172
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,548
In this reality, however, we're all good.

173
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,884
You can lap up the leftovers though.

174
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,595
-"Mr. Peanutbutter"?
-Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

175
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,930
Get your shoe fixed.

176
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,975
You look like a woman
from an '80s deodorant commercial.

177
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,106
[inhales sharply]

178
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:28,277
Here I go.
Destiny, don't fail me now. [grunts]

179
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,739
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

180
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,200
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

181
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,750
[grunts] Ew...

182
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,044
Out of my way, flyer.

183
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,966
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

184
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,552
Wait, a second. Shoe.

185
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,262
Store.

186
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,889
Shoe store? Shoe store.

187
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,599
"Team players wanted"?

188
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,685
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

189
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,771
I make all the other team players
look like garbage.

190
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,108
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

191
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,699
Finish... [grunts]

192
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,370
line.

193
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,414
Great, we got it. We got one take.

194
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,166
And now we gotta stop for the day.

195
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,459
What? No. Why stop now?

196
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:29,213
-I'm just getting warmed up.
-Union rules. We're done. Go home.

197
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,464
Go home?

198
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:34,426
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

199
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,095
-Drinks on me, folks.
-I could use a drink.

200
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,764
-Or six.
-Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

201
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,435
[Corduroy] Ah...

202
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,563
-I really needed this, BoJack.
-Me, too.

203
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,814
Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.

204
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,068
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

205
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,070
-Blue-face blastoff?
-The strokey chokey?

206
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,572
-The two-neck squeeze?
-What?

207
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,865
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

208
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,034
the other one's
on the Adam's banana?

209
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,287
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic--

210
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:05,207
That could've been me.
I used to really be into that stuff.

211
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,791
I was a hardcore gasper.

212
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,586
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

213
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,337
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

214
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,590
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

215
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,341
Don't need to talk about
how you masturbate.

216
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,635
-The orgasms you get--
-Okay, I guess we do.

217
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,430
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

218
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,140
-So, like a normal rainbow?
-But it's too dangerous, man.

219
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,352
They say if you bite down on a lemon
right at the point of climax,

220
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,772
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

221
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,026
But still man,
you're just... rolling the dice.

222
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,195
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

223
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,988
Can we maybe
talk about anything else?

224
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,698
-Sure.
-Thank God.

225
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:43,328
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

226
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,455
Uh...

227
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,792
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your Lord and personal savior?

228
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,087
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

229
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,089
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

230
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,804
[grunting softly]

231
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,307
[sighs]

232
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,976
-I beeped you, BoJack.
-Oh, hey. About this morning--

233
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,978
-It's fine.
-Because when I said that--

234
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,355
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

235
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,191
That's okay. I don't love you.

236
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,777
-What?
-Good night.

237
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,363
[upbeat theme music playing]

238
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,240
[in unison]
Morning time, Hollywoo.

239
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,410
-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.
-And I'm Some Lady.

240
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,497
On today's show,
I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous

241
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,916
to discuss his new smash hit,
Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,835
Can you talk about your process?

243
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,087
When I see someone,
and I think they can dance,

244
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,048
I say,
"Hey, I think you can dance."

245
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:41,428
And when I think they can't dance,
I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

246
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,222
-And that is pretty much it.
-Fascinating.

247
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,352
-So, last night when--
-BoJack, it's not a big deal.

248
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
You don't love me, I don't love you.

249
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,523
We're having a good time. It's fine.

250
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,692
Can't just say, "I don't love you"
to someone.

251
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,110
-You said it to me.
-Yeah, but that was different.

252
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,779
-How was that different?
-Because you do love me. Right?

253
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,490
-Like a little bit?
-No.

254
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,826
Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

255
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,120
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

256
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,585
Here you go, ma'am.

257
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,420
[women laughing and chattering]

258
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:19,299
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

259
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,592
Mr. Peanutbutter?

260
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,514
Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?

261
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,727
Either way,
it's a brand-new pair of shoes!

262
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,269
[women clapping and laughing]

263
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,023
Oh.

264
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,317
Hup. Carolyn.

265
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,694
-Rutabaga--
-Coffee?

266
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,820
I was thinking about you last night

267
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,616
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.

268
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,994
And what if I told you I used to work
Ronnie Bonito's desk,

269
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,039
and I happen to know
that he had a client so hush-hush,

270
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,460
-it wasn't even on the master list.
-What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

271
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,378
[alarm ringing]

272
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,882
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

273
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,134
The author of Catcher in the Rye?

274
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,596
-And... others?
-Yuh-huh.

275
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,014
-Isn't he dead?
-He's "reclusive."

276
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:12,269
Dude wanted to be left alone so much,
he faked his own death.

277
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,562
Oh, my God.

278
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,313
Why are you giving this lead to me?

279
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,941
-Because I like you, dummy.
-Huh.

280
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,653
Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.

281
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,243
-Hey.
-Corduroy, what are you doing here?

282
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,495
I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me?

283
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,956
-Ew. Is this your Bible?
-No, no, no.

284
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,041
-It's my choking-off kit.
-Your kit?

285
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,501
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

286
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,630
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.

287
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,716
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.

288
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,843
I don't know if I want
your jack-off kit at my house.

289
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,053
Please. I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.

290
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,348
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo,
it'll break her heart.

291
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,184
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,

292
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,895
they don't want you to choke yourself
while masturbating?

293
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,856
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

294
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,983
-All right. I'll take it.
-Thanks, BoJack.

295
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,068
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.

296
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,112
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

297
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,114
Oh, I guess.

298
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,032
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

299
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,203
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

300
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,670
[Carolyn] Hm...

301
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,509
Oh. Ooh.

302
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,679
-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some--
-Sorry, no looking allowed.

303
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,388
This store is for customers only.

304
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:34,017
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend?

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,144
-One with a bell, or--?
-You got me.

306
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:40,357
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

307
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,153
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.

308
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,155
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?

309
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,990
And others.

310
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,910
-I wanna say The Hobbi--
-Nope.

311
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,370
Look. I'm an agent.

312
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,539
It doesn't matter
whether I've read your work.

313
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,668
What matters is I can look you
in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

314
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,671
The world is ready for your comeback,
and I wanna help.

315
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,130
No, thank you. Not interested.

316
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,007
Did that before, didn't work out well.

317
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,176
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.

318
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,555
And that's why my motto is,
"It's better to be alone."

319
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,264
Which, come to think of it,

320
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,934
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.

321
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,854
But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.

322
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,939
You are a goddamn American treasure.

323
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,568
But every time I go out in the world,
people hound me about my books.

324
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,236
Well, book.

325
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,280
What if I told you there was a place
where no one reads books?

326
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,532
I'm listening.

327
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,702
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.

328
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,120
A place where people
hate reading so much,

329
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,791
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.

330
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,753
What do you mean,
like, modern reading slaves?

331
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,045
Exactly.

332
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,757
And all those modern reading slaves
really wanna be doing

333
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,385
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

334
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,013
-Does such a place truly exist?
-Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

335
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,891
Let's go to Hollywoo.

336
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,440
Hup!

337
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,778
Oh... [sighs]

338
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,195
-Hey.
-Hey.

339
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,948
-We need to talk.
-Okay.

340
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,117
You're probably wondering
what this beautiful mahogany box is.

341
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,537
-I wasn't wondering that.
-It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

342
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,998
I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.

343
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,834
-What? Funky Spider-Man?
-I came up with that one myself.

344
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,753
Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

345
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,548
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

346
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,883
Yes. I do.

347
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,509
Even though it's very dangerous

348
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,177
-and I could die.
-Oh.

349
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,473
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

350
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,768
-Okay. I get it.
-Since you don't, I should do it, right?

351
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,771
I mean, there's no reason not to...
unless you love me.

352
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,314
-Do it.
-Wait. Seriously?

353
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,065
Seems like you've already
made up your mind.

354
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,234
If you're that set on it,
knock yourself out.

355
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,946
[laughs] Only if I do it wrong.

356
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,657
Because as I mentioned before,
it's very dangerous.

357
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,075
-Have fun.
-I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

358
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,454
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

359
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,831
[upbeat theme music playing]

360
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,833
[in unison]
Morning time, Hollywoo.

361
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,668
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

362
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,087
And I'm An Actress Or Something,
I don't know, sitting in for Some Lady.

363
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,799
-Whoa. What happened to her?
-She got kidnapped.

364
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,300
Oh, boy.

365
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,720
[laughs] Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

366
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,016
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

367
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,892
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

368
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,811
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

369
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,856
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

370
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,275
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

371
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,569
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

372
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,947
-Not too late to stop me.
-I'm not gonna stop you.

373
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,199
-Good 'cause don't.
-All right, we're in agreement.

374
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,701
Stop fighting!

375
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,870
Can't you two see
what this is doing to me?

376
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,330
I've been acting out. [grunts]

377
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,749
Have a great day.

378
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,501
Todd? Get in the car.

379
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,462
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

380
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,841
Hooray! Question mark?

381
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,723
Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.

382
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,101
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

383
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,022
Let's say something that could hoist up
a horse comfortably by the neck.

384
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,482
Not for suicide purposes.

385
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,276
I'm trying to have
a more fulfilling orgasm.

386
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,034
The world wept when news broke
that J.D. Salinger died.

387
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,996
-[gasps] J.D. Salinger died?
-But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

388
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,915
[gasps] J.D. Salinger didn't die?

389
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,001
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

390
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,046
J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

391
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,339
eighth graders
and occasionally, assassins.

392
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,467
His spare lyricism
and devotion to character

393
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,263
will undoubtedly translate into
a penetrating dramatic work for this,

394
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,515
the golden age of television writing.

395
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,392
J.D. Take it away.

396
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,855
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

397
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,440
-What?
-Like a game show?

398
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,859
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

399
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:56,154
I think normal people would wanna see
if they know trivia and stuff.

400
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,991
You know, like, Hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

401
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,160
Do they know things? Let's find out.

402
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,830
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

403
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,831
What do you call it?

404
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:10,334
I call it Hollywoo Stars and
Celebrities: What Do They Know?

405
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,587
Do They Know Things?
Let's Find Out.

406
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,380
It's maybe more of a working title.

407
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,257
I can see it on the marquee already.

408
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,093
-Must be a long marquee.
-It's long.

409
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,054
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

410
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:21,972
Oh, it's perfect.

411
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,266
We've been searching for a companion
for Hey, I Think You Can Dance.

412
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,727
But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host?

413
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,772
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

414
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,067
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

415
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,862
Claire, you are looking off the charts
"gorge" in those tennis shoes.

416
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:41,699
But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?

417
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,535
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

418
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,496
-He's perfect.
-[Wanda] Mm-hm.

419
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,956
Mr. Peanutbutter?

420
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,044
How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

421
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,422
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

422
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,341
You know, it just goes to show,

423
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,136
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

424
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,762
will always come true.

425
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,472
And if your dreams don't come true,

426
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,351
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

427
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,233
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

428
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,236
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.

429
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,197
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

430
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,367
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel
coming out of the toaster.

431
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,411
-Come again?
-It was coming fast and hot.

432
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,166
One day, some genius will invent
some sort of bagel catcher

433
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,251
that takes the guesswork out of this task,

434
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,504
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

435
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,884
-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
-Oh...

436
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,347
Oh, boy.

437
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,183
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

438
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,769
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

439
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,437
Well, here I am, for now.

440
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,149
BoJack... Wait.
Did you fix the bed?

441
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,817
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

442
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,238
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic
asphyxiation machine.

443
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,572
Because, as you are aware,

444
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,825
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

445
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,829
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

446
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,748
Okay, BoJack.

447
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,833
Wanna talk about
the elephant in the room?

448
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,254
Wow. Okay. You know what?

449
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,923
You know what? Here's-- First of all--

450
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:24,302
Wow. All right, I can't even-- [groans]

451
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,055
You know what? I-- [scoffs]

452
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:27,972
Wow.

453
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,891
He is never gonna forget that.

454
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,142
What is this all about?

455
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:34,062
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

456
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,355
that feels like a rainbow
with every color.

457
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,024
-So, a regular rainbow.
-No.

458
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,944
So, if you don't mind,
as long as you don't love me,

459
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,362
I have a noose to step into.
[clears throat]

460
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,323
I just need to release this lever,

461
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,825
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

462
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,328
and then just pull this nozzle.

463
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,914
-Perfect.
-Okay. Have fun.

464
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,168
-Wait, Wanda. [grunting and choking]
-Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

465
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:58,544
I love you.

466
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,965
I-- [coughs] I knew it.

467
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,468
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky Spider-Man.

468
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,512
-[coughs] What?
-You need to be responsible for yourself.

469
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,389
-That doesn't sound like me.
-I know.

470
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,392
But if you love me, too,
you won't do it.

471
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,646
[gasps then grunts]

472
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,274
-I thought so.
-Okay.

473
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,735
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

474
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,904
Me not doing it
is not a sign that I love you.

475
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,157
-It's just because I'm a coward.
-[chuckles] Okay.

476
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,866
-I don't love you.
-Sure, you don't.

477
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,410
I don't. Come back here.
I don't love you.

478
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,537
You don't make me feel less broken.

479
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,168
I don't get it.

480
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,797
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show

481
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,218
and resurrected a certified dead man
and nobody cared.

482
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,013
-Why do I do anything?
-[Rutabaga over phone] Hey.

483
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,223
Do you need the movie star speech?

484
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,225
[sighs] Yeah.

485
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,937
Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

486
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,940
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

487
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,901
Where the world tests you,
and people treat you like shit.

488
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,569
But it has to happen this way.

489
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,155
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

490
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,367
when you get everything you want,
won't feel as rewarding.

491
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,412
There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.

492
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,706
Because this movie's not about them.

493
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,333
It's never been about them.

494
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:22,045
All this time, the movie's been about you.

495
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,380
Thanks.

496
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,758
-Carolyn?
-Yes, Rutabaga?

497
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,137
I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.

498
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,891
Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.

499
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,642
Corduroy?

500
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:37,935
Hey, you decent, man?

501
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,229
[gasps]

502
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,605
