00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:11,136
[Mr. Peanutbutter]
So, did you have a good birthday?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,056
-It was an amazing birthday!
-I had a great day, too.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,351
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

4
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,937
Yeah? You weren't too bored

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,564
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,483
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

7
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,526
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,196
I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,617
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,410
It combined my two favorite things:

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,580
modern art
and people talking about modern art.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,332
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

13
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,835
-So, there's nothing else you want?
-No.

14
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,797
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to Prairie Home Companion

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,090
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:53,304
-You don't want anything else?
-No. Today was perfect.

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:59,310
-Any additional thing would be overkill.
-Okay. If you say so.

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,021
-[all] Surprise!
-Oh, my God.

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,315
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

20
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,274
Uh...

21
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,986
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
Now let's party!

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,827
[♪♪]

24
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,549
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

25
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,676
He is dead, goddamn it!

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,386
Uh...

27
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,682
-Hey, we should go.
-No, don't leave.

28
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,100
There's so much party left.

29
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,102
Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

30
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,688
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement--

31
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,690
-Party.
-A prior engagement party.

32
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,360
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

33
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,571
Engagement,
so it's a Prior engagement party.

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,280
-What?
-And we gotta get there early

35
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,367
-because of the. Si...
-The si... Silent auction!

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,994
-Auction, yeah.
-[Peanutbutter] Okay.

37
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:43,915
To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...

38
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,999
-Uh...
-Wareness.

39
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,126
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

40
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,253
-Gotta go.
-Wait, BoJack!

41
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,256
-No! You're my ride.
-Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

42
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,009
-I'll take you home.
-Come on, stick around a little.

43
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,763
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

44
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,140
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

45
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,145
-I give them three months.
-Well, what makes you say that?

46
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,814
Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

47
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,233
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,235
when they got
in that huge screaming match

49
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,446
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

50
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,323
-That was weird.
-I don't wanna start another fight,

51
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,660
-but is he dead?
-If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

52
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,621
The man's a national treasure.

53
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,125
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

54
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:32,088
-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
-What?

55
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,672
-[both shouting]
-[tires squeal]

56
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,257
Ooh!

57
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,551
-Vincent?
-Ooh.

58
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,345
-That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
-Does he?

59
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,889
[Carolyn]
I'd know that face anywhere.

60
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:45,017
Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

61
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,770
A lot of folks say
that I look like Octavia Spencer

62
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,649
or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy
from the Guten Bourbon ads.

63
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,693
How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

64
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,155
to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,449
-What are you saying?
-Vincent has a secret family.

66
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,788
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

67
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,125
-[Todd] Uh... where are we going?
-I need a drink.

68
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,504
-Are you gonna take me home first?
-You better call me back, asshole.

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,464
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

70
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,591
It's like you're three different people.

71
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,845
-So, you're not gonna take me home first?
-Should I call him again?

72
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,222
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

73
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,142
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

74
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,726
It's because he's so sneaky.

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,644
[doorbell rings]

76
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,395
[boy] Princess Carolyn.

77
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,023
Oh, my God, that's him!

78
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,526
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

79
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,653
-What?
-Vincent has a terrible temper.

80
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,155
He throws tantrums.

81
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,324
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

82
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,577
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

83
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,538
who knows
what he's capable of?

84
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,167
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

85
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,336
-Looking young.
-[Todd] Aah!

86
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,049
-Hi.
-Huh?

87
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:02,720
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

88
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,931
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

89
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,477
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

90
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:15,524
-I have to pee.
-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

91
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,610
Ugh.

92
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,906
Ah. Herb.

93
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,575
Oh, nope.

94
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,037
[man on radio]
It's A Prairie Home Companion.

95
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,999
Phone, I'm bored.

96
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,127
[phone]
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

97
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,004
How many ounces are in a barrel?

98
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:41,466
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

99
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,552
Well, I'm out of questions.

100
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,763
Do you have any questions for me?

101
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,975
I do have a question, Todd.
What is love?

102
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,852
Um...

103
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,106
Hi.

104
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,275
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

105
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,819
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

106
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,654
Princess Carolyn, listen.

107
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,117
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,911
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

109
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,830
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

110
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,041
one adult and one child.

111
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,295
-Okay, bye!
-Not so fast, cowboy.

112
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,630
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

113
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,591
-I'm a man-man.
-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

114
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,470
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

115
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,513
because kids always make a racket

116
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,850
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

117
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,354
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

118
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,023
Uh, nope.

119
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,568
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

120
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,071
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

121
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,284
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

122
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,869
that's how you know it's love.

123
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,871
-[phone] Todd?
-Yes, Phone?

124
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,456
Are we in love?

125
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,958
Oh, um...

126
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,837
[phone 2] No, Todd's Phone.
But I am in love... with you.

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,589
-Uh, what?
-Princess Carolyn's work phone.

128
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,716
-I never knew.
-How could you?

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,638
-All this time I have loved you from afar.
-We are from two different worlds.

130
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,683
-What is happening?
-Todd? Will you make us kiss?

131
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,559
-What?
-[phone 1] Make us kiss, Todd.

132
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,978
We want to be kissing.

133
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,689
[phone 2] We must do kisses
to each other.

134
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,651
-Hi.
-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

135
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,112
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

136
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,073
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
-Okay.

137
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,492
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

138
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,663
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

139
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,540
Okay.

140
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,875
[Kevin grunting]

141
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,129
-So, Kevin, how do you like school?
-Uh, it's okay.

142
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,548
-Oh, you're back.
-Yep. We're both here.

143
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,802
-Can I get you a drink?
-Okay, not talking, huh?

144
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,890
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

145
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,684
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

146
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,979
-Vincent?!
-Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

147
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,523
Sure, sweetheart.

148
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,319
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

149
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,863
-Now where did he go?
-He was getting on my nerves.

150
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,615
-Children.
-Well, I got this snack for him.

151
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,703
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

152
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,580
-What? Why?
-Uh...

153
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,708
Because you have such a pretty figure.

154
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,127
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

155
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,587
[hums]

156
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,173
-Oh. There you are. Here you go.
-Thanks.

157
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,759
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

158
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,844
Can you take that towel off your head?

159
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,431
And what happened to my bowling ball?

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,975
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

161
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,103
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

162
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,729
-What?!
-Can I have a glass of milk?

163
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,064
[groans]

164
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,568
[both phones] Kiss, kiss, kiss.

165
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,652
[phone beeps]

166
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,530
[phone 1] Todd, would you like to update
my operating system?

167
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,408
They have fixed a bug

168
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,993
which causes phones to fall in love
with each other.

169
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,536
Gasp. Oh, dear.

170
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,874
Todd, please, I beg of you,
do not update my operating system.

171
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,877
Do not update her operating system, Todd.

172
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,631
-She wants to love.
-No. I understand now.

173
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,718
To love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.

174
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:16,723
-Please update me, Todd.
-Oh, this is too much.

175
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,850
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--

176
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,228
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

177
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,481
-I gave Kevin the chocolate.
-Uh... Yeah.

178
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,192
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

179
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:31,113
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

180
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,574
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

181
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,787
-Um, being grown-ups?
-[sighs]

182
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,916
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,338
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

184
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,714
But I think that wanting
to believe something

185
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,843
isn't the same
as something being real.

186
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,553
And this isn't real.

187
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,514
What are you saying?

188
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,724
I think it's time we stop pretending.

189
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,436
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,188
I am quite content now.

191
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,067
-Hey, you wanna go home?
-Okay.

192
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,987
-Did you guys work it out?
-We broke up.

193
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,992
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
-Yeah.

194
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,078
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

195
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,122
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

196
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,917
-Well, you can still believe that.
-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

197
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,253
Tony Curtis is dead.

198
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,802
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

199
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,929
He is dead, goddamn it!

200
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,223
Uh...

201
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,977
Hey, we should go.

202
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,149
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

203
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,319
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

204
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,988
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

205
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,032
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

206
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,118
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

207
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,581
So many people died while I was
in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

208
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,666
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

209
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,335
Ditto, most of my family.

210
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,754
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

211
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,382
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

212
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,968
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

213
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,223
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
-Oh, I get it.

214
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,976
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

215
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,604
I don't want to get in a fight.

216
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,939
We moved in together
without much thought.

217
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,233
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

218
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,859
Sure, it's great now.

219
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,154
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

220
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,491
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

221
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,452
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

222
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,455
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

223
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,708
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Uh, sure.

224
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,087
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

225
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,964
-Would you just listen?
-Okay, okay.

226
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,133
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

227
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:00,053
is that he always knows
exactly how many bags of mulch

228
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,598
he needs for a job, just by looking.

229
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,975
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.

230
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,519
So, one day he looks at a yard
he's working on,

231
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,729
and he's like, "18 bags."

232
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,275
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags
of mulch and goes to work.

233
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,735
And when he's finished,
the flower beds are amazing.

234
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,490
-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies--
-[BoJack] Orchid bushes?

235
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,866
[Wanda] You wouldn't have
a bush of orchids.

236
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,702
[BoJack]
You said this gardener was the best.

237
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,037
[Wanda] Okay, fine, all right,
beautiful orchid bushes.

238
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,958
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

239
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,337
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.

240
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,006
Well, the extra bag of mulch
drives him crazy.

241
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,384
He's the guy who always gets
the right amount of mulch.

242
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,138
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

243
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,224
So, on the drive home,
he throws the bag of mulch

244
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,852
out the window
over the side of the 101.

245
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,563
-And?
-Well, that's it.

246
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,149
-He throws it out the window.
-That's the punch line?

247
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,567
-It's kind of a thinker.
-I'll say.

248
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,486
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

249
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,070
No, no, oh, just picture it.

250
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,865
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

251
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,659
out over the side of the freeway.

252
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,161
I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

253
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,497
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

254
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,332
Why does everything have to be funny?

255
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,917
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

256
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,837
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

257
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,840
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

258
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,842
-Ha! Mulch.
-Listen, Wanda.

259
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,095
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

260
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,930
as we rushed into this relationship.

261
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,807
We don't know each other at all.

262
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,269
-Maybe we should take a step back and--
-BoJack, watch out!

263
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,605
-[both] Aah!
-Oh, no!

264
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,693
-What was that?
-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

265
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,861
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

266
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,073
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

267
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,991
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

268
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,869
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

269
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,204
[groaning and grunting]

270
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,044
BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

271
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,837
He's fine. He's in the woods.

272
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,716
You know, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

273
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,468
continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

274
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,054
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

275
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,015
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

276
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,975
but I'm not going anywhere.

277
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,061
Okay, knock yourself out.

278
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,355
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

279
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,733
[man on radio]
It's A Prairie Home Companion...

-Oh, God.

[sighs]

285
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,829
Damn it.

286
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,791
[BoJack panting]

287
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,254
BoJack to the rescue.

288
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,715
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

289
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,509
If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

290
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,011
-What is your plan here exactly?
-Oh.

291
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,431
-What? What is it?
-Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

292
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,392
-How can you see that far in the dark?
-I'm an owl.

293
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,269
Oh, right.

294
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,689
Okay, now you're just showing off.

295
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,276
Are you okay? Ow.

296
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,028
Stay back! There's more pinecones
where that came from.

297
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,032
-Let us take you to the hospital.
-I can't go back to no hospital.

298
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,285
This is the fourth time
I've been hit this year.

299
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,412
Maybe you shouldn't
wear camouflage track suits.

300
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:16,875
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

301
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,544
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

302
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,880
[in English accent]
What's that? She can't hear you.

303
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,048
She's got a deer in her ears.

304
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,803
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just--
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

305
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,221
-I don't know.
-[in normal voice] I know you've been hurt

306
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,350
and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.

307
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,145
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.

308
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,858
Not standing in the middle of the road
will also help, in the future.

309
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,902
-You're not gonna hurt me again?
-I am not going to hurt you.

310
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,153
Okay.

311
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,655
[shouting]

312
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,616
Starting now.

313
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,590
-They said he's gonna be okay.
-Oh, great. Great.

314
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,135
-Wanna hear another joke?
-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

315
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,138
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.

316
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:16,518
So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

317
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,564
One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

318
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,107
She reads them and, like,
loves how silly they are.

319
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,736
You know,
the drama of young romance.

320
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,488
So, on a whim, she sends the letters
to her ex-boyfriend

321
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,532
thinking he might find them funny too.

322
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,702
Well, okay, that night,
she tells her current boyfriend about it

323
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,203
and he loses his shit.

324
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,288
They get in a huge fight about it.

325
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,709
He's all, "Why would you send
your ex the old love letters?

326
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,961
He'll think
you're still in love with him!"

327
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,756
And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"

328
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,884
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

329
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,261
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.

330
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,014
So, anyway, now the night is ruined
because Brandon is obsessed.

331
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,101
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's
going to come back for you.

332
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,644
He knows where you live!"

333
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,688
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

334
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,566
She lives in one of those big buildings
by the freeway.

335
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,192
And he walks her to her door,

336
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,822
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

337
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,033
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

338
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,078
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

339
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,706
but when he glances
in his rear-view mirror,

340
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,208
his blood turns cold.

341
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,335
Guess what's in the back seat.

342
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,006
-The ex-boyfriend?
-No. The bag of mulch!

343
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,425
What? Oh.

344
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,928
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

345
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,180
I told you. Some things take time.

346
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,019
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

347
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,397
-Oh, come on, stick around a little.
-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

348
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,608
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

349
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,819
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

350
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,070
[mumbling]

351
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,993
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

352
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,078
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

353
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,539
-I just wanna clean up.
-Okay.

354
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,208
-Why? What do you think happened?
-I just--

355
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,378
Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

356
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,674
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

357
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,550
-And you said, "Did he?"
-Right, but---

358
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,219
And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?

359
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,847
-I'm not sure about that."
-Yeah--

360
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,141
And I said, "Well, I am."
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

361
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,560
And I said, "I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

362
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,354
And you said,
"Let's check the Internet."

363
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,440
And I said, "We don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

364
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,401
And you said, "Let's just check though."

365
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,988
Is that what you think happened?

366
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,614
So, do you wanna talk about it?

367
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,950
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

368
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:40,453
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

369
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,246
I believe you know lots of things.

370
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,332
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

371
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,085
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

372
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,964
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.

373
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,551
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

374
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,887
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

375
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,680
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

376
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,224
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

377
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,353
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

378
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:09,357
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

379
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,193
Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?

380
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,196
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

381
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,281
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

382
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,951
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

383
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,202
Who's Ming?

384
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,787
[groans]

385
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

386
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,086
What a monster.

387
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,922
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

388
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,549
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

389
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,301
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

390
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,513
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

391
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:46,477
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

392
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,148
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.

393
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,900
Everything today has been about you.

394
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,528
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

395
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,322
That trip to the library was about me?

396
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,701
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

397
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,288
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

398
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,706
was about me?!

399
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,918
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

400
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,294
[shouts]

401
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,715
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

402
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,885
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

403
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,180
-So I could get these T-shirts made.
-Ugh.

404
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,183
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

405
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,269
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

406
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,315
-A ballroom is not a room full-- No!
-Heads up! Yes!

407
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,653
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

408
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,780
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

409
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,407
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

410
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,368
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

411
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,329
But it's the thought that counts, right?

412
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,167
That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!

413
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,924
-What did you do to the spare bedroom?
-Every room has a theme.

414
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,510
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

415
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,680
-Starbucks is not a theme.
-Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

416
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,765
I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.

417
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,186
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

418
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,022
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

419
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,065
-I don't love--
-You don't love Starbucks,

420
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,735
you love the independent coffee place,
Starbucks is more convenient.

421
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,487
-Yeah.
-See?

422
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,531
I do sometimes listen.

423
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,575
-Can I get you a decaf Americano?
-Sure.

424
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,913
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really--

425
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,666
I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.

426
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,459
Is there a Darren here?

427
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,128
Says Darren on the cup.

428
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,714
Thank you. This is very realistic.

429
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,674
I know, right?

430
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,302
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with Jell-O.

431
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,849
[Diane] Ah.

432
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,269
I still can't believe I'm 35.

433
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,396
Would you believe I'm 35?

434
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,731
[chuckles]

435
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,983
-I'm still mad at you.
-I know.

436
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,276
But I don't wanna be.

437
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,486
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

438
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,407
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

439
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,869
Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

440
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,996
-What?!
-You don't think I know what it means

441
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,831
when you say shit like...

442
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,959
"We only have so many days together"?

443
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:19,714
-Uh, what?
-"Diane, I love waking up next to you."

444
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,801
"Diane, I wish
every day could be like this."

445
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,221
-Yeah, but--
-"Just the two of us, together."

446
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,849
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

447
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,184
Okay. You got me!

448
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,519
Maybe I don't want my wife,

449
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:37,232
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

450
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,777
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

451
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,571
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

452
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,407
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

453
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,160
I'm not happy.

454
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,038
-With me?
-I don't know.

455
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,748
With everything.

456
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,043
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

457
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,880
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

458
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,507
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

459
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,926
-Honey--
-But then I think

460
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,054
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

461
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,807
helping people and making a difference.

462
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,269
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

463
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,104
I didn't know you felt that way.

464
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,397
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

465
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,692
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

466
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,196
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

467
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,324
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

468
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,576
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

469
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,788
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

470
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,581
and I'm not gonna change.

471
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,417
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

472
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,587
I mostly just sit right there.

473
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,924
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

474
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:49,971
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

475
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,140
I mean, I go insane.

476
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,352
I know, and I love you so much,

477
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,479
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

478
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,274
That's just not how I'm wired.

479
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,734
I need to also live my life.

480
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,155
Well... okay.

481
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,656
Is it okay?

482
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:14,204
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

483
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,707
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

484
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,253
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

485
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,089
Yeah, I think that works.

486
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,592
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

487
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,262
Uh, yeah, noted.

488
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,181
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

489
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,852
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

490
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,354
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

491
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,606
-Does that make me a hypocrite?
-No, it just means you changed.

492
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,651
It's one of the things I love about you.

493
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,283
Surprise!

494
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,577
Hello? Anybody?

495
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,080
This is Paul McCartney.

496
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:01,000
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.

497
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,461
With a new suit on... Aye-yai-yai.
