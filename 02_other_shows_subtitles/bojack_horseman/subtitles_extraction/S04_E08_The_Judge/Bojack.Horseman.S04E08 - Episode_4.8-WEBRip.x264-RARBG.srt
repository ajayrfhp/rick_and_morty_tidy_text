00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,928
So I send in the form,
and if my mom wants to meet me too,

2
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:16,221
- then we meet?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:17,704
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

4
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:21,142
then I get to feel that hot sting
of rejection all over again.

5
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:23,228
What a fun adventure this all is.

6
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:27,565
You know what is fun? You coming with me
to my first day on my new show.

I think it's one of those shows
about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?

00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,871
And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."

12
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,873
I'm just excited to get out of the house.

13
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:46,376
I've been getting really fidgety
cooped up on that hill.

14
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,179
Like I got tiny little bumps
crawling around

15
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:49,671
on the inside of my skin, you know?

16
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:53,355
Totally. Look at this guy,
texting in the middle of the intersection.

17
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:56,003
You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.

I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.

Boom!

20
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,262
You got "judged."

21
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:06,263
It feels good
to be a dramatic actor again.

22
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:08,140
To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,

23
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:11,560
but to make someone cry, on purpose,
that is a precious gift.

- It's Miles, and I'm an intern.

It's about hope, and freedom,
and powerful lobbyists

who pay me to elect
a governor I can control

138
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,181
so we can get legislation passed
that allows them to build private prisons

on what are now protected wetlands.

140

can find some other puppet

Tweeds, Nantucket, and Loophole!

154
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:14,256
Ugh.

155
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,383
It's so wonderful to meet you all!

156
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,635
- Can I get you a cocktail?
- Oh. No, thank you.

157
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:19,803
- Wine?
- That's all right.

158
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:23,181
I will consider it a personal affront
if you won't at least have a beer.

159
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:25,392
- I shouldn't.
- What about a very caffeinated coffee?

160
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,476
- No.
- Raw shellfish?

161
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,728
- Not tonight.
- Cigarette?

162
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,062
- I don't smoke.
- That's okay.

163
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,939
You can just stand around me
while I smoke.

164
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:31,857
No, I don't want to.

165
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,774
Cocaine, then?

166
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,860
I so appreciate that,
and I hate to be rude,

167
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,695
but I really don't think it's a good idea.

168
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,947
Would you like me to punch you
in the belly real quick

169
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,033
so you remember
what it's like to be alive?

170
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,492
That's a rich person thing.

171
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:44,411
Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.

172
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:47,539
But I'm actually good,
as far as belly-punchings go.

173
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,245
Well, can I at least offer you a ride
on our private rollercoaster?

174
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,669
Surely, there's no reason
you wouldn't want to do that.

175
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,838
- So if you decline, I will be offended.
- Oh.

176
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,298
Also, not that it's relevant,

177
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:58,425
but the rollercoaster
is specifically discouraged

178
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:00,260
for children under five
and pregnant women.

179
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,970
But since you are neither of those,

180
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:04,181
obviously, there's no reason
you will not want to ride

181
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:06,600
on our family's really fun rollercoaster.

182
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,977
- Okay, look, the truth is...
- Hey, Dad!

183
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:11,855
Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn
one of your great golf stories?

184
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,523
- Say, there's an idea.
- Yes!

185
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,985
So here I am with a mashie
when what I need is a niblick.

186
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,570
[all laughing]

187
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,448
Wow, golf. Fore! Am I right?

188
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,409
Yes, that's exactly right. Golf.

189
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:25,952
[camera shutters clicking]

190
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,123
Californians, this is an endorsement!

191
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,541
My message is simple.

192
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,462
If you want to vote Peanutbutter,
vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz

193
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:38,840
because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz
is a vote for Peanutbutter.

194
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:39,758
Uh...

195
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,677
Since Peanutbutter
likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

196
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,640
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,
vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...

197
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:49,476
- Excuse me...
- for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

198
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,021
So if we want to vote for Woodchuck,
we should vote for you?

199
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:53,939
- No.
- Yes.

200
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,316
- By voting for Woodchuck.
- Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

201
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,110
I look forward to moving past

202
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,362
the political divisiveness
of this campaign

203
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,989
and finally focusing on the issues.

204
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,366
What's with the gorilla feet?

205
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:05,826
[sighs]

206
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:06,952
As I've explained before,

207
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,121
my hands were crushed
during the fracking incident.

208
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,373
There were no hand transplants
readily available,

209
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,875
but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.

210
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,961
So I am using them temporarily

211
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:19,506
while my doctors
find me more suitable replacements.

212
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,300
[laughs]
They sure made a monkey out of you, huh?

213
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:24,089
- [reporters laugh]
- They did no such thing.

214
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,137
Gorillas are apes.

215
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,430
I feel that went pretty well.

216
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:29,141
Yes, well, thank you
for dropping out of the race.

217
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:33,103
Rest assured, under my stewardship,
the state will be in good...

218
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,480
- You were gonna say "hands," weren't you?
- Ugh.

219
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:37,649
So, what's next for us two amigos?

220
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,694
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we don't need your help on the campaign.

221
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:43,864
We are running virtually unopposed.
I think our team can handle it from here.

222
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,073
Wha-wha-wha-what?

223
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:48,660
The best way you can help us
is to go back to your regular life

224
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:51,079
and stay out of politics forever.

225
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:55,917
So this chapter of my life is over?
Doggy, doggy. What now?

226
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,627
Coochy-coochy-coochy...

227
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,463
Hey, Mom.
You got something in the mail.

228
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:02,674
Have I received
any gentleman callers today?

229
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:05,844
I'm expecting a visit
from Corbin Creamerman.

230
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:07,095
You know what? I'll check.

231
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,931
You could learn a thing or two
from him, Henrietta!

232
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,015
Mm-hmm.

233
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,977
- Hey, where have you been?
- I'll make coffee.

234
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,395
Oh, uh...

235
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,106
well, Miles actually took me
to check out UCLA.

236
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,775
He took me to a party,
and I got to sleep in a dorm room, and...

237
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:23,278
Wow, look at the time.
That's enough questioning of me,

238
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,780
and where I've been,
and what I've been doing. See ya later!

239
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,908
Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night?

240
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,368
BoJack! We didn't just hook up.

241
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:32,329
Miles is a really interesting soul,

242
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,789
- and I feel like we connected.
- Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.

243
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:37,501
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear
from that guy again.

244
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:38,835
Okay, actually, I am,

245
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,962
because when I left his dorm
he said he would,

246
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,215
and I quote, "Definitely text me."

247
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:44,799
Oh, wow, I didn't realize.

248
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,510
Should we plan the wedding for you

249
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,387
and teenage-boy-you-slept-with
who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?

250
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,472
Very funny.

251
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:52,724
Believe me, I take no pleasure
in telling you this,

252
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:55,644
- but that kid is never, ever, ever...
- [phone chimes]

253
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:58,480
- Ooh! BoJack...
- Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.

254
00:10:58,563 --> 00:10:59,523
Now, where was I?

255
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:03,401
Right. You'll never ever
hear from this guy again.

256
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:04,486
- But, I...
- Ba-ba-ba!

257
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:07,697
In fact, if he texts you,
I will do a hundred pushups.

258
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:11,326
That's how sure I am,
since there is no possible way...

259
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,662
"Had a great time last night. Kilometers."

260
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:14,579
"Kilometers"?

261
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,957
It's an inside joke between me and Miles.

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.

263
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:22,003
- [phone chimes]
- He wants to take me to a party tonight.

264
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,922
- Shouldn't you be doing pushups?
- [sighs]

265
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:26,508
Nope, can't. Impossible.

266
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,301
Anyone who says
they did a pushup is lying.

267
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:30,381
- [phone chimes]
- That him canceling? Classic move.

268
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,389
No, he wants to spend the day together.

269
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,391
Oh. Well, you wanna
have breakfast first?

270
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:36,393
I got a box of crullers,
of which one remains.

271
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,894
Nah, I'm good with this coffee.

272
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:39,771
I'll be home for dinner, though. Bye!

273
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,606
Okay.

274
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,985
Forty-six, 47...

275
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:48,697
- Ah! I could do this all day.
- [groans]

276
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,158
- [horn honking]
- [gasps, whimpers]

277
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,914
We have gathered in Todd's new apartment
to discuss the future of PB Livin'.

278
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,499
You told me this was an intervention

279
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,002
to get Todd to stop coming up
with awful ideas.

280
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:03,878
That was a pretense
to get you to show up.

281
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,672
- What?
- It was Todd's idea.

282
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:06,965
What else you got, Todd?

283
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:11,011
Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

284
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:13,305
- You bite your tongue.
- Yes, bite it all the way off!

285
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:15,849
All your ideas are beyond terrible.

286
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:19,227
Well, in that case, I guess I must have
"terrible" business instincts.

287
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:20,854
- You do!
- Because I wanna hear it.

288
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,149
They say "the devil's in the details,"
so let's summon the devil!

289
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,900
Okay, so you know how hard it is

290
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,528
- to get your kids to go to the dentist?
- I don't.

291
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:31,573
But what if dentists
had a friendlier face?

292
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:32,866
Ooh!

293
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,493
What if you could take your kids
to a dentist's office

294
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:37,954
where all the dentists were clowns?

295
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,123
- What?!
- Kids love clowns!

296
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,000
- Do kids love clowns?
- Actually...

297
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,836
Don't they?
Who else would clowns be for?

298
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,796
Because adults don't love clowns.

299
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,632
That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

300
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:52,344
So kids must love clowns,

301
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:54,929
because otherwise,
why would there be clowns?

302
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:56,306
That is sound logic. Okay.

303
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,017
I want these clown dentists
laughing maniacally

304
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,687
as they drill into the teeth
of America's children, starting yesterday!

305
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:06,024
As someone who does have children,
I have to say,

306
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:09,527
a lot of kids
are actually terrified of clowns!

307
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:10,612
Are they? Hm.

308
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:13,239
That would have been helpful information
before I committed.

309
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,451
But my word is my bond
and I already said yes, didn't I?

310
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,621
Okay, so do we find dentists
and train them to be clowns,

311
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:22,165
or do we get clowns
and train them to be dentists?

312
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:25,752
Why don't we get clowns and dentists
and they can train each other?

- And this is for you.
- I want those.

323

See, the feast is about remembering

324

the ancient tale of a heroic mouse
named Squeaky.

325

And we always start by wearing cat ears
and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy,

I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

How about just as a general rule,
don't ever call a woman a blob?

Never! What if I meet a woman
whose name is Barbara Lob?

396
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:05,263
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."

Maybe instead of figuring out
the woman blob workaround,

398
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,851
you should just tell Hollyhock
you're sorry.

I still think Miles is up to something.

Why is it so hard for you to believe

401
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,231
someone could genuinely
like your daughter?

402
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,066
Because she's like me!

403
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,572
Okay. Do you think maybe this could be
more about you than it is about her?

404
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,742
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work
to do on myself. Everyone knows that.

405
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,745
But the important thing right now
is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.

406
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,455
Try to stay on topic, Diane.

407
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,874
Well, an open conversation
about your concerns with...

No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.

409
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:36,878
Then why do you want my advice?

410
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:40,048
I got it. If I can somehow prove to her
what a jerk Miles is,

411
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:42,216
then she'll have to like me more
by default.

412
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,509
That's the BoJack way.

Goldie, how would you like
to advance to the final round?

I would do anything, and I mean, anything.

417
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:59,108
- So I did it. I had sex with the PA.
- You had sex with him?

That's what you wanted, right?

419
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,862
I just said "seduce" the PA.

420
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,572
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?

421
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:08,242
No, I just wanted you to,
like, get him all hot and bothered.

- Eh...?
- And ready to sleep with you.

Then once you get him on audiotape

- saying that he would sleep with you...
- What?

Come up with some excuse to get
out of there with virtue intact.

426
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,504
That's a lot of specifics
you just assumed I would know.

427
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,715
Okay, well, the important thing is,
we got him now.

Tell Miles what you told me.

429
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,303
- I had sex with the PA.
- What PA?

430
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:30,515
I think his name was "Eggberg"?

431
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,558
- What? Not him?
- That's the intern.

432
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,687
- You said "PA."
- Did you think I was a PA? Nice!

433
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,271
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?

434
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,356
Not sleep with.

435
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:42,652
You told a contestant
you would advance her to the final round

436
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,153
if she slept with a PA?

437
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:46,531
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.

438
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,158
We make a show about empowering women
and lifting them up,

439
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:52,161
and you cheapen it
with this coarse vulgarity.

440
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:54,497
I cannot lie. You disgust me.

441
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,082
This was all a big misunderstanding.

Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.

443

You're not fit to judge
anyone's character, or their booties.

444
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:06,300
So it is about judging booties.

Don't want me dating your daughter,

I'm sorry.

Maybe we could've worked out
some sort of deal.

450
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,185
What do you mean?

451
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,272
All right, so I got this screenplay,
and I think it's a really fresh area.

452
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,899
It's about a production intern
who wants to be a writer.

453
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,984
Oh, wow.

454
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,903
I think it could go somewhere
if it got in front of the right person.

455
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,467
So if you have like an agent
or a manager you could give it to,

456
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,701
that would be awesome,
and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.

457
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:32,785
I promise.

458
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,791
So you were right. He was a dirtbag.

459
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,711
Yeah. I was kinda hoping
I was wrong for once.

460
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,129
If it makes you feel any better,

461
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:45,339
you were wrong
about all the other parts of this.

462
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:48,342
Diane, you are so bad
at making people feel better.

463
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,719
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?

464
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:52,430
She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.

465
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,429
But for now, if she believes someone
can love her for who she really is,

466
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,076
then why would I take that
away from her?

467
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:02,356
BoJack, you gotta get
one of these massages.

468
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,983
- Oh-hh!
- Okay.

469
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:07,111
- [Mimi] Goodbye, darling.
- [Sissy] It was good seeing you.

470
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:10,364
- It was so much fun seeing you both.
- Thank you for hosting us.

471
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:12,116
It was so nice to get away for the week

472
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,202
and learn all about
your charming little traditions

473
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:16,037
that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!

474
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,873
Did our little city mouse
have a nice time in the country?

475
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:19,957
Everything was wonderful.

476
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,503
And your little companion was darling...
For a week.

477
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:26,297
But I do hope the next one you bring home
knows how to appreciate

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,299
a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.

479
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:29,842
Well, for your information,

480
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,886
there's not gonna be a "next one,"
because...

481
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,556
I love Princess Carolyn and we're having
a baby and I couldn't be happier!

482
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,974
[Mimi] Oh, my God.

483
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:43,022
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.

484
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:45,274
I didn't realize
how much tension I'd built up in my...

485
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,903
Oh, my God! Um...

486
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:53,866
Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room
filled with dentist clowns?

487
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,785
Don't be ridiculous, Diane.

488
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,662
They're not all dentist clowns.

489
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:59,539
Half of them are clown dentists.

490
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,833
Just try to ignore them
and go about your business.

491
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,793
- Okay.
- So, this is the incisor.

492
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,628
Doc, if this is what's incisor,

493
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,381
I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!

[Tom Jumbo-Grumbo] With former rival
Mr. Peanutbutter's support,

497
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,889
just yesterday,
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

498
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,224
seemed to be unbeatable,

499
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:23,187
but as a new candidate enters the race,
is Woodchuck also "unbeata-Biel"?

500
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,438
"UnbeataBiel"?

501
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:28,776
Randy, you wily son of a...
I've missed you, buddy! Bring it in!

502
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,028
"UnbeataBiel"?
[gasps]

503
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,447
I'm tired of these politicians
who are all talk.

504
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:36,868
California needs a leader
who excels in both comedy and drama

505
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:39,370
and who is beautiful
in an approachable girl-next-door way,

506
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,539
and who will get all the criminals
off the street

507
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,167
while simultaneously finding a use
for our wetlands.

508
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,793
That's why I'm running for governor.

509
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:48,504
A candidate you can Jessica-lieve in.

510
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:49,505
What the...?!

511
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,299
Let's do it together! I'm with me!

512
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:52,967
Oh-hh! Katrina.

513
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,012
- Gadzooks!
- Not now, Professor Flim-Flam!

514
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,972
Of course,
Katrina would latch onto Jessica

515
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,183
as the beautiful face
of her dangerous agenda.

516
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:03,269
Well, there's no way
they could beat Woodchuck, right?

517
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,188
No? Because I almost beat him

518
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:07,023
and I don't even know
what a governor does.

519
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:10,276
That's true.
Mr. Peanutbutter, you've got to help.

520
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,195
Woodchuck has no idea
what he's up against.

521
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:14,947
You're right! But are we sure
this is the right thing for us?

522
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:17,945
If I jump right back into politics,
that's not gonna give me a lot of time

523
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:20,369
to focus on our burgeoning
clown dentistry business.

Then it is definitely
the right thing for us.

533
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,932
We come with a message
from Mr. Peanutbutter.

534
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,892
You can tell Mr. Peanutbutter I don't...

535
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,186
- Ha! Woodchuck!
- What do you want?

00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,354
You need me, Woodchuck!

537
00:22:46,437 --> 00:22:49,440
You've got brain smarts,
but your sober-minded policy speeches

538
00:22:49,523 --> 00:22:52,860
are no match for the glitz and pizzazz
of a Hollywoo starlet.

Even a relatively low-wattage one
like Jessica Biel.

540
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:57,949
He's right. California loves making
movie stars governors.

541
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:00,159
I was married to both Jessica and Katrina.

542
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,786
I know them inside and out.

543
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,748
And I'm not speaking in a sexual way,
although it is also true in a sexual way.
