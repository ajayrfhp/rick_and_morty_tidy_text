00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,850
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing
Tale from the Above Ground. Who's next?

156
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,852
I can't take this anymore.
I need to get out.

157
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:44,979
This is the longest I've gone
without moisturizing,

158
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,689
- and I feel like a lizard!
- Humph.

159
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,816
- No offense.
- It's only been 72 hours.

160
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,195
I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.
I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

161
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:54,572
I can't live like this!
We've gotta light someone on fire.

162
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:58,284
I'm starting to think that less-famous
Michelle Monaghan has the right idea

163
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,203
- about lighting people on fire.
- Thank you.

164
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:03,581
Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here...

165
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:05,416
To raise money for my campaign,

166
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,878
and more recently, to not go crazy
and murder each other.

167
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:13,841
Can someone please bring me my car?
It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

168
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,676
You're killing me, Zach.

169
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,054
[sighs]
Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

170
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,139
Be the leader that I know you can be.

171
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,683
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

172
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,987
- [bangs]
- What in the world?

173
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,647
"Vox clamantis in deserto."

174
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,149
- It is I.
- Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz!

175
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,359
- We're saved!
- Wow!

176
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:32,568
Oh, thank God. A leader.

177
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,852
- [Diane laughs]
- [BoJack] Sh.

178
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:36,703
What's going on down here?
Anyone's looking for us?

179
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,727
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

180
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:42,077
Diane, have you just been getting drunk
with BoJack this whole time?

181
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:45,071
- What? I'm still mad at you.
- [BoJack laughing]

182
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:47,916
- Citizens, remain calm.
- Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,502
Rescue workers are coming
but it could be a while.

184
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,464
State emergency funds have been depleted
due to budget overruns

185
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,698
on a costly bridge to Hawaii
that's being constructed.

186
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:57,798
Oh, yeah!

187
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,762
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,
I came to get you out early.

188
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:05,100
Is that what a woodchuck is?
Why did I think it was like a beaver?

189
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:07,704
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?

190
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,522
- Is the city in chaos?
- No, it's really just your house.

191
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:14,193
Because of all the fracking that's been
happening underneath your house.

192
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:16,653
Oh! Interesting!

193
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,197
- Ay-yi-yi.
- Oh, right, right.

194
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,160
So you just burrowed down here to rescue
your political opponent's top donors.

195
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,286
That's convenient.

196
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,371
It was actually very inconvenient,

197
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:30,459
but I put politics aside
to save you people from dying.

198
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,336
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

199
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:33,504
[all]
Hip, hip, hooray!

200
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:36,256
Please, don't cheer too loudly.
The tunnel is very delicate.

201
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,540
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Seriously, I think it's best to...

202
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,219
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- [rumbling]

203
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:43,555
[sighs]

204
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,600
- Let's cheer one more time, just for fun!
- No, please.

205
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,561
- Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

206
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,063
- No!
- [rumbling]

207
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,566
[screams]

208
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,530
So turns out three cheers was probably
an adequate number of cheers.

209
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,203
[rumbling]

210
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,080
- What was that?
- Just keep walking.

211
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:09,498
God, I can't wait to get home.

212
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,166
I don't even have a home anymore.

213
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,546
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all
my different colored hats I never wear?

214
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,507
Well, if you need another couch
to crash on, there's always my place.

215
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,386
- Didn't you move in with Ralph?
- Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

216
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:25,097
- Just in case, I guess.
- In case of what?

217
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,620
- [faint chattering]
- What was that?

218
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,308
Whoa!

219
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,060
Oh!

220
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,896
[yelps]

221
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,899
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.

222
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,068
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

223
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,069
[ants gasp]

224
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,862
[chattering]

225
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,324
Did you say you're a princess?

226
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,160
- That's just my name. I'm a manager.
- It's like an agent.

227
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,371
- It's totally different.
- Is it, though?

228
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:53,375
- Silence! You negotiate deals?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,629
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

230
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:58,922
[ant leader laughs]

231
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:04,469
My hands... they're crushed.

232
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,513
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

233
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:07,681
Well, I can dig!

234
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:09,808
Actually, no one should dig.

235
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:12,060
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.

236
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:15,522
The slightest provocation could cause
another collapse that would crush us all.

237
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:16,440
[all gasp]

238
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:20,235
I know that because I bought a sitcom
about fracking, The Frack Shack.

239
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,988
It's New Girl meets fracking.
[chuckles]

240
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,282
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch
that show, huh?

241
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,533
[groans]

242
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:30,245
Someone will be coming for us soon.
In the meantime, we must organize.

243
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,664
Parcel out food and water
and see how much we've got.

244
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:36,335
- I'll assign team leaders.
- Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

245
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,128
[groans]

246
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,673
[guests chuckling]

247
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,592
All right. Um...

248
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,303
- God...!
- For you, a banana

249
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:49,014
- because you're so appealing.
- Yeah.

250
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,016
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

251
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,809
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

252
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,271
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

253
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,398
- And who made you the food captain?
- Woodchuck.

254
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,567
Exactly. He's in charge.

255
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,487
Excuse me,
you have not been allocated those rations.

256
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,157
I'm a horse. I need more food,
and I'm a celebrity.

257
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,910
- Everyone down here is a celebrity.
- Not the caterers.

258
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,495
Relinquish the food.

259
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:12,996
Hey. Here's your chance.

260
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,835
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

261
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,963
This man has already reached
his allotted food portion for the day.

262
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,799
Who said we have to go by your rules?

263
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,259
Yeah, who made you leader
of underground?

264
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:27,969
I'm just gonna take all this and...

265
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,472
You've appointed me.
Yes, I under... citizens, look...

266
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,849
Keep it together.
[grunts]

267
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:36,269
- Weird stuff going on downstairs.
- [clicking]

268
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:37,521
Humph.

269
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:40,482
- I can't believe this is my life.
- Uh-oh.

270
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,068
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?

271
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:46,154
I'm trapped underground
and it's all my husband's fault

272
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:51,201
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

273
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,745
Okay. But on the bright side...

274
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,125
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,
you got a cool job, you got friends.

275
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,709
Jesus, you're right.

276
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:03,004
Even when I was above ground,
I wasn't satisfied.

277
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:06,174
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

278
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,386
[sobbing]

279
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,138
Whoa!

280
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,055
What the...?

281
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:16,476
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

282
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,853
No. It...

283
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:20,605
I am! I'm a pit.

284
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:24,484
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

285
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,902
Diane, you're not a pit.

286
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:29,030
I'm a pit!
[sobbing]

287
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:31,616
[sighs]

288
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,955
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.

289
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:39,791
It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

290
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,502
You disappeared for a year and a half.

291
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:45,422
So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.

292
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:48,758
If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?

293
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:52,345
- I wasn't... ready.
- Ready? For what?

294
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,973
I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.

295
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:58,059
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.

296
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,104
And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be

297
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:04,691
is still just some other version of me.

298
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:08,612
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.

299
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,697
I need you in my life.

300
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,408
- Really?
- You're the biggest asshole I know,

301
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,036
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.

302
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,371
[Diane sighs, moans]

303
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,877
People should be able to have
some control over their lives down here.

304
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,837
- Yeah!
- People need boundaries.

305
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,173
Leadership means
sometimes being the bad guy.

306
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:30,926
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

307
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,719
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

308
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,883
- That's not...
- That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

309
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,432
And I'm the good guy,
so that's two points for me.

310
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,017
What points? There are no points.

311
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,853
- This is not a game!
- Well, maybe there should be points.

312
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,146
- Yeah!
- Points!

313
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,775
People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.

314
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:49,694
Well, I'm the one who came down here
to save you in the first place.

315
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,279
Surely I get points for that.

316
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:54,533
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.

317
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:55,534
- He's right!
- What?!

318
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,744
If you came down to save us,
why are we still here?

319
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:58,787
[all] Yeah!

320
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,497
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

321
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,498
- Yeah!
- That's right.

322
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,791
Minus point for Woodchuck.

323
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:06,002
I implore you not to fall
into a mob mentality.

324
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,755
- He called us a mob! Let's kill him!
- Yeah!

325
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,467
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy
is as broken as his hands.

326
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:15,220
That is a convincing argument.
He does have broken hands.

327
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:18,557
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

328
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,602
An outsider like me,
the guy whose house this is.

329
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,188
[chanting]
Peanutbutter, Peanutbutter.

330
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,606
Peanutbutter... everybody.

331
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,067
[chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

332
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,151
Peanutbutter!

333
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,319
- Me!
- Peanutbutter!

334
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,737
- Me!
- Peanutbutter!

335
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,781
[faint chanting]
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter...

336
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,867
- [snoring]
- BoJack. BoJack.

337
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,034
- BoJack.
- What?

338
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:40,328
- Did you know I can juggle?
- Cool.

339
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:43,623
Are you okay?
I mean, outside of our current situation

340
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,792
of being buried alive
and almost out of alcohol

341
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,878
except for cooking sherry and Midori?

342
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,464
It's just been a rough couple years
with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

343
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,133
- And Corduroy?
- Cordu-what now?

344
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:58,263
Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson?
Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

345
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,849
Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

346
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,936
girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

347
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,188
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

348
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:09,566
- [clatters]
- Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

349
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,604
Supposed to help her figure out
who her mother is.

350
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:12,931
But I don't know where to start.

351
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:16,364
Did she try sending mutual consent form
to the adoption agency?

352
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,574
What, what words?

353
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:21,286
Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.

354
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,747
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

355
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,376
If Mom says same thing,
boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

356
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,004
- How do you know about that?
- I had an adopted brother.

357
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,298
And also for a while,
I hoped I was adopted.

358
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,300
- Ugh!
- Huh.

359
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:38,553
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

360
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:42,891
Who dares disturb Queen Antonia?

361
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,309
My name is Princess Carolyn.

362
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:47,395
I represent the soldiers
of Subcolony K-147,

363
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,732
who feel they're doing all the work
while reaping none of the spoils.

364
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:54,527
Everything my soldiers do
benefits the colony.

365
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,113
I had this same conversation
with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

366
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,199
Believe me, this doesn't end well
for you.

367
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,034
[sighs]
What are your demands?

368
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,619
[whispers]

369
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,121
They want to have sex with your drones.

370
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,040
My drones?

371
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:08,959
[dance music plays]

372
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,043
Mm-hmm.

373
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,379
Oliver, assemble the small council.

374
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:16,091
Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while,
can I get a new towel?

375
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:18,635
[guests chanting]

376
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:21,388
Woodchuck's aa-always telling us
what to do!

377
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,516
He says help is coming,
but how does he know? What if he's lying?

378
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,477
[wails]
And I have still not been validated!

379
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,062
If you could all be patient...

380
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:31,564
We're sick of waiting!
It's time for new leadership.

381
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,274
That attempted movie star is right!

382
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:37,404
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter
President-for-life of Underground.

383
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:38,321
[guests] Yeah!

384
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,864
[grunting]
Uh, uh, oh!

385
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:41,324
- Thank you!
- What? No!

386
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:44,035
- What do we do with Woodchuck?
- He must be made an example of.

387
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,203
- [man] Get him!
- Yeah!

388
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,288
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

389
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:50,583
We don't need to "get him."
Let's just tie him up someplace

390
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,003
where he can't hurt us anymore
with his dangerous ideas.

391
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:57,298
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.
No, don't... no...!

392
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:58,633
- [chanting] Peanutbutter!
- No!

393
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:01,261
- Peanutbutter!
- Thank you, thank you all.

394
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:05,306
As my first act as President-for-life,
I declare that everyone

395
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,226
is allowed to eat and drink
whatever they want!

396
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,686
[all] Yeah!

397
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,021
[crashing]

398
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:14,941
- [groans]
- [whimpers]

399
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,317
Agh...!

400
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:17,819
I'm starving,

401
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,447
and not the normal celebrity
kind of starving like I always am.

402
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,948
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

403
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,367
- Where's the food?
- [Woodchuck] You ate all the food.

404
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:26,661
This is it!

405
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:29,831
Nobody's coming for us.
We need to kill someone for food.

406
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,875
- Hmm...!
- Oh...!

407
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,334
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

408
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,670
He has the word "peanut butter"
in his name!

409
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:36,713
[all] Yeah!

410
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:40,175
Guys, guys, guys,
maybe we don't need to eat anybody!

411
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:41,760
- [all groan]
- What's this now?

412
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,845
Let's listen to the guy
who's saying don't kill me.

413
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,430
He's got some interesting ideas.

414
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:47,057
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

415
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,310
I'm known for monologues
that sum things up at the end of the show.

416
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:52,729
I drive a Prius,
which means I'm a good person.

417
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,565
Let's not surrender
to our basest instincts.

418
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,651
I know times are tough,
but I'm sure if we band together

419
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,904
and really concentrate
on the problem at hand,

420
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,156
we can, as a group of friends...
[screams]

421
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,993
- Oh, my God.
- Biel!

422
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:11,289
The rule of man is over.
Now begins the rule of fire.

423
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:14,000
- [howls] Oh, why?
- Jessica, no.

424
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,418
I will no longer be shackled

425
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,046
by the civilized society
of the above ground.

426
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,800
This is Underground,
and the only law here is flame.

427
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:25,845
The fire wants not for justice.
The fire wants not for reason.

428
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,599
- The fire desires only to be fed!
- Feed the fire!

429
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,811
- The fire is my new god!
- [moans] Oh, God!

430
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,647
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,
but the tide has turned

431
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,607
and I side with the fire now.

432
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,110
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.

433
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,113
- Tomorrow, canine cuisine!
- No.

434
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,156
You, take him to his spot,
and make him stay.

435
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,741
- [squawks]
- No! No! Please!

436
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:48,868
Listen to reason... this time!

437
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,996
[gulps] Ah-hh!

438
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,248
I think that's all of it.

439
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:56,459
I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.

440
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,878
Okay, okay.
Here's the secret to being happy.

441
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,630
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

442
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:04,551
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually
you'll forget you're pretending.

443
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:05,677
Maybe you're right.

444
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,721
I just need to stop complaining
and work harder.

445
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:11,474
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special?

446
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,309
- [door bangs]
- Lock him in here!

447
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:16,646
- Please! Diane, my sweet wife.
- What's going on?

448
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:17,564
Marvin Gaye.

449
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:20,150
The People of Underground
have a new god, the fire.

450
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,069
And for my crimes
I will be fed to its ravenous flames.

451
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,905
My only hope is the meat
of Zach Braff proves lasting,

452
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:28,825
but I fear by daybreak,
there will be no Braff meat left.

453
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,870
- What's going on?
- Four Non-Blondes.

454
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,329
Everybody out except the prisoner.

455
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:34,973
- [Diane] No!
- Easy on the merchandise!

456
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,040
Get off me!

457
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:40,962
Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,

458
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,132
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.

459
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:46,455
"The queen will share
male sex servants with the soldiers

460
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:48,553
for one night of magnificent,
sensuous splendor,

461
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,430
a gorgeous bacchanal
of hedonistic delights,

462
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:53,600
with a second orgy pickup option,
pursuant on success of the first."

463
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:54,809
[hissing]

464
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,895
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

465
00:20:56,978 --> 00:21:00,064
Great. Now can we please return
to the surface world?

466
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,609
All my favorite clouds are up there.

467
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:07,071
Oh, I like this one.
He's got moxie and a soft thorax.

468
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:11,576
How did you find your fleshy self
in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

469
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,120
We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.

470
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:17,540
There was an earthquake,
and now everyone's trapped underground.

471
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,627
Did you say Beverly Hills?
Ugh! Of course.

472
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,296
Surface dwellers are always moving in
on our territory.

473
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:26,216
First they move here, then taxes go up,

474
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,509
the next thing you know,
there's a Whole Foods.

475
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,845
How am I supposed to concentrate
on a great orgy

476
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:32,889
when I've got gentrification on my mind?

477
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,808
No, we've got to get
those interlopers out of here.

478
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,977
- Let's...
- Hey! Hold on.

479
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,943
- Uh...
- [Jessica] Mr. Peanutbutter,

480
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:48,404
did you or did you not tell us
we could eat whatever we wanted?

481
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,614
[all] Peanutbutter!

482
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:52,575
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!
Peanutbutter!

483
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:53,910
We gotta do something.

484
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,996
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me

485
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,831
and now they're gonna set him on fire.

486
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:01,417
Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.

487
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,336
I don't know. I need water.

488
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,922
There is no more water.
That's the problem.

489
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:06,839
"Choodwuck" is right.

490
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:11,427
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?
Like, a well?

491
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:15,890
- Yeah! And we're underground.
- If we dig, we'll get water!

492
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:20,103
- Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.
- Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

493
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,982
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

494
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:26,985
Any last words
before we light you on fire?

495
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:30,989
Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?

496
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:35,702
The fire bends to no man's will.
Nothing can defeat the fire. Only...

497
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:36,786
[Diane] Water!

498
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,038
[Jessica] What? [gasps]

499
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:42,500
- Oh, wow, it's really water.
- Water is stronger than fire.

500
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,794
Wait, let's not really forget how... ugh!

501
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:46,337
Water is my new god now!

502
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,297
Oh, boy.

503
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:50,341
- Clear gold!
- All right, water!

504
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:54,178
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

505
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:56,264
Hang on. It's... it's not stopping.

506
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:58,099
Which is great!

507
00:22:58,182 --> 00:23:00,184
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

508
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,978
H-2-Oh, no!

509
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:05,064
[guests whimpering]

510
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,234
Well, I guess this is it.

511
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:11,904
- [bangs]
- Oh, God! It's another earthquake!

512
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:13,906
[all screaming]

513
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,035
How is this happening?

514
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:20,705
[ants] Heave! Heave! Heave!

515
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,915
Get them out of here!

516
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,376
Okay.

517
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,212
No! Please! I'm important down here!

518
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,339
[guests]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

519
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:33,843
[crashes]

520
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:40,433
Oh, what an eyesore.
The HOA will be hearing about this.

521
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:47,774
We are never talking
about any of this ever again. Whew.

522
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,693
So I will see you tomorrow.
We've got a rally in Bakersfield

523
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:53,237
and then we're touring
a tennis ball factory in Modesto.

524
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:54,489
Okay.

525
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:57,158
- Hi.
- Hi.

526
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,160
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

527
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:01,287
- I don't tell you that enough.
- It's okay.

528
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:04,665
If this governor thing
is really important to you...

529
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,585
It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.

530
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:10,254
I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.

531
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:12,131
Well, I like you.

532
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,967
Come on, Diane, let's go home...

533
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,427
oh, right.

534
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:18,221
Well, thanks for inviting me
to your party.

535
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,182
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.

536
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:22,265
Sure.

537
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:28,189
- You guys hungry?
- I could eat.

538
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:30,983
- Ethiopian?
- Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

539
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,903
I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.

540
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,279
He's probably worried about me.

541
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:38,866
I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.

542
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,619
- What do they call it, "injera"?
- Yeah, injera.

543
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:44,233
- Injera, right.
- That's right.

544
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:46,663
Yeah, that's good bread.
