and try the borscht. Smooches!

153
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,011
- Hey...
- And that's how you do it, folks.

154
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,016
Oh... [gasps]

155
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,727
You're telling me
you didn't feel one twinge of guilt

156
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,520
when you left your mom in this place?

157
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:40,732
Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt,
trying to remember, no.

158
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:41,941
- Definitely not.
- Damn.

159
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,234
You didn't know my mom.

160
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:47,280
Football?
You don't have the haunches for it.

161
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,491
You'll only embarrass yourself,
as in every other endeavor you pursue.

162
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:53,036
- But, Mom...
- If you're looking to get knocked around

163
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,622
for an afternoon, why don't you just read
one of your father's manuscripts

164
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:59,167
and tell him his prose
is pedestrian and derivative?

165
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,501
Works for me every time.

166
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:02,420
[inhales and puffs]

167
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,675
Mrs. Horseman, you have a visitor.

168
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:10,720
Oh, uh...

169
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:13,264
- Hi, Mom.
- Do I know you?

170
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:16,225
Here we go.
Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.

171
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:18,436
- Henrietta?
- Okay, we're doing this?

172
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,480
I think she really doesn't know
who you are.

173
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:22,440
She knows.
This is just like when she pretended

174
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:25,610
not to recognize me
after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

175
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:27,653
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

176
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,073
who liked to tickle a lot more
than just the ivories.

177
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,743
When I made it home unscathed, she said,
"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

178
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:36,788
Henrietta, could I trouble you
for some orange juice, please?

179
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,111
Stop calling me Henrietta!
Nobody here's named Henrietta!

180
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,917
Henrietta, orange juice. Now!

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,835
You're not being paid
for polite conversation.

182
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,481
- BoJack, maybe you should just...
- Oh, hello! It's you.

183
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:46,547
Hollyhock.

184
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:51,803
I must apologize for Henrietta.
She learned to read on secondhand books.

185
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:55,556
Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?

186
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,434
If you are getting orange juice,
I'd love a glass too.

187
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,270
Oh. Uh, okay.

188
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:07,235
So you see
I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

189
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,737
Yeah, you put your pants on
one leg at a time.

190
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,865
Well, I step into my pants
one leg at a time,

191
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:16,202
then my trouser-maidens lift the legs
simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

192
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:19,372
Well, right, of course,
why else have trouser-maidens?

193
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:23,167
- Hey. Konichiwa, Princess Mulan.
- Just leave us alone, okay?

194
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,544
I was giving you a compliment.

195
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:27,124
First, konichiwa is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.

196
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:28,381
Second, I'm not Japanese.

197
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,716
Maybe I could put something
in that sweet mouth of yours

198
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,969
- so you don't have to talk so much.
- Whoa!

199
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,720
One more step, asshole.

200
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:35,930
- What...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

201
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,682
I was joking.
I don't want any trouble.

202
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,684
- Tell your story walking.
- The...

203
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:42,603
shit was that?

204
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,106
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.

205
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:46,816
Why do you even have a gun?

206
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,569
Well, using it in the movie
was so empowering,

207
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,405
and now I just carry it everywhere.
Do you want to hold it?

208
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,365
No, I am very anti-gun.

209
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,868
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns
is inherently...

210
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,996
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand?

211
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,416
- Slides right in, doesn't it?
- It actually feels kind of nice.

212
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:06,085
Would you like to try shooting it?
We can go to my gun range.

213
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,628
You have your own gun range?

214
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:10,965
I'm Courtney Portnoy.
I have all the things.

215
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:14,760
[clicking]

216
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,648
[breathless gasp] Whoa...

217
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,776
[Bea] I can't believe you came back.

218
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,489
- Who, me? Or BoJack?
- You look just like him.

219
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,741
- People tell me that.
- [groans]

220
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:38,624
Your mother's dementia
is progressing rapidly.

221
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,981
- You came out of nowhere.
- Yes.

222
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:43,331
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol
for the alarming creep of dementia.

223
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:46,417
- It isn't there, until it is.
- Thank you, very colorful.

224
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:49,295
We tried to call you,
but the number you gave us

225
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:52,673
- connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.
- Is that right?

226
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:54,800
This is the most responsive
she's been in weeks.

227
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:57,188
I think with regular visits
from you and your daughter...

228
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,095
That's not happening.

229
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,014
Seeing my mom
is like a Terrence Malick movie.

230
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,457
Every ten years or so is bearable,

231
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,436
but more than that
and it starts to get annoying.

232
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:06,103
She won't last another ten years.

233
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,107
- Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!
- Huh?

234
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,149
Come on, Hollyhock,
let's blow this Jell-O stand.

235
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,109
We're gonna come back though, right?

236
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,653
We can't just leave her like this.

237
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,655
You can do anything
if you believe in yourself.

238
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:17,406
- We have to come back.
- [Bea] Henrietta?

239
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,574
- Every week.
- Why?

240
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,577
Because she's your mother
and dementia is hereditary.

241
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,288
One day, you're gonna be
in a home like this, and so will I,

242
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,540
and wouldn't you want
someone visiting you?

243
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,834
[groans] Fine.
We'll come back. Happy?

244
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,295
Where's my orange juice, slag?

245
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:35,383
[gulping]

246
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,550
Ahhh!

247
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:39,095
[gulping]

248
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:40,888
Ahhh!
See ya next week.

249
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,101
[humming]

250
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,687
- Hey, are we out of milk?
- I can pick up some after work.

251
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,399
Great. Also, real quick follow-up,
why are you holding a gun?

252
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,483
Oh, my God!

253
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,653
Did I drive all the way home
without realizing I was holding a gun?

254
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,823
No wonder that guy at the gas station
didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

255
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,659
[gasps] Did I rob a gas station?

256
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,661
Classic Diane shenanigans.

257
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:07,081
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."
All right, be safe.

258
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:08,833
- [smooches]
- [sighs]

259
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:10,792
Hmm.

260
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,006
[Diane] Let's get one thing
out of the way right now.

261
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,301
If you're a man,
you're not gonna get it.

262
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,636
Some of you think you get it.
You want to get it.

263
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,639
You listen, nod
and say all the right things

264
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,057
when we tell you our stories.

265
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,977
But you still can't actually know
what it feels like

266
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,063
- to constantly have your guard up.
- [wolf whistle]

267
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:34,775
In parking garages,
walking the street, even at work.

268
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,278
I'm tired of trying
to help men understand

269
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,904
how it feels to be a woman.

270
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,948
Starting now,
I'm doing what it takes

271
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,659
to put the power in my own hands.

272
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,911
That's why I own a gun.

273
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:54,754
- That was our senior picnic.
- Oh.

274
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:57,840
Oh, here I am. There's Polio Larry.

275
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,051
Yup, she sure remembers
all the important people.

276
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,840
- [Hollyhock] And who's this?
- [Bea] That's my brother, Crackerjack.

277
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,388
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

278
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,152
Thirty seconds
after that picture was taken

279
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,262
you yelled at me
for getting ice cream on my shorts.

280
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,645
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.
I'm watching my figure.

281
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,315
Yeah, you want to look pretty
for when Death comes to visit.

282
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:15,566
Beth? No.

283
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,235
We stopped talking
after she wouldn't eat my casserole

284
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,364
and then I told the whole supper club
that her son was a gay.

285
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,063
- Ooh.
- Okay. You two enjoy each other.

286
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,409
I'm gonna go see
if I can seduce a lonely dowager

287
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:26,973
into giving me her night-night pills.

288
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,537
Wow. Is this you?

289
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:32,333
- [Bea] This is me at my debutante ball.
- You were so beautiful.

290
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,920
You could be thin, too.
Just go easy on the sweets

291
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:39,048
and when you go somewhere,
don't walk, gallop.

292
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,092
Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

293
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:44,720
[both] Morning time, Hollywoo!

294
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,514
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

295
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:48,307
And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

296
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:50,726
Here's something
I'm just now reading on a cue card.

297
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,354
All the ladies
are getting concealed carry permits.

298
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:54,605
It's the newest thing.

299
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,568
I wouldn't want to be around
one of those ladies

300
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,026
at a certain time of the month,
if you know what I mean.

301
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,820
[laughs] I don't.

302
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:03,989
Joking aside, I think it's great
these gals have a hobby.

303
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:08,536
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers
that we have a breaking news alert...

304
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:11,080
- There has been another mass shooting.
- [groans]

305
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:14,250
I am totally unqualified
to cover a news story this important.

306
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,378
But as a straight white male,
I will plow forward with confidence

307
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,797
and assume I'm doing fine.

308
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:24,135
[groans] Again with the crazy gunmen.

309
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:25,636
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

310
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,638
we're gonna have to put this movie
on the shelf

311
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:30,766
next to that wacky vacation comedy we did
about the klutzy babysitter.

312
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,270
- [Todd] Ha! That sounds hilarious!
- What the hell are you doing on this call?

313
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,772
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

314
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,024
Okay, what do all these shootings
have in common?

315
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,694
Guns? Bullets? Who are you,
Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

316
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,489
Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in Ms. Taken?

317
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,241
In a world of increasing terror,

318
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:50,661
our movie tells women
they don't have to be afraid anymore.

319
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,913
- Yeah, now you're talking.
- When you put it that way,

320
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:56,292
it almost sounds like these mass shootings
could be a good thing for the movie.

321
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,170
No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.

322
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:00,893
Thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

323
00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:02,548
- Right, thoughts and prayers.
- But...

324
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:07,344
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

325
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,306
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

326
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:11,223
Of course not!

327
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,975
Nobody wants that,
nobody's saying that.

328
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:15,519
But if they already do feel unsafe,

329
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,062
there's no reason not to capitalize.

330
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,148
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.

331
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:22,193
Exactly, we're not making them
feel unsafe.

332
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:26,489
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,
from there being more mass shootings.

333
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,823
[cell phone vibrates]

334
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:30,201
In that case,
I got good news and I got bad news.

335
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,536
Bad news is
you're gonna want to avoid the 405.

336
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,832
- Ta-da!
- Ugh! Keep it down.

337
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,834
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

338
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,628
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

339
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,588
We did a special episode about elder care.

340
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,031
Now we're gonna watch it
and learn how to handle this bitch.

341
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,550
When you say "this bitch",

342
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,886
do you mean your mom's dementia
or your mom?

343
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,805
I think you can pick that up
through context.

344
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:52,223
Season two, episode 12.

345
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,308
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up,
Mr. Dementia."

346
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:55,810
- I'll go lie down.
- [music plays]

347
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:59,355
- Hey, Ethan, who's your friend?
- [Olivia] Ethan made a friend?

348
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,565
This old man followed me home
from the park.

349
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,400
- Can I keep him?
- [audience] Aww.

350
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:07,279
- [The Horse] Here we go, again.
- [laughter and applause]

351
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,823
- BoJack?
- Mom?

352
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,325
Hush, Henrietta.
That's my son on the television.

353
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:14,537
- You know him?
- I think I'd know my own son, wouldn't I?

354
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,900
[Ethan] You heard the boss man.

355
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,750
Guess your daughter, the bikini model,
will have to pick you up at the park.

356
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,043
Daughter, the bikini model?

357
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,171
Whoa, whoa, Ethan,
this man is our guest!

358
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:26,924
[laughs]

359
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:28,759
Uh...

360
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:29,885
Huh.

361
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,557
[clears throat]

362
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,726
- You know I hate guns, right?
- I know.

363
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,979
Although my official stated
political opinion

364
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,815
is I respect the Second Amendment
but I think some gun purchases

365
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:45,234
should require the barest amount
of background checks.

366
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,778
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you know I hate guns, too.

367
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:50,197
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

368
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:53,868
But being a gun owner finally makes me
feel as safe walking down the street

369
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,287
as a man gets to feel all the time.

370
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,998
And that's an incredible feeling
I'm not ready to give up yet.

371
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,667
If you can frack under our house,
I should get to have a gun.

372
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,918
All right, that's fair.

373
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,670
I'm really proud we've found a way

374
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:07,548
to keep our personal lives
and our political lives compartmentalized.

375
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:08,632
Me, too.

376
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:12,052
- You have no idea...
- Yes. I have no idea?

377
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,591
- Is your bubble of privilege so thick...
- What's with humans and guns?

378
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:16,098
You're addicted to these things.

379
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,893
And what is it with men
and not wanting women to feel safe?

380
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,430
- I don't...
- This is a gendered issue...

381
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:21,729
- Excuse me!
- Make no mistake.

382
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,350
- I don't think women...
- You can't sympathize...

383
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:25,185
running around with guns
makes anybody safer.

384
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,687
- Yeah. That's the danger.
- I don't...

385
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:27,818
- Excuse me.
- Not the men

386
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,739
who commit 90 percent of murders,
it's the crazy hysterical women

387
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:32,923
you gotta worry about!

388
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,825
[grunting and moaning]

389
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,662
[Diane] Yes, yes! Fill my chamber
with your powerful bullets!

390
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,625
Beatrice, look who's back.

391
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,585
And we brought more Horsin' Around.

392
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:45,794
Oh? Good.

393
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,088
Because you love that BoJack, right?

394
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:52,301
Well, he's not much of a son,
but the show can be a comfort sometimes.

395
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:53,802
[exhales]

396
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,892
They were playing your dumb show
in his hospital room.

397
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:02,186
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

398
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:05,606
In the episode I saw, you walked in
on your daughter in the shower.

399
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,650
The old one. That episode got us

400
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,319
into the TV Guide
"Cheers and Jeers" column.

401
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:11,570
We did not get a "Cheers."

402
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:14,156
You always could play the fool, BoJack.

403
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,879
We have to have this conversation now,
on the way to Dad's funeral?

404
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,288
[sighs] There was so much more
I wanted to say to him.

405
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,583
Well... you can forget it now.

406
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,213
[laughs]

407
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:34,176
[Olivia] And since you saw me naked,
that means I get to see you naked!

408
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,137
[The Horse] Something tells me
I'm gonna regret this.

409
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,514
- [audience laughing]
- [groans]

410
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,975
Out of the way, hag,
you're blocking the screen.

411
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,226
Uh-huh.

412
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,526
I know this must be painful for you.

413
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,987
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

414
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,280
If I'm not getting credit
for coming, what's the point?

415
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:59,243
If only there was some way for her
to connect the BoJack from the show

416
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,245
with the BoJack who visits her every week.

417
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:05,708
- Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?
- Can we what?

418
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,585
Put on a live episode
of Horsin' Around in the nursing home.

419
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,129
- Good thinking, Hollyhock.
- Uh...

420
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,047
We'll do a Horsin' Around
here at the home.

421
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,924
She'll love it
because it's her son BoJack.

422
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:15,592
- Okay...
- Then after the show,

423
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:19,638
I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

424
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,223
When her eyes spark with recognition,

425
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,587
I'm gonna sit down next to her,
I'm gonna squeeze her hand

426
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,769
and get real close and say...

427
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:28,147
- "Fuck you, Mom."
- What?

428
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,566
I can finally tell her off!
I'm gonna say, "Look at you,

429
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,985
you old piece of shit,
rotting in a nursing home!"

430
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:35,612
- Now I have the power!
- That's what you want to say to her?

431
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:38,949
Oh, it's gonna be great!
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

432
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,244
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

433
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,042
[ringing]

434
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,334
- Hey!
- Bad news.

435
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,098
Hear about the mass shooting
outside Tulsa?

436
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,963
Terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers.

437
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,340
We really have to do something
about these men who go...

438
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,593
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

439
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:01,513
A woman mass shooter?
Oh, no, that really is bad news!

440
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:04,516
I just think this is what happens
when you give women guns.

441
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,143
They start shooting people with them.

442
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,270
I mean, do they even know
what guns are for?

443
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:11,482
I don't feel safe anymore
walking down my own street alone at night.

444
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:12,649
Me, a man!

445
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,569
I am convening a series
of congressional hearings

446
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,362
on the matter of women and guns.

447
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:20,699
Because even one death
from the bullet of a female gun owner

448
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:21,992
is too many.

449
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,453
What are my constituents supposed to do,

450
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,414
not compliment
random women on the street

451
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,124
because they might be
carrying a gun?

452
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:33,420
We cannot allow our lives
to be dictated by that kind of fear.

453
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:37,966
So you see, the trigger was specifically
designed for a man's grip

454
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,010
and a man's temperament.

455
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,512
Look, all I'm saying is

456
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:44,640
maybe you shouldn't blame women
for wanting guns.

457
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,684
Maybe you should blame
the constant societal messaging

458
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:51,897
that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.

459
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,317
So if you have a problem
with women carrying firearms,

460
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,612
you can roll up your sleeves
and actually work to create a society

461
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:03,242
where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.

462
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,621
- [gavel banging]
- The ayes have it.

463
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:11,583
Possession of any firearm is now illegal
in the state of California.

464
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,668
We did it, boys.

465
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,627
- Huzzah!
- Yes!

466
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,629
- Congratulations!
- Fabulous!

467
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:18,298
I thought that was gonna go the other way.

468
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:21,885
Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.

469
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,013
I can't believe this country hates women
more than it loves guns.

470
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,098
No?

471
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,895
BoJack, I don't know about this.

472
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,148
You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.

473
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:36,275
It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.

474
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,902
- Not that. I mean...
- Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!

475
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:43,949
[plays Horsin' Around theme]

476
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:47,369
Too bad I could never run for president,
'cause I love waffling!

477
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:48,704
Wha... What is this?

478
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:51,206
Olivia, you usually love
my breakfast humor.

479
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,666
Why so glum, sugarplum?

480
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:56,086
It's this algebra homework
that gives me the blues.

481
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,297
- X-axis? Y-axis?
- [panting and gasping]

482
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,757
Where's the 'Y'-should-I-care axis?

483
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,217
Henrietta, what are you doing?

484
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:03,844
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

485
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,305
We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act

486
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:08,515
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?

487
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,018
I wonder if there's a way
to make math fun.

488
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:13,056
- [Hollyhock] Math will never be fun.
- [clicking]

489
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:15,767
- The only thing I like is rap music songs.
- [groaning and panting]

490
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,317
Make this stop. How do I turn this off?

491
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,862
Don't change it.
I want to see if this married couple

492
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,902
can work through their differences.

493
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,581
- Gimme the remote!
- This isn't right!

494
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,451
- Guys, sharing is caring!
- [grunts]

495
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:29,328
Oh, my God. Code red, code red!

496
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:31,722
What is happening? I don't like this!

497
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,539
No!

498
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:33,863
- [Bea] Let go of me.
- Oh, God.

499
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:37,628
I am the heiress
to the Sugarman Sugarcube Company.

500
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:40,172
You can't do this to me!

501
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,090
[screaming]

502
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,260
I never get to watch what I want.

503
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,806
You think we should
still finish the episode, or...?

504
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:54,227
Our insurance policy
is very strict and very clear.

505
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:57,272
Once a resident becomes violent,
we can no longer house them.

506
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,857
Can you recommend another facility?

507
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:00,821
Frankly, at your mother's rate
of deterioration,

508
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,361
she probably doesn't have much time.

509
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:05,614
I recommend she spend it surrounded
by the people who care about her.

510
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,491
Okay, who are they?
Do you have their number?

511
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:10,327
- I was referring to you and your daughter.
- Oh. Uh...

512
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,371
We'll take her.
She can have the guest room,

513
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:15,123
- and I can sleep on the couch. Right?
- [groans]

514
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,918
Okay. If she really doesn't have
much time left.

515
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:20,420
But if we get to this time next year,
she's still hanging on,

516
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:23,465
you will be getting
a very strongly worded letter, mister.

517
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:27,719
Excuse me, could you point me
in the direction of an H&M?

518
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:29,012
- Sure.
- [click]

519
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,264
That's all we got,
once we took out all the guns.

520
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:33,141
Maybe it could work
as an H&M commercial?

521
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,352
It's a shame. It was a great movie.

522
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:37,729
[sighs] Yeah.
Cut down in the prime of its life.

523
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:40,065
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

524
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:42,275
Eh, I'll be fine.

525
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:48,323
Hey, Beatrice, you hungry?
I could make Pop-Tarts.

526
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,367
[Bea] No, thank you.

527
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,995
You want to watch
another Horsin' Around episode?

528
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:54,287
What's the point?

529
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:56,206
- Oh.
- [growls]

530
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,541
Oh, God.

531
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:08,719
I'm sorry you didn't get
to tell your mom off.

532
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,722
I keep thinking
about all the things I never said

533
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:13,015
because I was so sure
there'd be other days to say them.

534
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,559
- Why don't you tell her now?
- It's not the same.

535
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:17,644
I should have done it
back when she knew who I was,

536
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:19,104
back when it would mean something.

537
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,564
But now, she's gonna die

538
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,733
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.

539
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:24,776
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

540
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,904
- Yeah? You're not just saying that?
- She read your book, didn't she?

541
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:31,575
[sighs] Yeah, but I really wanted
to say it to her face.

542
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:36,621
Well, hey, she's here now, right?
And she has good days and bad days.

543
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:41,793
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.
And then you can totally rip into her.

544
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:43,587
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm.

545
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,713
