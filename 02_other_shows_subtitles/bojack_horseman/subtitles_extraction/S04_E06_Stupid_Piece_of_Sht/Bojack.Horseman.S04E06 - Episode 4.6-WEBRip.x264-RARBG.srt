Oh, I don't deserve breakfast. 
Shut up.

Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.

Don't eat one more cookie.

- For the baby.

- Where is the baby? I saw...

Can I take the car or what?

I don't want her driving my car,

No notice is the new notice.

- Total status move.
- You're right.

Being engaged is one thing,

132
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,654
but I'm not sure
I want to actually get married.

133
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,990
We can draw up a standard
Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:

134
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:24,118
- three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.
- Oh.

135
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,162
And I presume
you'll be arranging everything.

136
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,624
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,
but I believe traditionally

137
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:32,251
it's the bride's manager
who plans the wedding.

- Who are you talking to?

142
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:46,975
Keep it down, oaf.
You'll make the baby cry.

143
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:47,934
- Baby?
- Yes, you are.

144
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:51,437
She kept asking where the baby was,
so I had Tina get her this doll.

145
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,941
- She's totes into it.
- Mom is "totes" into a baby?

146
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:57,360
Is it possible the baby
got dipped in brandy at some point?

147
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:59,696
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas
about immigrants?

148
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,740
- I think she just wanted a baby.
- Coochie-coochie-coo...

149
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,993
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.

150
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:08,371
But she seemed really down.
And you're never around anymore.

151
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:10,123
It was getting depressing to look at her.

152
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,208
That's why I made her this pillowcase.

153
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,169
You just put this over her head
and everything is fine.

154
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:16,546
- [groans]
- [Bea] Dark in here.

155
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,382
- [growls]
- Hello?

156
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:23,594
So they're airing an F.H.B.A. Miami
marathon this weekend.

157
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,096
Does anyone want to come over?

158
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,182
Oh, I actually have a big announcement.

159
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,394
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy
this weekend.

160
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,646
- Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.
- That's amazing.

161
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,525
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual
to get married, but...

162
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:40,278
Not really. John and I are aces
and we're married.

163
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,321
- Really?
- Yeah.

164
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:42,684
Our wedding was nautical-themed.

165
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:45,116
Why nautical?
Is that, like, an asexual thing?

166
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,076
No, man. We just really like boats.

167
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,746
Asexual just means
you're not interested in sex.

168
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,248
Some asexuals are also a-romantic,

169
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,834
but others have relationships
like anyone else.

170
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,711
But involving boats?

171
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:59,339
I feel like you're getting really hung up
on the boats thing.

172
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,342
So, it's not weird
for an ace to get married?

173
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:06,512
No, if you found someone who really
accepts you for who you are, go for it.

174
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:10,600
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

175
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,397
♪ Beautiful eggs of '44 ♪

176
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,983
♪ For my baby, want some more ♪

177
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:22,153
Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.

178
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,279
[groans]

179
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,573
[thinking] You stupid garbage fire.
Everything sucks.

180
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,034
BoJack, did you see
what your mother is doing?

181
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:29,410
Isn't it incredible?

182
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:32,080
Yeah, making breakfast
at three in the afternoon. So with it.

183
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:36,125
Isn't this baby well-behaved?
Hardly ever cries.

184
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,586
Probably because you're such
a good mother, Beatrice.

185
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,670
Don't say that.

186
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:41,964
I was very nervous
to have a baby in the house,

187
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:45,218
but it turns out,
all it needed is a mother's love.

188
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:50,348
Oh, when you grow up,
you can be anything you want to be.

189
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,351
[thinking] Lousy baby.
What did it ever do that was so great?

190
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:54,769
Am I jealous of a doll?

191
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:58,606
Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug,
looking at me with its creepy doll eyes...

192
00:08:58,689 --> 00:08:59,889
She's tricking you, Hollyhock.

193
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,318
- This is not what she's really like.
- Who cares?

194
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:05,905
Whatever beef you have with your mom,
that's just a sweet confused old lady.

195
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:08,032
- [thinking] She's right.
- Wrong. She's in there.

196
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,910
- She knows exactly what she's doing.
- You are so paranoid.

197
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:14,038
Please stop fighting.
All this shouting is bad for the baby.

198
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,833
Where was that keen parenting insight
50 years ago?

199
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,877
[gasps] Henrietta,
you're unfit to be a parent.

200
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,665
- I'm unfit?
- [thinking] It's true, jackass.

201
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:24,571
You think it's so hard
to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.

202
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,844
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.
Hope I don't drop it!

203
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:28,970
[gasps]

204
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,722
Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.

205
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,225
Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.

206
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,395
What if I left it in its room all day
and didn't feed it or change it?

207
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:40,481
Oh, that's okay, too.
I must be mother of the year!

208
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,525
- BoJack.
- I know! What if for 18 years straight

209
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:46,028
I just tell it how worthless it is
every day, how it embarrasses me,

210
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,072
how my life would be better
if it was never born?

211
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:50,283
Would that be a good idea?
Probably, right?

212
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:54,412
Give me the baby back, you worthless waste
of my husband's jism!

213
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:57,957
- Oh, so you do know who I am.
- Govern yourself, Henrietta.

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,210
Hey, you think the baby would be okay
if I threw it over the side of my deck?

215
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,670
- Probably, right?
- [Bea gasps]

216
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:04,172
BoJack, don't.

217
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,339
[thinking] Do it.

218
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,399
Nah, I'm just kidding around.
Here you go, Mom.

219
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,595
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery!

220
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,555
Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh!

221
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,976
No!

222
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,462
[thinking] Nice arm.

223
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,094
- [sobbing]
- Why did you do that?

224
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:28,930
- [growling]
- You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.

225
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:32,575
This is what you do.
This is what you always do.

226
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,995
This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.
She's right. Doll never hurt anybody.

227
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,164
Doll wouldn't throw you
over the side of a mountain.

228
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,583
Gotta make things right.
Gotta get Doll back.

229
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,016
Okay, one drink. And then, Doll back.

230
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,464
You screw-up.
You're making your daughter hate you.

231
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,987
Which is good, because look what happens
when people love you.

232
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,656
Look at Penny. And Herb. And Sarah Lynn.

233
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:54,138
It's because you made them love you,
BoJack.

234
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,474
You gotta fix this, dummy.
How can you fix this?

235
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,100
Princess Carolyn?
She hates your guts.

236
00:10:58,184 --> 00:10:59,977
Todd? No.
Diane? Yes! Oh, good.

237
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,742
Good old responsible Diane,
she'll know what to do.

238
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,117
Oh... aah...

239
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,276

"California can't wait."

00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,947
Am I Ace of Base right now?

242
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,991
Because all that I want
is another one of these babies.

243
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,493
BoJack Horseman?

244
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:18,621
What is this, a will.i.am-style
celebrity endorsement video?

245
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,498
- Where's Diane?
- Oh, she's on the roof.

246
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,417
Boy, will she be surprised
to see you. Diane!

247
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,656
[thinking] What are you doing?

248
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:26,706
No, not like this.
She doesn't know I'm here.

249
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,215
First time she sees me
can't be drunk asking for help.

250
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:30,818
- What's wrong? You need help?
- Idiot.

251
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,718
You gotta get me outta here.
Where did I park?

252
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:33,928
- Um...
- Beep. Beep, beep?

253
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,513
You shouldn't be driving right now.

254
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,266
Why don't I make like Eddie Money
and take you home tonight?

255
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,977
No, I can't go home. Not without Doll.

256
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,938
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do
the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight,"

257
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:47,441
so if you're taking me home,
then I would be Eddie Money.

258
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,694
Okay, something's going on with you.

259
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,821
- It's not like you to be so testy.
- Yes, it is.

260
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,115
Everyone, take the rest of the day off.

261
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:58,422
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.
California can wait!

262
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:01,998
Elton, you have to play this wedding.

263
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,641
We want one of those Stranger Things
kids to be the ring-bearer.

264
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,710
They're still little?

265
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,462
You're gonna do a duet
with a hologram of Nat King Cole.

266
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:11,215
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive,
Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.

267
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,059
Puberty?
Can we give them something for that?

268
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,885
- Great.
- Fabulous.

269
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,220
We are killing this.

270
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:19,223
We are doing to this wedding
what Rob Durst did to that lady

00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:22,018
- and what Fred Durst did to his career.

I have terrible news. It's Meryl Streep.

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,273
- [both gasp]
- Did Meryl Streep die?

274
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,858
No, she's retiring.

275
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,026
Mr. McGregor!

276
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:33,738
You cannot just walk into a room and say,
"I have terrible news about Meryl Streep."

277
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,032
Her retirement party
is scheduled for this Saturday.

278
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:37,700
All of Hollywoo will be attending.

279
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,493
This Saturday? No, no, no!

280
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:42,204
How is ♪TortneyChortnoy
supposed to compete with that?

281
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,289
We're toast.

282
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:47,335
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl
to postpone her party?

283
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:51,255
Hmm... what if we put together
a project so enticing

284
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,923
she couldn't help but climb aboard?

285
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,469
- One more gig...
- Means no more retirement.

286
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:59,472
But what could we possibly offer her
that she hasn't already done?

287
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:03,851
- Ah. What does every actor want to do?
- Direct.

288
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,144
- Direct!
- Yeah.

289
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:08,064
But the dream of any director
is to work with Meryl Streep.

290
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:11,359
You think Meryl wants to direct
a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?

291
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,736
- Hah! What a nightmare!
- Okay, all right. Okay, fine.

292
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,196
But, okay, okay, and this...

293
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
What if all the actors in the movie
were Meryl Streep?

00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,994
- What? No!

00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:46,310
To the nightmare, non-sexy version of
Three's Company that my life has become.

304
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,855
Oh, good. Instead of getting
the doll back, like you said you would,

305
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,608
you disappeared for a few hours
and found a friend.

306
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,402
For your information, we are on the case.

307
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,529
Just need a whiff of your mom
to track the scent.

308
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:59,573
Uh, excuse me, young lady,
I'm looking for a Beatrice,

309
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:02,952
but you're way too young and attractive
to be that mean old crone.

310
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,537
- What?
- What are you doing?

311
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,416
[sniffing] Okay, I'm picking up
on some fruity overtones.

312
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:12,294
Oak, desert sage... [chuckles]
No, I'm just kidding around.

313
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,546
It's smelling humor.

314
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,132
Is this the best time
to be workshopping your tight five?

315
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:18,759
[sniffing] Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way?

316
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,970
[sniffing] No! No, no. That way!

317
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,055
- [glasses clattering]
- [sniffing]

318
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:26,100
Out the door! Come on! Here we go!

319
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,601
- [groans]
- [door opens, shuts]

320
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,939
[sniffing]

321
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,402
[thinking] Look at him. Not a care
in the world. How does he do it?

322
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:38,863
[sniffs] This is the place.

323
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:40,781
[doorbell rings]

324
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,743
- Oh, hi, I'm...
- BoJack Horseman.

325
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,870
- Felicity Huffman?
- Looking for this?

326
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,830
- Yes!
- Well, keep looking, buddy!

327
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,499
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

328
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,626
Yes.

329
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,463
[grunting]

330
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:00,301
So, instead of talking
through your issues,

331
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,012
your new thing
is to just get in really big fights

332
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,889
and then have hot angry sex?

333
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,892
- Yeah, but it kind of works.
- Does it?

334
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,394
I'm sorry,
I feel like we always talk about me.

335
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:11,979
What's going on with you, Roxie?

336
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:15,149
- I'm actually glad you asked, I...
- [grunts] Okay.

337
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,651
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice
on something?

338
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:19,648
- Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.
- Um...

339
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:22,406
So, I have this friend,

340
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,660
and his name
is Darnarius McQuimberton.

341
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,829
Oh, yeah,
I think I read an article about him

342
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,373
in Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.

343
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:34,627
Darnarius is supposed to get married
this weekend.

344
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,839
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.

345
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,341
Should he go through with it?

346
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:43,803
Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.

347
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:45,721
You're making this big declaration

348
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,265
about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,

349
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,809
but you don't actually know that.

350
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:52,561
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.

351
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:56,524
- Yeah, that's true.
- But it's a lie based on truth.

352
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,275
Like, at the center of the farce

353
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,945
there's this nugget
of something real and pure.

354
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,864
And that strange beautiful something

355
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:06,283
is why you put up
with everything else, right?

356
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,368
I guess so.

357
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:11,413
And sometimes it's hard to remember
that pure, shining thing

358
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:14,458
because it's been painted over
with so many arguments

359
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:17,002
and compromises and disappointments.

360
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:20,130
But you have to believe
it's still down there somewhere,

361
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:21,799
even if you can't see it.

362
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:26,095
And maybe even the belief in it
is more important than the thing itself,

363
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:28,806
but only as long as you still believe it.

364
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,101
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah. Thanks, Diane.

365
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:36,272
You've given me
and Darquimbertus McNarington

366
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:37,940
a lot to think about.

367
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:44,405
That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.

368
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:46,365
[groans]

369
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:47,575
[doorbell rings]

370
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:49,702
- What?
- Okay.

371
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:53,247
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.

372
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,457
And I know you're really mad at me
because...

373
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,121
Think, shit-for-brains, think.
Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you?

374
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,504
You cut her off in traffic,
got her fired off a project,

375
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:03,585
talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit
and didn't realize your mic was on.

376
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:07,636
I have been living directly under
your house for the last 15 years.

377
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,432
Do you have any idea how much shit
you throw over the side of your deck?

378
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:15,394
Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,
scripts where the lead is female.

379
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:18,230
One time, a mountain
of regurgitated cotton candy

380
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:22,610
sat on that hill for a month
before sliding into my hot tub.

381
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,153
Who you think has to deal with that?

382
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:27,197
I assume your maid
or gardener or something?

383
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:30,451
Well, yeah.
But it's still super-obnoxious.

384
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,119
You're not getting that doll back.

385
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,287
Citizens, citizens.

386
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,331
As the future governor of California,

387
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:38,918
I pride myself on probably being able
to reach compromises

388
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,836
across the ideological spectrum.

389
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,380
- Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?
- What?

390
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:44,590
- Why would we do that?
- No.

391
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:46,383
So you both agree that's a bad idea.

392
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,802
Perhaps you're not so different after all?

393
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,180
- Advantage: Peanutbutter.
- How is that...?

394
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:54,808
Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star
of film and television.

395
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:58,979
BoJack, you have also
appeared in film and television.

396
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:01,190
What's that like? Discuss.

397
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:04,151
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.

398
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,195
[thinking] I hope
she has no follow-up questions.

399
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,405
Really? So you've probably
seen my new show,

400
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,366
- F.H.B.A. Los Angeles.
- [thinking] What?

401
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:13,369
- Yup, love it.
- How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps?

402
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,913
[thinking] Ugh, TV? No.
I just got out of that sinkhole.

403
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,749
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.

404
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,085
Hup... ho... hup!

405
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,581
[Princess Carolyn] What's your status?

406
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:24,254
I have breached Compound Streep.

407
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:27,299
If I don't make it out of this alive,
just know I have already seen heaven

408
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,968
and it is Meryl's rose garden.

409
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,011
- And the offer?
- I put it under a big box

410
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:32,304
that's propped up by a stick.

411
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,223
If she goes to look
and the box falls on her,

412
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,350
she's contractually obligated
to do the movie.

413
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,560
Yeah, I know what
"packaging talent" means.

414
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,004
Okay, she's walking up to the box.

415
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:43,148
She's sniffing around, and...

416
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:46,193
- [box slides, woman screams]
- We got Meryl!

417
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,153
All right! Yes!

418
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,205
[thinking] What if I throw myself
off my deck

419
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,658
into Felicity Huffman's backyard.

420
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,119
If she found my dead body,
that'd show her.

421
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,370
Why are we at a bar?

422
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,372
We're just celebrating getting Doll back.

423
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,583
You don't want to bring the doll back
to your mom?

424
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,267
I will. We're just having a drink first.

425
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:04,878
- Relax.
- Okay.

426
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,672
[thinking] He knows you're terrible.

427
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:09,378
He's the biggest idiot in the world,
even he knows you're terrible.

428
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,136
So when did you get a daughter?
She's new, right?

429
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:15,514
- Or was she always part of the gang?
- I met her about a month ago.

430
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,975
- Whoa!
- Yeah. And it was great, at first.

431
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,768
But now I can feel her getting attached,

432
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,603
and I just know
I'm gonna BoJack things up.

433
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,938
"BoJack things up?"

434
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:25,733
You mean, show up somewhere
and be the life of the party?

435
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,152
Then share a laugh
with your good friend, Mr. Peanutbutter?

436
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,863
No, obviously I meant screw everything up
until she hates me.

437
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,322
I don't think I can take that.

438
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,576
Maybe this time, don't do the thing
that makes her hate you.

439
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,911
I don't want to,
but every time she looks at me

440
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,538
with those big innocent eyes,

441
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,957
all I can think about
is every shitty thing I've ever done,

442
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,209
and I think,
"I don't deserve that kind of love."

443
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:47,212
Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot
about balancing a state budget

444
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:49,214
- or how a bill becomes a law.
- Uh...

445
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:51,258
I don't know a lot about a lot of things.

446
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:55,054
But I do know this:
everybody deserves to be loved.

447
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:57,973
[clinking]

448
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:02,895
So we put together an all-star wedding
and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!

449
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:05,522
- You got to admit, we're a good team.
- Rutabaga...

450
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,692
I know it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Good Ship You and Me,

451
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,028
but now you've got a boyfriend
and I've got a family,

452
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:14,364
and since we have to work together again,
we're a good team.

453
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,200
Tell me you didn't miss this.

454
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,786
- Todd is on line two.
- Aaah! Do you go through the walls?

455
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,497
Todd! Have you finished
your groomsmen list?

456
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,749
We gotta figure out
how many parachutes we need.

457
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:26,960
Uh, guys, I... I can't marry Courtney.

458
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,420
- What?
- No!

459
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:32,508
I've been doing some thinking,
and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.

460
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,843
The lollipop part is a lie,

461
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,679
but at the center of the lie
there's a truth.

462
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:40,891
That's the Tootsie Roll,
and that's why people get married.

463
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:45,145
But if I married Courtney
it would be a lie without any truth in it,

464
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:48,774
like a Tootsie Pop
with just the lollipop part

465
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,651
and nothing in the middle.

466
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:54,196
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.

467
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,739
[Todd] I guess it's a bad analogy.

468
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,449
But I don't want a fake marriage.

469
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,868
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.

470
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:03,122
[sighs] Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.

471
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,457
Thanks, Princess Carolyn.
Whoa...

472
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,583
[groans]

473
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,963
All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow?

474
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,048
Courtney got jilted,
play the sympathy card?

475
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,925
I guess we could put out a statement.

476
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,051
That's your solution?

477
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:18,715
What happened to the guy
from this morning with all the big ideas?

478
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:21,723
Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.

479
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:24,852
I got seven kids and a wife
who's really into me co-parenting,

480
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,728
or, as she calls it, "parenting."

481
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:30,065
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,
read them some script coverage

482
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:32,651
of the film adaptation of Good Night Moon
and then come back?

483
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:35,571
- This is important.
- Well, my kids are important.

484
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:37,447
Fine, both things are equally important.

485
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,700
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.

486
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:42,077
You would be hilarious at it.
[sips]

487
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:45,247
Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.

488
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,166
We'll figure this out. We'll deal with it.

489
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,668
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

490
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,796
If you'd like to never see him again,
I have ways of getting rid of him.

491
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,423
What kind of ways?

492
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,843
Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.

493
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,126
I apologize for misleading you
about the number of ways.

494
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,972
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?

495
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,640
I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.

496
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,393
When I left, I swore
I would never work at a big agency again,

497
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,854
because I can't work
with people like that.

498
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,137
You don't think I'm like that?

499
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,691
No, because you care about people
other than yourself.

500
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:15,569
And for what it's worth,
you will be a wonderful mother.

501
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:18,280
- You're not just saying that?
- I never just say anything.

502
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:19,573
I choose words very carefully,

503
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,825
with an eye towards precision
and expediency.

504
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,577
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.

505
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,871
- Good night, Judah.
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:29,166
[door closes]

507
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,634
[muffled grunts and yells]

508
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:45,265
Oh! Okay. [chuckles]

509
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,847
- It's about time, Henrietta.
- You're welcome.

510
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,386
[growls]

511
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,986
[thinking] Go talk to her, idiot.

512
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,781
Drink first. No, you stupid alcoholic.

513
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,450
Talk to your daughter. You're ruining her.
You know that, right?

514
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:05,333
No matter what,
your poison is already in her.

515
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,204
There's nothing you can do.
That's not true.

516
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,807
Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.

517
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:12,626
You're a real stupid piece of shit,
and everywhere you go you destroy people.

518
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,252
Your mother never loved you.

519
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,541
That's why Sarah Lynn died,
Charlotte'll never forgive you.

520
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,299
What you gonna do to Hollyhock?
What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up!

521
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,908
[exhales]

522
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,268
Got Doll back. No big deal.

523
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:34,035
Where do you go,
when you disappear all day?

524
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:38,193
Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.

525
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:40,320
Sometimes I pull over
by the side of the road,

526
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,364
just sit there for hours.

527
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:43,448
Why?

528
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,452
And you'd rather do that

529
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,538
- than spend time with me?
- Hollyhock...

530
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:52,124
I know you didn't ask
for this dorky 17-year-old

531
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,542
to just show up at your door.

532
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,585
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,
but I didn't ask...

533
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,046
- No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
- Oh.

534
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,632
If I'm shitty,
that's just because I'm shitty.

535
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:03,635
You're allowed to be mad at me,
but you need to know that whatever I do,

536
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,535
it's not your fault.

537
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:12,144
I know. I mean, I know,
but I don't always know, you know?

538
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:15,307
Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice
in the back of my head that goes, like,

539
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:19,081
"Hey, everyone hates you!
And they're not wrong to feel that way!"

540
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:20,902
I know what you mean.

541
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:25,407
That voice, the one that tells you
you're worthless and stupid and ugly?

542
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,201
- Yeah?
- It goes away, right?

543
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:32,316
It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl
thing, but then it goes away?

544
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:34,249
Yeah.
