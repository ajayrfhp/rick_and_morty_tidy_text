1
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,830
- Huh?
- Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

2
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,093
- I don't have actual honey.
- [sighs]

00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,802
- [laughter]
- Diane!

4
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:16,056
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. Mwah.

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,766
BoJack Horseman!

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,601
- Put her there!
- That's all right.

7
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,228
I'm gonna get that handshake.

8
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:22,520
No, you're not.

9
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:23,855
[laughs] Since when am I Honey?

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,441
Since now.

11
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,525
I made up the nickname
while you were back east.

12
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,903
Yeah, really? You made
up calling someone honey?

13
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,529
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

14
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,282
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride?

15
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,657
That's okay. Todd's supposed to pick me up.

16
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,076
Where is he?

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,827
- [indistinct chatter]

18
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:40,163
First day, huh? [Laughs]

19
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,249
Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi...

20
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:45,001

22
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:48,171
Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.

23
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,299
Hey, I'll take the ride as
long as it's not as bumpy

24
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:51,841
as that pilot's landing.

25
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,510
That was seriously very scary.

26
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:55,553
- Hey...
- I'm just glad you were there,

27
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,555
because I really would
have freaked out by myself.

28
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,682
Be stiller, my beating heart.

29
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,435
Stiller crazy after all these years.

30
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,019
- [laughter]
- Did I miss something funny?

31
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:05,230
- I love funny somethings.
- No, we were just laughing

32
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,690
about this Ben Stiller
article from the plane.

33
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,109
- [laughter]
- Ooh, he is the best.

34
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,153
- What did it say?
- You wouldn't get it.

35
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:13,696
Either you read Hemisphere's
Magazine, or you don't.

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,533
Hey, I might be crazy, because
this is such a dumb question,

37
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,910
and I'm embarrassed to even ask,

38
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:23,457
but do I have anything to
worry about with you and Diane?

39
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,292
What?

40
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,128
[laughs] What?

41
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,754
Get out of here.

42
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,048
I got to say, BoJack,

43
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,633
that is a relief.

44
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,970
Ho-ho! Whoo!

[panting]

00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,667
Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner?

49
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,961
Or at least some road sodas,

50
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,754
so I don't have to go through the ordeal

51
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,464
of sobering up and then having
to get drunk all over again?

52
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,758
Oh, I actually already made special plans

53
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,093
for just the two of us.

54
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,510
Oh, come on.

55
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,012
You're the one who's always saying

56
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,889
you want to hang out with BoJack more,

57
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,474
and how it's weird that BoJack
never returns your calls,

58
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,310
and how I should hang up the phone

59
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,019
because maybe BoJack's
trying to call you right now.

60
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,687
Uh, okay.

61
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:56,732
I guess we can make this work.

62
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,609
- [laughter]
- Oh.

63
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,028
Oh, man. Remember that guy in 34-B?

64
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,823
Do I? Can't stop remembering him.

65
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,783
Uh, hey. Diane and I have memories, too.

66
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,535
This place reminds me of
a cliff side meal we had

67
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,122
one romantic vacay to Cabo.

68
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,498
Boring. I wasn't there.

69
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,917
Can we keep this general interests?

70
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,045
Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.

71
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,421
Mmm.

72
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:20,965
Oh, oh. Ew.

73
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,216
There's something in my food.

74
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,425
Ah, crap. Someone get the manager.

75
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,178
No, no, no. Wait.

76
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:28,014
It's supposed to be in
there. Welcome home, honey.

77
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:32,601
I got you a D pendant,
because I am D-pendant on you.

78
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,561
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Real... Real cute.

79
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,231
- A D for dog.
- It's for Diane.

80
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:40,901
This is the sweetest choking
hazard anyone's ever given me.

81
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,903
- [moans]
- Mwah.

82
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,989
Well, how about some
champagne for the happy couple.

83
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,907
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom

84
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,451
to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.

85
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,120
You're too kind,

86
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,290
but everyone knows you go
off menu for the good stuff.

87
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,959
Yes, get me your most
expensive bottle from the back.

88
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:00,629
Perhaps a 1922-ISH Heidsieck Diamant Bleu?

89
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:03,924
A toast on me to Diane
and Mr. Peanutbutter.

90
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,926
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.

91
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,428
Off the menu, of course.

92
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,597
- [all cheering]
- BoJack, folks. What a sport.

93
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,641
And while we're all in giving moods,

94
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,270
I'd like to buy you all
an Xbox, courtesy of me.

[all cheering]

00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,732
Wow. You guys don't have to do this.

97
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,026
Look, I could happily
go down this petty road

98
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,277
of raising and re-raising one another.

99
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,820
Man: Please do!

100
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,488
But I'd instead like to highlight the fact

101
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:28,324
that Mr. Peanutbutter's
ripping off my toast

102
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,411
the same way he ripped
off my entire career.

103
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:34,247
Man 2: Uh, we prefer
gifts over observations.

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,957
Okay. Well, here's
something I didn't rip off.

105
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,126
This brand new helicopter I just bought.

106
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,628
Whoo-whoo! Who wants
a ride in the chopper?

107
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:43,923
- [applause and cheering]
- Okay, guys. This has been fun,

108
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,592
and also an offensive
display of extravagant wealth,

109
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:48,052
but maybe we should call it a night.

110
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,345
What's the rush?

111
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:50,554
Because I just bought the restaurant,

112
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,181
and we can stay as long as we want.

113
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,515
- [all cheering]
- Hey, you. I own you now.

114
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,436
- Do a dance.
- [scats]

115
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:01,357
Oops.

116
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,900
[laughs] Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

117
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,069
- It's all yours.
- Please, you first.

118
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,529
Apparently, we both like to be clean.

119
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,699
I love being clean. That's so coincidental.

120
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,410
- I'm Todd.
- Klaus.

121
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,328
Look, I know you're new here,

122
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:18,958
but we have a lot in common:
being white, into cleansing.

123
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,543
I think you'd enjoy hanging
out with me and the gang.

124
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,922
When you say "the gang,"
do you mean a gang?

125

Check this out. If you
want to lift weights,

127
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,677
If you like toilet wine,
we spent the past 20 years

128
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,263
perfecting pruno.

129
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:35,015
The Aryan nation is
number one for a reason.

130
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,476
Never thought I'd say this,

131
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,769
but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.

132
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,562
Hey, tell you what. Drop
by our party tomorrow.

133
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,815
Shoot the shit with the
guys, mostly about Jews,

134
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,608
and make up your own mind.

135
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,319
Until then, take my card.

136
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,822
Whoa. Uh, where were you keeping that card?

137
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:52,783
Both: Forty-five, forty-six,

138
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,910
forty-seven...

139
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,579
Guys, can we give this thing a rest?

140
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,290
Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.

141
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm twice as not tired.

142

143
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:11,260

[vibrates and rings]

Todd: BoJack!

146
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,265
Todd, where the hell have you been?

147
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:17,933
I had to carpool home from the airport

148
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:19,810
like a goddamn environmentalist.

149
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,979
I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.

150
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,357
Well, you called the right
person, because I need your help

151
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,941
and you're my phone-a-friend.

152
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,944
Marie Curie won Nobel
prizes in which two sciences?

153
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,530
A, chemistry and physics.

154
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:33,574
- B, biology and physics...
- Oh, B! The answer's B!

155
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:34,992
- It's A!
- Damn it, Todd!

156
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,536
This was life or death.

157
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,662
Same with me. The bail's set at 50 bucks.

158
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,747
I'll be here wai...

159
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,126
[groaning]

160
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,881
Yes! I am the champion of the games!

161
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,008
Did you see that, Diane?

162
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,468
Diane?

163
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:53,719
You win, old friend.

164
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,221
Now if you'll excuse me,

165
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:57,806
I'm going to take my girlfriend to bed.

166
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,392
[groans]

167
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,893
We're still out?

168
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:02,520
[groans]

169
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,854
Night, BoJack.

170
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,273
Good night, Diane.

171
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:09,402
Give me a bottle of something
to help me forget my problems.

172
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:11,237
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

173
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,988
What is this, breakfast?

174
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:14,656
Yeah, that's about right.

175
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,076
[gulping]

176
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,874
Well, that worked effectively.

177
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,043
Newsman: It's a Holly-who-done-it

178
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,628
as police are scrambling to figure out

179
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,464
who stole the D from
the famed Hollywood sign.

180
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,841
- Holly-what?
- All of Tinseltown's

181
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:35,886
at DEFCON 5 until their
diabolically displaced D

182
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,347
is demonstrably displayed once more.

183
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,015
Can we cool it with the alliteration?

184
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,768
Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.

185
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,437
Weird.

186
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,687
Weirder.

187
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:47,231
[doorbell rings]

188
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:49,149
Why the hell would I steal a giant D?

189
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,110
Ding-dong! It's Diane.

190
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,737
D... D... Damn!

191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,239
Meanwhile, local authorities

192
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,949
are already investigating several suspects.

193
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:59,493
David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX,

194
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,413
and of course Dane Cook,
who we all know is a thief.

195
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:05,707
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

196
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,377
I can't work on the book
today. Too ill. Cough.

197
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,337
Are you ill, or hung-over?

198
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,839
Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

199
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,467
Plus you left me a long,
drunken voice-mail last night.

200
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,759
Ooh, was it bad?

201
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,052
It was mostly a lot of wheezing,

202
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,596
as if you were climbing something,

203
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,222
followed by the sounds
of dismantling metal,

204
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:21,723
and then grunting like you
were dragging something heavy

205
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,225
at least a few miles.

206
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,227
I didn't say anything incriminating, did I?

207
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,146
As incriminating as that question? No.

208
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,689
Good. Well, just as a general rule,

209
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:29,898
you probably shouldn't be listening

210
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,609
to any voicemails I leave after...

211
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,277
- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,404
- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

213
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,531
What's that? An actor
flaking on an obligation?

214
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,617
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- I think you mean Hollywoo.

215
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,743
Did you see? Someone
stole the D off the sign.

216
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,078
Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough.

217
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,498
Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.

218
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,458
- [phone rings]
- What is it, BoJack?

219
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,835
You know, I'm tied up
with all my Deans today.

220
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,795
Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz,

221
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,631
all being questioned by police.

222
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,257
It was me. I stole the D.

223
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:56,925
- What?
- Now be a good agent

224
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,177
and make this not my problem.

225
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,970
How did you even...?

226
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,222
You know, your scandal-to-work
ratio is, like, five to one.

227
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,224
Look, I need to get rid of
this before Diane sees it.

228
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,686
Why do you care if Dia... Oh, fish.

229
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,937
Are you in love with your biographer?

230
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,064
What?

231
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,567
<i>[laughs] What?</i>

232
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,611
Get out of here.

233
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,780
You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable.

234
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:20,407
Yeah, I don't know. The
D might be for David,

235
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,075
because apparently when I was drunk,

236
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,578
I printed out a bunch of
pictures of David Boreanaz.

237
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,206
Yeah. You did that.

238
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,999
Look, I'll keep your little
crush busy long enough

239
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,501
for you to get rid of the contraband,

240
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,793
but the next three weddings I'm invited to,

241
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,462
you're my date, dummy.

242
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,089
Since when to women your
age get invited to weddings?

243
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,383
I have a lot of nieces and nephews!

244
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,676
[phone beeps off]

245
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,093
- [claps]
- Well, you pulled it off,

246
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,679
you deviant.

247
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:44,390
Get it? D-viant?

248
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:45,932
- I got it.
- Tell me,

249
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,851
how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?

250
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,520
With the chain-link fence
from Dodger's Stadium?

251
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,356
No. How'd you figure out it was me?

252
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,067
Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,

253
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,028
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,

254
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,780
and also, what did I do?

255
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:02,074
Oh, I listened to the voice-mail you left me

256
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:04,618
saying you were stealing
the D because of Diane

257
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:08,080
so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

258
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:10,040
Stop leaving voicemails!

259
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,292
Admit it! You like my girlfriend.

260
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,337
Oh, come on. I mean, am
I attracted to her? Sure.

261
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,548
Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.

262
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,384
Does she get me in ways no
woman ever has? Indubitably.

263
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,011
Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.

264
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:24,930
Look, am I the kind of
guy who would try to steal

265
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,223
someone else's girlfriend?

266
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,808
Sure, of course, but do I like her?

267
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,227
The answer's no. You have
nothing to worry about.

268
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,812
I'll cut you a deal.

269
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,647
I help you get rid of that D,

270
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,650
and you never talk to Diane again.

271
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,486
Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.

272
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,573
Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?

273
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,366
- Deal.
- Ha!

274
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,453
- I knew I'd get that handshake.
- I regret this already.

275
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:54,418
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.

276
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,045
Both: Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.

277
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,005
- [laughs]
- Did we just say that...

278
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,966
- Oh!
- At the same time?

279
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,719
Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.

280
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,847
Now, the Aryan's are good
guys. Don't get me wrong.

281
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,140
But I don't know if you're gonna get

282
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,016
the right attention over there.

283
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,352
Uh, I'd hate to get
lost in a shop that big.

284
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,271
Now we can't offer you the works,

285
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,482
but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.

286
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:20,068
We're number two, and
that means we try harder.

287
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,571
Am I really being courted by two gangs?

288
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,449
Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.

289
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,662
So, this is the shapeless biographer

290
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,413
I've heard so much about.

291
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:33,915
We've met several times.

292
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,751
Did you just call me here to insult me?

293
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,377
What is your secret, lady?

294
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,839
I mean, how do you get two
grown men fighting over you

295
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,841
like a foul ball at a football game?

296
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,592
First of all, football
doesn't have foul balls.

297
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:45,093
Ugh, sports.

298
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,763
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.

299
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,097
Open your eyes.

300
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,974
BoJack's clearly in love with you.

301
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:56,647
Wha...?

302
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,190
Get out of here!

303
00:11:58,273 --> 00:11:59,817
Get out of here? Why
would I get out of here?

304
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,985
You get out of here. This is my office.

305
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:05,865
I get the army men are police,

306
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,449
but what's the mustard packet again?

307
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,284
Oh, that's just a mustard packet.

308
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:10,870
- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.

309
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,287
Well, can we move it off the table?

310
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,622
No. I still might want it later.

311
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:14,874
Good call.

312
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,876
So how do we get the D from here

313
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,627
all the way up to here?

314
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,337
What, with all these cops and mustards,

315
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,922
- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.

316
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,632
The pickle's a SWAT van,
but I see your point.

317
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:27,887
Might be easier to just
ditch the evidence. But how?

318
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,513
I... I don't know.

319
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,640
You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.

320
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,016
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

321
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:34,727
Is that why I feel drunk?

322
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,812
Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.

323
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,355
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas,

324
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,357
but it's been great for camaraderie.

Ooh, hey. What time is it?

I probably need to move my helicopter.

328

It's in a two-hour zone.

329

You beautiful bastard, that's it!

330

We can pick up the D with your
chopper, fly it out of here,

331
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,537
and then dump it out into the ocean.

332
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,955
Stupendous!

333
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:56,749

- What now, Todd?
- Listen.

336
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:04,047
So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

337
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,384
The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,

338
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,595
so do you remember how
you got out of the same jam

339
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:10,846
on Horsin' Around?

340

Ah, a classic conundrum.

341
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,935
Well, I recall one time on
Mr. Peanutbutter's House...

342
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,269
I think he's talking to me, pal.

343
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,729
You know, the guy whose show

344
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,022
invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.

345
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,150
You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.

346
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:25,778
The only thing you ever perfected

347
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,613
- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?

348
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,489
Now you're even stealing
the words I'm saying.

349
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,074
You know, it's tough.

350
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,911
I agree with the Latin
Kings on social issues,

351

Well, juggling both never ends well.

Mr. Peanutbutter, anything to contribute?

He's just staring blankly now.

Stealing your thunder.

356
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,674
You could also just bail
me out of here, as I said.

357
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,050
- It's only 50 bucks...
- Got to go, pal.

Hope it's a magical night.

All right, you ready for the plan?

Oh, yeah.

But we are gonna need a big distraction

You leave that to me.

Whoa, wait. You had a lot to drink.

was like the fifth
