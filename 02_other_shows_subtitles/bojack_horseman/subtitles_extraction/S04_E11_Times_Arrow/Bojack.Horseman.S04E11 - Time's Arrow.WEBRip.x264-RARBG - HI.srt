00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:14,939
Slow down, Henrietta.
A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,335
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

3
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,754
My son is a ball of gas.

4
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:23,507
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas!

5
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,926
But you're also a star.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,428
Wait. Mom, do you remember...

7
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,097
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,976
Sun, you're a ball of gas,
but you're also a star.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,646
- We call you... "Sun."
- Ugh!

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,315
Where are you taking me?
Are we going to the lake house?

11
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:42,735
No, we're going
to a glorious magical place

12
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:45,154
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself

13
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,156
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,950
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Why are you driving so slowly?

15
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,577
- Hurry up!
- Wait. You just said...

Time's arrow neither stands still
nor reverses, after all.

17
00:00:55,623 --> 00:01:00,044
It merely marches forward.
Isn't that right, Henrietta?

Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

- But I wanna slide.
- This is no mere slide.

We three are members

led by I,
Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

You may not enter.

- Yeah, and also you're fat.
- Oh!

I'm not fat. [coughs]

39
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,694
Even your lungs expostulate

40
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:51,280
as they struggle to expel
your ample corpulence.

41
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,033
She's saying your lungs
think you're fat too.

Father says I'm just growing.

If you do not halt, we will be forced
to physically impede your egress.

Father, I don't feel well.
[coughing]

50
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:20,893
I don't care if you're scared
of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

51
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,478
you have to go to school.

52
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,647
Now stop making books your friends.

53
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,316
Reading does nothing for young women
but build their brains,

54
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,820
taking valuable resources away
from their breasts and hips.

Dear Lord.

[Joseph] Now listen here, it's
a mother's duty to keep her children alive

61
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,839
and you are continually failing!

62
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:53,092
How could you not have known
she has scarlet fever?

63
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:55,761
Say something, damn it!
What has become of you?

64
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,055
I swear if I'd known
this is how you'd behave

65
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,933
once we severed the connections
to your prefrontal cortex,

66
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,434
I'd hardly have bothered.

67
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:05,146
- Father?
- [gasps] Yes, darling?

68
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,605
Am I to die?

69
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,066
Well, eventually yes,
but this illness is but a hiccup

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,026
in what will be a long and happy life,

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,736
- I promise.
- You promise?

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,738
In fact, some good
may yet come of this.

73
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,074
Doctor says your throat
is nearly swollen shut.

74
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,118
So perhaps you'll finally lose
some of that weight

75
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,452
that's given you such troubles.

76
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,885
- Won't that be nice?
- Yes, Father.

77
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,544
- Ow!
- Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

78
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,796
Polly, be a darling and fetch me
a pretty pill

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,381
and a glass of water, won't you?

80
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,216
Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

81
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,510
Beatrice, you're looking well,
which is just fine,

82
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:39,054
because your debutante party
is vitally important.

83
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,724
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

84
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:44,393
or bring back civil rights
activist Medgar Evers,

85
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,478
who was shot in Mississippi
this week?

86
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:50,032
Yes! Or rather, it will end you
worrying about that nonsense

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,565
because it will land you a husband.

88
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:57,018
At least Evers' death means no one else
will be assassinated this year, 1963.

89
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:00,901
The FBI is on too high alert to allow
anything like that to happen again.

90
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:03,204
- Hmm?
- Yes... well...

91
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:04,914
Your chaperone,
Corbin Creamerman,

92
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,582
is a fine young man.

93
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,792
Oh, jeez.

94
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,495
- My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.
- Thanks.

95
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,469
So... uh, you look nice.

96
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,305
Thank you, Corbin.
That's the third time you've told me.

97
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,765
You needn't tell me again.

98
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:26,685
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at these things.

99
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:29,688
But sometimes I am.
I can be. I... I really try to be.

100
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,399
I'm, well, I... I'm not. I'm really not.
I don't know why.

101
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,361
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

102
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:37,279
[Joseph]
Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

103
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:40,574
is founder of Creamerman's
Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

104
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:44,078
Think of all the free iced cream
you could, uh, serve to other people.

105
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,039
Father, do you aim to marry me off
to Corbin Creamerman

106
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:49,166
merely because it would be good
for business?

107
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,210
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

108
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,505
of how a Sugarman/Creamerman
alliance might be advantageous.

109
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,798
- Uh-huh.
- For example,

110
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,759
imagine a television advertisement
with a fun jingle.

111
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:01,178
♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪

112
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,930
♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪

113
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,057
♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪

114
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,726
And then it's Mort and me,
and we're holding up our products

115
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,480
with big smiles from across
a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

116
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:14,775
Father, common Americans
don't want you on their TV sets.

117
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,945
You're a reminder of the disparity
of wealth in this country.

118
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,364
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

119
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,992
You know, I sent you to Barnard
to get your MRS

120
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:25,202
from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

121
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,121
but instead of a bachelor
you returned home

122
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:30,374
with a bachelor's degree
and a mouth full of sass.

123
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,959
What a waste!

124
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,877
[sighs]

125
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,255
- [Corbin] You look nice.
- Thank you.

126
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:41,719
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?
Doth my eye belie me?

127
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:45,431
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.
Why are you here?

128
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:48,892
I must say,
it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

129
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,520
Better late than never, hmm?
[chuckles]

130
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:55,441
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,
who has very old-fashioned ideas

131
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:57,484
about how a woman is to live her life.

132
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,571
Poor Corbin here is saddled
with chaperoning me.

133
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,013
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

134
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,450
In truth,
I find these parties to be garish,

135
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,785
self-serving wastes of money.

136
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,372
Oh, and I'm sure yours
was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

137
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,623
[spits and coughs]

138
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:15,366
Oh, my! How repugnant!

139
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:20,022
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

140
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,010
- Do I know you?
- [chuckles]

141
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:26,263
Nope, just crashing some dumb
debutante's party. [chuckles]

142
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:30,768
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"
to describe the party or the debutante?

143
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,395
Because I might agree with you,
or I might be offended.

144
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,397
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

145
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,108
Beatrice Sugarman.
Welcome to my dumb party.

146
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,402
Butterscotch Horseman.
Charmed, I'm sure.

147
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:41,695
You crash a lot of these?

148
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,781
I'll take my free alcohol
where I can get it.

149
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,907
Saving for California.

150
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,158
What's in California?

151
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,577
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

152
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,497
This is where you ask me
if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

153
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,791
I am familiar with the Beats,
thank you.

154
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,126
I like Ginsberg all right,
but if you ask me,

155
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,170
that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

156
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:00,464
- What's your interest in them?
- What's my interest?

157
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,466
They're the greatest minds
of our generation.

158
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,095
I'm heading west to join them,
because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

159
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,679
- I see.
- You will see.

160
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:09,556
I'm writing the next
Great American Novel.

161
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,392
Oh, what's it about?

162
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,227
It's about truth! It's about war!

163
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,688
It's about the twilighting frontier
of the lives that were promised us.

164
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:19,358
But what is it about?
Who are the characters?

165
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,068
I never claimed to have
the whole thing

166
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,361
sorted out just yet, did I?

167
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:23,654
Sounds like a best seller.

168
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,698
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing
for a woman to be.

169
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:29,493
I don't know how you expect
to nab a husband at a party like this

170
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,744
with a personality like that.

171
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:34,665
Oh, congratulations. You and my father
express the same concerns.

172
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,250
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,127
I'd be anxious
to get you married off, too.

174
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,337
I bet your thank-you letters
are perfunctory,

175
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,006
your flower arrangements
are uninspired,

176
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,008
and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

177
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,218
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

178
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,804
Looks like you pegged me
as well as I pegged you.

179
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:50,013
[clicks tongue]

180
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,141
What must your mother think of you?

181
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:55,602
Oh, she doesn't think much...
about anything, anymore.

182
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,354
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

183
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:00,482
- No, not exactly.
- Mine did.

184
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,192
I'm very sorry to hear that.

185
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,445
I was little. I don't remember, really.

186
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:08,323
But she had a diamond just like yours.
I saw it in a picture once.

187
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:09,491
Oh...

188
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,452
- [BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.
- What?

189
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,614
I'd like to leave her here.

190
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,123
Can I pay for the next five years now
so I don't have to think about her again?

191
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,791
- Wha... Oh.
- [Corbin] Oh, jeez, I...

192
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,253
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we have to do the thing now,

193
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,422
where we do the... things.

194
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,674
Oh... oh, right. Um...

195
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:29,261
- Please excuse me.
- Of course, it sounds very important.

196
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:33,098
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman
present their daughter,

197
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:35,684
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

198
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,812
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

199
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:41,982
Look at her go, folks.

200
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,026
Clearing every hurdle.

201
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,652
Look at that form.

202
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,613
What precise movements.

203
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,568
- [Beatrice] Five, six...
- [man] Beautiful trot.

204
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:51,116
[softly] Truly outstanding.

205
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,118
A lovely lady indeed.

206
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,704
- Ta-da!
- [applause]

207
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,956
[clears throat]
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

208
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,041
Oh...

209
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,753
Excuse me.

210
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,881
Don't you know it's rude to leave
without saying goodbye to the hostess?

211
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,132
Why don't you come with me?

212
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:10,255
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,
thus eliminating my transgression.

213
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:14,014
Oh! You want me to leave
my own party with you?

214
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,308
The low-life who wasn't even invited?

215
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:18,101
- [glass shatters]
- Yeah.

216
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,395
But I suppose Daddy
wouldn't like that, would he?

217
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,235
[both moaning]

218
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:28,544
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

219
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,993
- I have wonderful news.
- I'm reading.

220
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:38,497
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.
He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,250
I am not interested
in Corbin Creamerman.

222
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,877
I don't give a damn
where your interests lie!

223
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:46,713
After the disappearing act you pulled
at your own party,

224
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,550
you're lucky I don't fill a jar
with jellied beans

225
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,636
and marry you off to the man
who can closest estimate the amount.

226
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,762
Heavens!

227
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:56,473
Corbin Creamerman is willing
to give you a second chance,

228
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:59,226
he is downstairs waiting,
and you will be civil to him.

229
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,310
[huffs]

230
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,105
And the way they make
non-dairy creamer

231
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:06,483
is by replacing the milk fat
with vegetable oil.

232
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,527
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

233
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,821
- Pretty nifty, huh?
- Is that so?

234
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,408
- Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.
- Not at all. I don't find you boring.

235
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,243
Only the things you choose
to talk about,

236
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:17,995
and the way in which
you talk about them.

237
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,040
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...
I just get excited by food chemistry.

238
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,084
You know, you take something
you thought you knew,

239
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,128
and then discover
there's so much more to it

240
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,796
than you could have possibly imagined.

241
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,424
- It's like... magic.
- Oh?

242
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:32,342
My father is less enchanted.

243
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,345
He says it's just squeezing money
out of cow teats.

244
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,098
I suppose that's true,
but I got ideas too,

245
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:42,436
and I feel I never get to be anything
other than what he expects me to be.

246
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,396
You know what that's like?

247
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,772
I do.

248
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,107
You know, Corbin,

249
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,277
it occurs to me
that perhaps you and I aren't so...

250
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,945
- [retching]
- Oh, dear!

251

[screams]

252
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:03,915
[whistles]
Nice gams.

253
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,125
[whistles]
Nice gams.

254
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,669
Is that the only thing
you can think of to say?

255
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,297
[whistles]
Nice... gams.

256
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,507
- [sighs]
- Uh...

257
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:17,137
- Beatrice, what are you doing here?
- I had to look you up in the phone book.

258
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,141
The number you gave me
was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.

259
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:22,309
What? Are you sure?

260
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,061
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

261
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,021
- Wha...
- [whistles] Whoa, boy!

262
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,939
Come on, Bopper,
can you give us some privacy?

263
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,900
Sure thing, Butterscotch.
You take it easy.

264
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,777
[whistling]

265
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,653
Are you certain it's mine?

266
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:35,322
Well, whose else could it be?

267
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,574
What do you wanna do?
Maybe you have a cousin,

268
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,618
who has a... a friend,
who knows a doctor,

269
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,787
who can take care
of such inconveniences?

270
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,997
I'm... I'm happy to do
the gentlemanly thing and...

271
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,540
and pay for the cab fare.

272
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,710
No. I can't.

273
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:51,004
Well, that doesn't leave us
with very many options.

274
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,255
I'm a ruined woman.

275
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,299
Don't be hysterical.
You're not ruined.

276
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:57,010
It's a verifiable fact
you look more beautiful than ever.

277
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:59,054
[scoffs] Oh, what do you know?

278
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,391
It was a pretty great night
we had together, huh?

279
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:03,850
It was.

280
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:09,564
Say, did you ever hear the story
of the couple who moved to California?

281
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:11,108
I can't say that I have.

282
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,734
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

283
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,361
You see, they hardly knew each other,

284
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:17,614
but they shared a certain sensitivity
and a taste for the unknown.

285
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,117
They were living in a one-horse town,
so they headed west,

286
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,036
towards a town that could
accommodate three horses.

287
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,705
Oh, yes, I think I have heard this story.

288
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:29,042
They got a small house
in San Francisco near the bookstore.

289
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,378
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti
and his scurry.

290
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,130
He wrote his Great American Novel...

291
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,215
While his wife took care of the baby.

292
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:39,177
His wife?
Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.

293
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:41,346
Well, if she'd have him.

294
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,142
If a beautiful creature like herself
could ever love an oaf like him.

295
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,269
- I think she could.
- Yeah?

296
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,229
And isn't that how the story goes?

a nanny and a maid.

310
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:28,059
Well, if Squirrelinghetti
and his horde of commie, liberal,

311
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:30,228
Jew-loving rejects
knew what good writing was,

312
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,605
I'd be able to sell something.

313
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,274
Oh, so they're all wrong,
and you're right.

314
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,859
- [baby wails]
- [both groan]

315
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,946
Why won't you just take
that corner office job at Sugarman West

316
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,699
instead of breaking your back
all day at the cannery,

317
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:45,952
and then maybe you could afford me
some decent help around here?

318
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,830
You want me to work for your father,
and get paid for it,

319
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,373
like some sort of slave?

320
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,418
- That is the opposite of slavery.
- Is it?

321
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:56,838
Yes, it is!
You have no facility for language.

322
00:14:56,922 --> 00:15:00,091
- [baby crying]
- Oh, will you at long last be quiet?

323
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:02,344
You wanted that baby.
Never forget that.

324
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,596
I need quiet!

325
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,139
[crying continues]

326
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:10,727
[groans] You'd better be worth all this.

327
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,521
[crying]

328
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:17,108
- Well, you're not.
- I'm not what?

329
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,653
Mommy's tired, BoJack.
Tell me a story.

330
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,155
- [stammers] Oh, once upon a time...
- [door opens]

331
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,032
- [door slams]
- Quiet. Your father's home.

332
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,368
How was work, darling?

333
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,870
Ugh! Terrible.
Those fish do not like being canned.

334
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:31,623
Well, I burnt dinner, again.

335
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:33,834
But you can pick
at the charred remains

336
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,044
and delight me and your simple son

337
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,797
with stories of your noble,
salt-of-the-earth co-workers

338
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,384
like Eight-Finger Joe
and Sports-Team Steve...

339
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:43,927
- Oh, God.
- Before locking yourself

340
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,804
- in your study for the night...
- Know what?

341
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:49,349
To chip away at your
never-ending goddamn novel.

342
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,642
I'll clean up the kitchen,

343
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,936
- and bathe our filthy child.
- If you could just...

344
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,145
And we'll just keep waltzing

345
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,725
- through this goddamn...
- Would you...

346
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,440
- proletariat dream.
- No...

347
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,985
Maybe if the goddamn baby
wasn't crying all the time,

348
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,778
I could finish the goddamn novel.

349
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,363
I'm not a baby. I'm six.

350
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,323
Yes, wah, wah, ga, ga, goo, goo.

351
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:06,950
I'm forming sentences.

352
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,077
Oh, and I can't? Everyone's a critic.

353
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,453
I can see the headline now,

354
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,874
"Idiot Son Thinks Dad's Book is Great,
comma, Son is Idiot."

355
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,584
I didn't say your book is great.

356
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,835
I can't live like this!

357
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,045
I should have married
Corbin Creamerman.

358
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,547
Ha! Like he'd have you.

359
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,008
Oh, he would have.
And he would have been kind to me.

360
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:26,052
And he wouldn't have been
too much of a stubborn ass

361
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:28,763
to take a decent job
at my father's company!

362
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:32,058
Fine! I'll take the corner office,
with the company car, six-figure salary,

363
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,393
and four weeks paid vacation,

364
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:36,021
but if my novel becomes bad
because I no longer remember

365
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:39,316
what it's like to be working class,
we'll know of whom to be blamed.

366
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,777
- [door slams]
- Oh.

367
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,404
[classical music plays]

368
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,947
A little to the left. Good choice.

369
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,199
Just over... Careful with that.
That looks great.

370
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,035
Hello? You're always in the way.

371
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:51,322
- Why don't you go play?
- Okay.

372
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:52,529
- Go do something.
- Bye, Mom.

373
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,247
You are fired. Vacuum.
Thank you. Stat.

374
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,707
Goodbye. Thank you.

375
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,919
Henrietta, will you help me pack this?
I want to bring it to my son.

376
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,463
[laughs] Oh, that's so nice.
I love a good painting.

377
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:04,257
It's like TV without all the talking
and movement.

378
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,134
Jesus, what is that ghastly thing?

379
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:07,761
It belonged to Father.

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,888
I'm giving it to BoJack.

381
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,641
I never cared for the aesthetic arts.
Dulls the senses.

382
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,810
Art should be straightforward
and utilitarian, like my novel.

383
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:16,978
I can't wait to read it.

384
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,856
Books are fantastic.
The words tell stories.

385
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,817
- Henrietta, the painting.
- Right away, Mrs. Horseman.

386
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,611
I shouldn't have to ask you twice.

387
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,822
God gave you two ears
and me only the one mouth, after all.

388
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,661
- You could be nicer to her.
- No one's ever nice to me.

389
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:34,454
- Why should I be nice?
- Beatrice...

390
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:37,415
Just because the maid
bats her little eyes at you

391
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:40,251
and makes barely-qualifying-
for-conversation conversation,

392
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,712
doesn't mean I'm so easily seduced.

393
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,464
I don't know
what you're insinuating. I...

394
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:48,385
Oh, I'm sure she makes you feel
like a big smart man,

395
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,011
never challenges you,

396
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:53,390
and thanks you for helping her
study for nursing school.

397
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,517
As a matter of fact,
she is studying for nursing.

398
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,228
I know. I can hear
your flirting through the wall,

399
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,730
when you're supposedly
"working on your novel."

400
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,654
I bet you think
she's falling in love with you.

401
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:06,903
You sensitive, misunderstood artist.
Ugh. Won't she be disappointed.

402
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,114
I don't know why you don't
just get a divorce already.

403
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:10,907
Oh, sure, that's the Hollywood way.

404
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,711
"We're out of mustard.
Let's get a divorce!"

405
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,327
"I'm a little sad. Divorce!"

406
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,745
"We've grown apart over the years

407
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,629
and our adult child
has moved out of the house

408
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,333
and there's no reason for us
to stay together. Divorce!"

409
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,171
That actually is a legitimate reason
to get a divorce.

410
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:26,339
Well, who else would have me now?
After what you did to my body?

411
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,967
- What I did?
- Anyway, do you want this painting?

412
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,429
It belonged to your grandfather,
a man who knew what marriage meant.

413
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,097
[muffled dialogue]

414
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,056
Sure.

415
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,933
I drove it all the way down here,
didn't I?

416
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,013
- You might as well take it.
- I said I'll take it.

417
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,022
Of course. Take.
That's all you ever do.

418
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,649
How long you sticking around for, Mom?

419
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,776
[sighs] Just pour me a drink
and I'll be on my way.

420
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,738
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up
before you drive up the coast.

421
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:52,032
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.

422
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,200
She was the good one?
I always get them confused.

423
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,869
I heard your show was canceled.

424
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,163
Three years ago now.
You're really on the pulse, huh?

425
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,831
I never understood the appeal.

426
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:03,376
- It's just a bunch of silly stories.
- Some people like silly stories.

427
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,128
Lotta good they ever did me.

428
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,337
It's not Ibsen, but...

429
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:09,924
It would only depress me
to watch you bumble around like that.

430
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:14,012
All the sacrifices I made,
so that you could do this.

431
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:17,348
Thanks for the painting.

432
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:20,432
It'll be nice to have something that
always reminds me of this conversation.

433
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,232
[screams]

434
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,942
[screaming]

435
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,576
[clearing throat]

436
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,620
- Uh, Beatrice.
- What?

437
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,497
I, uh...
[clears throat]

438
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,541
- I gummed things up. [nervous chuckle]
- Oh?

439
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,168
It's Henrietta.

440
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,961
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

441
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,506
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

442
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,549
Can you talk to her?
Just woman to woman?

443
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:54,344
She wants to have the baby.
I... I can't talk her out of it.

444
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,097
- What do you want me to say?
- I'm out of options, Bea.

445
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,766
You think I enjoy groveling
to my own wife, hat in hand?

446
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,352
If you weren't so neglectful
in your wifely duties...

447
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,021
- Don't you dare.
- I'm sorry. What do...

448
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,648
I don't know what to do. I...

449
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:09,984
Please. Just...
Just fix this for me, please.

450
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:16,157
I know you hate me, Bea,
but please just think of the poor girl.

451
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:20,286
[exhales] Oh, God.

452
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:24,582
You're fired, of course.

453
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,001
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

454
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,587
He was just so kind to me
and I felt so...

455
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:32,757
Let me guess, he said you reminded him
of his dead mother.

456
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:37,011
He said she had hair like mine.
He saw it in a picture once.

457
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,388
[sighs]

458
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,850
- Do you really want this child?
- I... I think so?

459
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,644
It's a baby horse.
[chuckles] A girl.

460
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:45,979
[sighs]

461
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:50,525
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,
and tuition keeps going up.

462
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,235
None of that is my fault.

463
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,072
If I can just finish school
and get a job, it'll be okay.

464
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,575
And who's going to care
for the baby while you work?

465
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,243
Because God knows he won't.

466
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,662
[sobbing]

467
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,956
Well, don't do that.
What does that solve?

468
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,917
I don't know what else to do,
Mrs. Horseman.

469
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:11,212
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

470
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:13,631
- Really?
- Yes.

471
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:16,134
And you'll give the baby up
for adoption.

472
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,343
[gasps]

473
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,595
No.

474
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,930
You think you want this,
but you don't. Not like this.

475
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,056
Mrs. Horseman...

476
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,309
Don't throw away your dreams
for this child.

477
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:27,604
Don't let that man poison your life
the way he did mine.

478
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,315
You are going to finish your schooling
and become a nurse.

479
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:32,598
You'll meet a man, a good man,
and you'll have a family,

480
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,278
but please believe me,
you don't want this.

481
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,197
Oh...

482
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,282
Please, Henrietta,
you have to believe me.

483
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,243
Please, don't do what I did.

484
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,039
Mm-hmm.

485
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,291
[panting and grunting]

486
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,751

[screaming]

489
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,508
My... My baby!
Where's my baby?

490
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:59,177
[screaming]

491
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,678

[sighs]

495
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:11,105
- Oh, look at you.
- [chuckles]

496
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,816
- You did it, Henrietta.
- [panting]

497
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,235
Oh, my God.

498
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:18,196
[humming]

499
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,741
No, no, no. No, please.

500
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,409
Please don't. Stop.

501
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:26,037
Stop! Why are you doing this?

502
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,706
Beatrice, remember
what we say about crying?

503
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,541
- Mm-hmm.
- Crying is stupid.

504
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,002
But, Father,
tell them not to burn my things.

505
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:36,839
But, darling, they have to.
Your sickness has infected everything.

506
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,549
The hard part is over.

507
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,593
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

508
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,470
- No. You'll get attached.
- Wait!

509
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:45,181
It all must be destroyed
for your own good.

510
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,350
- I need to hold her.
- This is for your own good.

511
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,478
- But not my baby.
- Yes. Especially your baby.

512
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,729
- Whoop!
- [gasps]

513
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:53,013
See, doesn't that feel better?

514
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:55,817
[Beatrice cries] No!

515
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,443
My baby!

516
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,112
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

517
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,363
- No, no.
- [crying]

518
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,949
Wait. No, please come back.
I need to hold her. Please.

519
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,575
[screams]

520
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:05,910
No!

521
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,787
Come on now, be strong.

522
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,331
You can't let your womanly emotions
consume you.

523
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:12,875
You don't wanna end up
like your mother now, do you?

524
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,585
[faint screaming in distance]

525
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,713
- [sobs] No.
- I promise.

526
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:20,717
One day this will
all be a pleasant memory.

527
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,852
Best of luck. See ya never.

528
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,231
- Who is that?
- [groans] Bye, Mom.

529
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,400
BoJack?

530
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,653
- Mom?
- BoJack? Is that you?

531
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:42,113
Yeah, it's me.

532
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:46,284
- Well, oh, what is this place?
- This is where you live now.

533
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,911
- No. Is it? No.
- Mom...

534
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,830
- Where are we, BoJack?
- I just told you.

535
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,040
I don't understand.

536
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:54,292
- Where... Where am I?
- You're...

537
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:57,545
in Michigan.

538
00:23:57,628 --> 00:23:59,797
- Michigan?
- Yeah.

539
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:02,008
- At the lake house.
- I am?

540
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,719
It's a... It's a warm summer night,

541
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:08,306
and the fireflies are dancing
in the sky.

542
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:11,350
And your whole family is here.

543
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,228
And they're telling you
that everything is gonna be all right.

544
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:17,899
Yes. That's right. What else?

545
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:22,612
The crickets are... are chirping,
and the lake is still,

546
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,698
and the night is full of stars.

547
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,743
I can see it. It's so clear.

548
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:31,120
What are we doing here, BoJack?

549
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,497
We're sitting on the back porch,

550
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,458
and we're listening to your brother
play the piano,

551
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,293
and we're eating ice cream.

552
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:38,961
Vanilla ice cream.

553
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,089
Yes. That's right.

554
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:43,966
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

555
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,760
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

556
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:47,762
Oh, BoJack.

557
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:50,098
It's so...

558
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,925
delicious.
