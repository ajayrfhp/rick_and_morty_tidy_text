00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,428
Oh, great, well, that's a relief.

156
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,430
Uh, should you be taking all those pills?

157
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,057
It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

158
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:43,268
- I got it from a doctor.
- Your doctor or just a doctor?

159
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,270
I don't know, some doctor, okay?

160
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,523
I met him at Adam Levine's Halloween party.

161
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:50,860
- I think he said his name was Dr. Who.
- Yeah, I don't think that was...

162
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:53,737
Ohh, God damn.

163
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,281
Uh, are you supposed to
be snorting it like that?

164
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,993
Ugh! What are you, the
paramedic who restarted

165
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:01,286
my heart at Adam
Levine's Halloween party?

166
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,497
Okay, so before we put to bed the whole

167
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,000
- you going to rehab thing...
- BoJack, all my life,

168
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,711
I've never been forced to
confront my problems head on.

169
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:13,423
No one has ever said "no"
to me, ever, so is it cool

170
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,551
if instead of confronting
my problems head on,

171
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,054
I just hide out here for a little bit?

172
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,388
Sarah Lynn, I hear what you're saying,

173
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,973
and I think I know what you need.

174
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:24,608
You just need a strong,
responsible adult to say:

175
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:27,298
"Yes. Yes, you can move in with me."

176
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,190
This is gonna be fun.
Hey, everyone,

00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:30,816

180
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:41,160
- I do! I do!
- Uh, what's going on in here?

181
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:43,954
Morning, sleepy-pooh, you want pancakes?

182
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,831
Yeah, that sounds great.

183
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,708
Ooh, tough break, champ.
I just gave the last one

184
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,044
to Sarah Lynn.
Early bird gets the worm.

185
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,671
More like early turd gets the sperm.

186
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:56,092
Wha... "Early turd gets the
sperm," nice one, Sarah Lynn.

187
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,885
You should do a Shouts and Murmurs.

188
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,511
Help yourself to some
cold wheat bran, sport.

189
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,264
Ugh.

190
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,806
Thanks for letting me crash here, BoJack.

191
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,850
The guest room is yours
as long as you want.

192
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:06,518
You have a guest room?

193
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:09,272
Why have I been sleeping
on the couch for five years?

194
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,190
You'll get the guest room when
you've earned the guest room.

195
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,734
These pancakes are so good.

196
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:17,113
All Andrew ever wanted
to eat was stupid lasagna.

197
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:21,366
- Andrew Garfield loves lasagna?
- I don't want to talk about him!

198
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,744
BoJack, can you drive me to the mall today?

199
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:26,997
I really want to go shopping,
but I'm not allowed to drive

200
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,000
because somebody got a DUI.

201
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,129
Uh, that somebody was you, right?

202
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,081
I don't have to answer your
questions! What are you, the

203
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:39,051
cop that pulled me over after
Adam Levine's Halloween party?

204
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:42,346
Honey, do you really think
going to the mall's a good idea?

205
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,223
I seem to recall another
time you went shopping

206
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:47,392
when things got pretty out of control.

207
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:51,188
Oh, that's too much, man!

Not the time when she gored herself

210
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,070
with a bayonet and shat on a floor model?

211

Hey, I'm not the crazy one.

212
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:01,573
Andrew's the one who flies off the handle

213

whenever his agent sets
up an audition on a Monday.

214
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:08,872
Andrew Garfield hates
Mondays and loves lasagna?

215
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,249
I said I don't want to talk about it!

216
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,708
- She said drop it, Todd!
- Whatever,

217
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,460
I don't want to go to the stupid mall.

218
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,045
I'll just tell my friends to come here.

219
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,006
Muffin, I've got to work on my book today,

220
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,509
and I can't have a bunch of folks over
making a lot of noise.

00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:23,762
Oh, I see. I'm a burden to you.

222
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,265
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

223
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:30,019
I'm no longer cute, so I have
nothing to offer this world.

224
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,646
Honey, of course your friends
are always welcome here.

00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,690
Cool. Bye.

- No.

You let that basket case into your house?

228
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,049
That girl is a PR hurricane
that you don't need right now.

229
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,260
She has nowhere else to turn.
She broke up with her boyfriend.

230
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:48,721
She stabbed herself and closed
the wound with duct tape.

231
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:49,972
- She fired her agent.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,557
Back it up, horsey.

doesn't have an agent?

I'm looking for a new client?

Your Ari Emanuels and Vanessa
Geckos and what have you.

253

Vanessa Gecko is actually Andrew's
agent, and she's really great.

254
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,418
Is she? [chuckles]
I've heard that.

I didn't realize you
were so into house music.

256
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,885
Look, I asked her to turn
it down, but apparently,

257
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,887
this volume was prescribed by Dr. Who

258
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:15,308
to treat something called
"uptight dickhead disease."

259
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,810
What do you... What do
you think about Sarah Lynn?

260
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:20,229
Oh, I don't really think
about her all that much.

261
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,648
I mean, obviously, I'm
a fan of her early work

262
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:25,252
which both satirized and
celebrated youth culture's

263
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:28,112
obsession with sex, but I do
wonder as a third-wave feminist

264
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,864
if it's even possible for
women to reclaim their sexuality

265
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,908
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

266
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,869
or if claiming to do so is
just a lie we tell ourselves

267
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,830
so we can more comfortably
cater to the male gaze.

268
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,665
- Uh, what?
- But you know,

269
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,417
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one

270
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,544
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

271
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,380
- That's my same worry.
- ... incapable of engaging

272
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,715
- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.

273
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,093
... and infantilization,
which is itself a product

274
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,427
- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.

275
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,513
... society we live in.
But like I said,

276
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:56,307
I don't really think
about her all that much.

277
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,684
Okay, well, that is very interesting,

278
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,144
but I was more asking,

279
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,895
like, what do you think
about her living here?

280
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:06,150
Oh, right.
Well, what was your relationship like

281
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,027
with her when you were working on the show?

282
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,945
It was very good, very professional.

283
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,366
BoJack, where did you go to college?

284
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,951
- Don't bother him, honey.
- Oh, it's no problem.

285
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:19,163
Honey, college is for ugly
people who can't tap dance.

286
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:22,457
- I want to be an architect.
- [laughing] Sweetheart,

287
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,444

could be an architect.

289
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,881
- Aw.
- All right,

290
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,175
- take it sleazy, everybody.
- Wait, BoJack,

291
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:33,802
um, what are you doing this weekend?

292
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,368
I don't know. I'll probably
just go to the amusement park,

293
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,849
maybe the circus, fly a kite
on the beach, watch the sunset,

294
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,393
then I'll head back to my place

295
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,019
to watch any number of
Disney princess movies

296
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,063
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.

297
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,316
Whoa, that sounds like so much fun.
Can I come?

298
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,818
[laughing] Yeah, like I
want to spend my weekend

299
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:53,280
hanging out with a little girl.
[laughing] Good one!

300
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,199
You should write for
the Shouts and Murmurs.

301
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,450
See you Monday!

302
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,551
So the makeup they
were putting on you was

303
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,662
not for the show, it
was just for the weekend?

304
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:03,916
- Why does that matter?
- I'm just trying to understand the story.

305
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,959
Do you think it's possible
that you inviting Sarah Lynn

way of compensating for not...

No, Diane, I'm just helping out a friend.

308
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,592
I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,

309
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,262
or resolve a deep guilt for past neglect,

310
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,972
or even try to retroactively
fix my own childhood

311
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,016
by recreating someone else's,

312
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,311
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

[slurps]
Okay.

What happened?

315
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,524
Did somebody hurt my precious baby?

Oh, hey, BoJack.

318
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,614
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

319
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,783
a sweet cocaine booth/sex closet.

- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

Oof. Way to harsh the vibe, Kissinger.

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

I thought this was a place where Sarah Lynn

324
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,338
could finally be Sarah Lynn, but I guess...

325
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:56,218
- that's too much, man.
- I always loved that catch phrase.

Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

332

You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

Only I can call a house meeting.

You can propose a house meeting.

All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

336
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:25,705
- this house meeting...
- Your proposal has been

337
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,958
submitted and is under board review.

338

- Proposal denied.
- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thing

339
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,839
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

340
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,550
What? No she's not. We
have a special relationship.

341
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,302
You couldn't possibly understand.

Oh, my God. Look at what
she's done to your house.

343
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,639
All right, look, I mean, I
stepped on a needle earlier.

344
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,224
I think I'm addicted to heroin now,

345
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,685
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

346
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,603
I have to say, I agree with Todd.

347
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,230
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,483
any favors by refusing to set boundaries.

349
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,860
Look, I played a dad for nine years on TV,

350
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:56,862
so I think I know a little
bit more about parenting

The kids on Horsin' Around

All they needed was some

BoJack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

This is real life.

Ah! Lemur on fire! Lemur on fire!

357
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,840
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

358
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:21,387
I'm gonna give it to her so... hard.

359

You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

setting over those two hills

made me think of a big
ass, and that made me think

of ass cancer, and that made me think

00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,848
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

457
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:36,182
Please don't do this.
[both moaning]

458
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,435
No, no. Why are you...
[both moaning]

459
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,312
[whinnies]
This is a very bad idea.

460
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:42,021
[both moaning]
Can I at least get my blanket...

461
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,607
let me get my blanket out from under...

462
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,317
Oh G...
Oh, my God, my arm.

463
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,985
- You got my arm.
- [laughs] Ow! Ow!

464
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,404
I'm in it now. Oh, God,
no! I'm a part of it.

465
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:50,739
[both moaning]

466
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,161
I still haven't regained
the feeling in my fingers.

467
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,163
That was the longest
two minutes of my life.

468
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,874
Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.

469
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,459
It was longer than two minutes.

470
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,504
How do you not get that this is terrible?

471
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,255
Oh, you mean from a P.R. standpoint?

472
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,175
Yeah, 'cause if this got
out, oh, I would get flayed!

473
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:13,386
Oh, I'm done being the voice of reason.

474
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,098
It's exhausting. I got
to take an angry nap.

475
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:19,518
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

476
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,978
I know. I know. She's
taking advantage of me.

477
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,730
Actually, it kind of
feels like you're the one

478
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,440
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

479
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:27,942
with substance abuse
problems and daddy issues.

480
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:29,736
Hey, we both have substance abuse problems

481
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,905
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came

482
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:34,949
to you for help.
[sighs]

483
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:37,952
Hey, notice how I've been ignoring you,

484
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:40,413
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

485
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:42,123
Ugh. Go stand on the
other side of the room.

486
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,125
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

487
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,336
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

488
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,588
I was gonna keep hanging
out here if that's all right.

489
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,757
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

490
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,592
This place isn't good for you.

491
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,470
You need to go where you
can get help, real help.

492
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:57,723
But I thought you were
always gonna be there for me

493
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:58,973
like you said.

494
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:01,685
I will always be there for you.

495
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,395
<i>Cut, let's take ten.</i>

496
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:06,314
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

497
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,566
These pages are shit.
[coughs]

498
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,150
you understand? Shit.

499
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,819
I wouldn't wipe my ass with these pages.

500
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:12,571
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

501
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,406
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

502
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:16,032
You get me points on the back end?

503
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,785
[coughs] Well, I told you I'm not
gonna do it unless I get points.

504
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,370
Oh, they can't find any?

505
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,663
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

506
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,039
[coughs]
I'm on the phone.

507
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,000
You're being very rude.
[laughs]

508
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:28,211
You promised me you would always be there.

509
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,630
Sarah Lynn, this is for your own good.

510
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,298
You can't stay here anymore.

511
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:35,027
Okie-doke. I guess I'll
just move out and find one of

512
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:37,721
the billion people who will
let me party at their house.

513
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:40,557
Uh, well, you should not do that.

514
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,268
Oh, I know.
I know, but I can, so I will.

515
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,186
I'm at a place right now where I never need

516
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,106
to grow as a person or rise to an occasion

517
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,692
because I can constantly
just surround myself

518
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,278
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

519
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:58,241
- Wh-What?
- Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.

520
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:01,160
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

521
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,914
Oh, by the way, I called Vanessa Gecko,

522
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:05,582
and I'm meeting with her tomorrow.

523
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:08,293
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

524
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,504
Hey, you guys want to
hear my new catchphrase?

525
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:15,300
Suck a dick, dumb shits!
[blows raspberry]

526
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:17,343
[grunting]

527
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:20,179
Laura, the dummy took the
bait. Now for phase two.

528
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:23,976
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

529
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:26,060
Leak to the trades that
Andrew Garfield's agent

530
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:29,063
is taking meetings with his
ex, get it all over town,

531
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:30,983
wait an hour, then get me lunch with Andrew

532
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:34,694
on the books for this
weekend, someplace Italian.

533
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:36,446
I really blew it, didn't I?

534
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,907
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

535
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:41,910
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

536
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:44,037
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

537
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,808
So what you're saying is:

538
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,768
Everything is society's
fault, and we as individuals

539
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,336
never need to take
responsibility for anything?

540
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,006
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that...

541
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:56,591
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

542
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,259
because I can't do anything wrong

543
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:00,053
because we're all just
products of our environment,

544
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,346
bouncing around like marbles

545
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:02,806
in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos

546
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,516
that is our random and cruel universe.

547
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,225
Wait, no, that's not
even what I'm saying...

548
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,854
Yeah, It's not my fault. It's society.

549
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,439
Everything is because of society!

550
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,733
- BoJack, that...
- Dude, just let him have this.

551
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:16,152
Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!

552
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,989
<i>Nothing I do has consequence!</i>

553
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:25,453
- So what'd you get, anything good?
- Oh, I got everything.

554
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:29,290
[both laugh]

555
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,669
