it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.

152
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,404
Wha...? That's so weird.
You must have dialed it wrong.

153
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,700
And then I thought, well, you know,
sooner or later you'd call me.

154
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:41,704
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,
but then, you know, 9/11 happened...

155
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:44,415
- Can you ever forgive me?
- I think so.

156
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,668
Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?
Please come in.

157
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,547
And that was just such
a tough time for our country...

158
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:57,970
So, once we introduced vicious knife-play
into our routine,

159
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,931
it really gave our sex life the edge.

160
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,057
Love it, crooshed it.

161
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:05,269
So the article is just about
a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?

162
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,480
We already have Raquel's piece
about 69 days of sixty-nining.

163
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:09,565
- Uh-huh!
- So croosh.

164
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,651
What about our readers
who aren't having sex with their husbands?

165
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,486
Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?

166
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,906
Not everyone gets to have
great sex all the time, right?

167
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,616
Ladies?

168
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,162
Diane? Can I talk to you
in your office for a minute?

169
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,330
I don't have an office.

170
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,957
You said offices have corners
and corners are the patriarchy.

171
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,753
Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,
cool-down yoga area?

172
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,590
[deep breathing]

173
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:35,674
You seem tense.

174
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,844
Have you been eating gluten
and also not having sex with your husband?

175
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,220
Whoa, Stefani, that's not...

176
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:45,768
Diane, relax! This is not a conversation
between an employee and her superior.

177
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:50,105
This is a conversation
between a friend and her superior.

178
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,150
The campaign
has been testing our marriage.

179
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,819
Obviously, it's great to see
Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,

180
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,571
and I am supporting that.

181
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:58,739
But if I'm being honest,

182
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:01,617
I can't wait for it to be over
so things can go back to normal.

183
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,703
- Hmm. And what happens if he wins?
- He's not going to win.

184
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:07,164
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?

185
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,917
He could win. People do love fracking.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,921
It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!
Fricky-fricky-frack" [laughs]

187
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,424
People wouldn't love saying it
if they understood what it actually was.

188
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,927
- So tell them.
- I can't go against my husband.

189
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,930
What the frack? Why not?
You gotta do you, girl.

190
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:25,599
I always say, you gotta do you.

191
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:28,769
And if he's doing him,
then who's doing you?

192
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:32,106
Because right now,
it seems like no one's doing you.

193
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,357
[groans]

194
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,944
and then when I was eight,

195
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:40,197
Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all
Freaky Friday for a sleepover,

196
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,576
and I got really sad because I realized
I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.

197
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,745
Am I talking a lot?
I feel I'm talking a lot.

198
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,831
- Yes.
- Oh! I need to show you something.

199
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:51,291
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

200
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,086
but I was so head over heels
in love with your father

201
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:57,381
that after we made sweet love,
and he didn't call me again,

202
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,176
I just got so jealous, so I made a list
of every girl he was with...

203
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,220
and I found their home addresses...

204
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,514
- Oh.
- And drew Xs over their eyes.

205
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:09,810
I'm loving this conversation
but I have to go the bathroom now,

206
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:14,731
for non-me being weirded out
by this conversation-related reasons.

207
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,734
I just keep thinking about
how different things would have been

208
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,111
if you'd have just called me.

209
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:23,073
We could have had a family together
for 18 loving years.

210
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,797
- That might have...
- [Hollyhock] BoJack!

211
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,326
[groans] Kids. What?

212
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,412
Can you join me
in the bathroom for a minute?

213
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,496
What?! No!

214
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,292
- Do you want me, sweetheart?
- No, it's a dad bathroom thing.

215
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,545
Uh... Hollyhock?

216
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,590
That woman is not my mother.
She's lying to us!

217
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,799
Marcy? No way!

218
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:43,594
Look. This is from the premiere
of Autumn in New York.

219
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:47,723
That movie came out in August of 2000.
I was born in September.

220
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,058
Does this woman look
eight months pregnant to you?

221
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,604
Why would they release a romantic drama
called Autumn in New York

222
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,771
in the middle of summer?

223
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,899
Richard Gere
had just done Runaway Bride,

224
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:59,193
Winona Ryder was hot off
Girl, Interrupted

225
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,653
- so the studio got cocky.
- How do you know all this?

226
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:04,323
I looked it up on the Internet
because I saw this picture

227
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:07,242
and got confused why Marcy
would wear a summer dress

228
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,369
to a movie called
Autumn in New York.

229
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,997
This is a summer dress?
I guess I don't know dresses.

230
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,583
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!

231
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,437
So the lesson here is
I was right to never call her.

232
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,499
- Wait, so who...
- [Marcy] Are you okay in there?

233
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,673
- Don't come in!
- Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!

234
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:25,302
The scrapbook! She has that list
of all the other women you slept with.

235
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,679
If we get the book, we can find my mom.

236
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:31,225
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,
then you sneak in and grab the book.

237
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,270
[BoJack] Okay.

238
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:38,357
And what was the first appearance
of the Horse's identical cousin?

239
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,692
[Marcy] Season eight, episode four.

240
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:44,947
[BoJack] Yeah, yeah. That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name?

241
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,074
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God!

242
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,951
You're not supposed to see this.
Look away!

243
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,703
It's okay, Hollyhock.
This is what Mommy and Daddy do.

244
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:55,332
- Ugh! You said give you a few minutes!
- I didn't think it would take this long.

245
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,583
I usually finish faster.

246
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,670
- You're disgusting!
- [moans] That's what I needed.

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,594
- Can I please have a grasshopper?
- [seductively] Yes?

248
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,430
So the studio finished Mars Attacks!
Without him.

249
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,432
And since no one ever found a body,

250
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,935
my client Tony Tromboni
has been making movies

251
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,813
- under the name Tim Burton ever since.
- Oh!

252
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,439
- [chiming]
- I'm Harvey Fierstein.

253
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:23,902
Your ovulation window is closing soon.
Please commence copulation.

254
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,404
Oh, fish! We gotta go.

255
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,489
- Can't we finish lunch?
- You heard the bracelet.

256
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,052
Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.

257
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,827
- There's no time for that! Ralph!
- We gotta pay for our...

258
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,955
I have an egg inside me
that is ripe to be fertilized.

259
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,748
His name is Philbert.

260
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:39,251
- Princess Carolyn...
- Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,

261
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:43,547
and he's going to be sweet and smart
and a phenom on the clarinet,

262
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,717
and one day you'll be driving him home
from band practice

263
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,679
and he's going to all of a sudden
say something so insightful and true

264
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:55,475
that you'll be positively floored
it came out of the mouth of your son.

265
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,520
But if you don't take me home right now
and impregnate me,

266
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,939
- then Philbert will never exist.
- [plates clatter]

267
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,774
Okay, let's go.

268
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,113
- You told me to distract her.
- We don't need to talk about it.

269
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:11,116
So now that we got the list,
we gotta go see all these other women?

270
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,618
Not all of them,
just the ones you didn't see

271
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:16,246
in the nine months
after you had sex with them.

272
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,332
- That's gonna be most of them.
- Yeah, figures.

273
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:19,541
Ooh!

274
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:24,588
Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium,
Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS?

275
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,965
I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium?

276
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,091
She's a medium,

277
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,761
but she can also travel through time
and she solves crimes.

278
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:34,014
That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium?

279
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,434
But the one crime she can't solve
is her husband's murder.

280
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,894
[groans]

281
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,771
[sitar playing]

282
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:45,359
So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples
but hate applesauce, too slimy.

283
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,277
I was the captain of the JV soccer team...

284
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:51,490
BoJack, why did you bring this child
into my sanctum?

285
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,699
I can make this real quick.

286
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:54,826
Did you give up my secret baby
in the year 2000?

287
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,788
Oh, BoJack, do you recall
the impetus for our uncoupling?

288
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,915
Is every one of these
gonna be a whole thing?

289
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:01,833
You were a cad and a boor.

290
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:08,507
But your fits of sardonic japery amused,
to a point, until you impregnated me.

291
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,885
Suddenly, I was awash in dreams
of idealized domesticity.

292
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:14,596
But when I told you I was with child,

293
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,766
I received a check in the mail
for $200 with the memo line,

294
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,185
"BoJack's half of the abortion."

295
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,728
So you put me up for adoption?

296
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,689
Child, no. I had the abortion.

297
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,441
Nice. You don't want
any little BoJacks floating around.

298
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,563
Last thing this world needs
is more of this garbage.

299
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,822
- Uh, excuse me?
- No, you're great, you seem cool,

300
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,408
but if we could go back in time
and prevent it...

301
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:35,492
- Right?
- [groans]

302
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,868
Hollyhock, I didn't mean...

303
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:42,624
By the way, your show sucks.
Should be called Tedium.

304
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,068
- [tires screeching]
- [horn honks]

305
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,168
[chiming]

306
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,631
Your uterus contains the secrets of life,
the ability to create.

307
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,591
- Go, go! Oh, God!
- I'm going!

308
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:55,345
At this point, your ovum has burst out
of the swollen follicle,

309
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,557
traveled down the long gentle river
of the fallopian tube,

310
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,978
and been welcomed by the warm embrace
of the silk-lined uterus.

311
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,062
No, no, no.

312
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:08,692
You must fertilize that precious ovum now
or it will disintegrate into nothingness.

313
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,069
Hit the gas! Do it for Philbert!

314
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,114
[siren blaring]

315
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:17,033
- Pull over your vehicle, now!
- [groans]

316
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,827
Oh, fish!

317
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:23,457
So in conclusion, I don't think California
is the greatest state in the country.

318
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,834
But it can be.

319
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:29,087
Beautifully put.
I'd like to drill down, as it were,

320
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:31,715
- on the subject of fracking.
- Drill away.

321
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,634
Now, mere hours ago
your wife, Diane Nguyen,

322
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,470
seen here eating a messy sandwich,

323
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:40,098
published an essay online
titled "The Case Against Fracking"

324
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,767
in which she posits, quote...

325
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,687
"If these frack-happy politicians
even knew how dangerous it was,

326
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:47,647
they wouldn't allow it
in their own backyards."

327
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,524
- Diane wrote that?
- Damn.

328
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:52,527
Mr. Peanutbutter,
your wife has issued a challenge.

329
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:55,739
Would you allow fracking
in your own backyard?

330
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,324
I would.

331
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,285
Joining us now via Periscope
is Frankie Flackery,

332
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:03,580
foreman and spokesyak
for Flackery Will Get You Everywhere

333
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,207
industrial drilling company.

334
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,543
- How are ya?
- Flackery Flack, let's talk frack.

335
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:12,172
Mr. Peanutbutter has invited you
to drill on his property.

336
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:14,508
- Uh...
- Will you take him up on this invitation?

337
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,552
- I could have a team there this afternoon.
- Oh...

338
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,513
Ready when you are, boys!

339
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,391
Sir, I apologize.
We are very eager to get home.

340
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:27,103
You were going 36 miles per hour.
The speed limit here...

341
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,605
is 35.

342
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,774
- Yes.
- Now, I'm no mathematician.

343
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,443
- I'm just a humble officer of the law.
- Okay.

344
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:38,365
So you tell me, is 36 below 35
or is it above 35?

345
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,283
Just write us a ticket and let us go.

346
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,328
Now, now, talking back
to Officer Meow Meow is a major no-no.

347
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,789
- [chiming]
- Hello! Harvey Fierstein here.

348
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,084
Oh! Who said that?
Is there another man in your vehicle?

349
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,669
- Hello?
- Show yourself, fiend!

350
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,546
We don't have time for this! I'm in heat!

351
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,214
Ma'am, you need to calm down!

352
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:56,883
Don't tell me to calm down
or call me ma'am!

353
00:16:56,967 --> 00:17:00,303
Just write us a goddamn ticket
so I can go home and mount my boyfriend!

354
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,348
That's enough!
Out of the car, all three of you!

355
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,270
Obviously, I didn't mean you.

356
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,021
You're giving me the silent treatment?

357
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:11,731
I guess I have thin skin.

358
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:14,276
Must be the half of me
that's made of garbage.

359
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,862
[sighs] Well, who else is on this list?

360
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:20,907
Stacy, Fabiana... Tonya Harding?
She is not gonna be happy to see me.

361
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,272
She said sleeping with me
is the worst thing she ever did.

362
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,954
I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you

363
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:28,707
to have to interact
with women you were shitty to.

364
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,584
I don't understand
why we're even doing this.

365
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,128
You're never gonna switch bodies
with your mom.

366
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:35,338
That ship has sailed
and is also impossible.

367
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,965
- Pull over the car.
- No.

368
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:39,050
- Pull over now!
- Jesus. Fine.

369
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:44,097
- I'm gonna do the rest of this on my own.
- No. Hollyhock.

370
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,268
I got the list. I don't need you anymore.
Have a bad life.

371
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,437
Joke's on you, I already have one!

372
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,318
Oh no. No. No, no.

373
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:58,653
Where's Mr. Peanutbutter?

374
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:01,531
He's giving a stump speech
on the subject of stumps.

375
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,492
- Turns out he's pro. Great for sitting.
- [groans]

376
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,078
I'd be careful with that faucet,
the water comes out very hot

377
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,163
because of the fracking.

378
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,082
Aaah! How could you let him do this?

379
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,376
You're the one who called his bluff.
Don't do that.

380
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,047
- This just makes my job harder.
- I didn't "call his bluff." I just...

381
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,176
Woman, you have one job:
be his wife, be supportive.

382
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,594
I am being supportive.

383
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:25,221
Was that you being supportive today
with that piece you wrote

384
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,516
- for your stupid girl website?
- It's called Girl Croosh.

385
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,103
"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection
of the main site.

386
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:35,106
And my piece wasn't about
Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.

387
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,187
I'm gonna cut this conversation short,
my time is more important than yours.

388
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,195
This goes one of two ways.

389
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,281
Either you shut up and be pretty,
or your approximation of that,

390
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,534
or don't support him, he resents you,
your marriage implodes.

391
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,161
- Pick your poison.
- Damn!

392
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:51,206
Not that I get to vote, but from
one Mrs. Peanutbutter to another,

393
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,251
it's been really fun for me
to watch this new marriage fall apart.

394
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,587
- We're not.
- So thank you, Diane,

395
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:01,383
for that tiny sliver of mint
in the smoothie of dogshit

396
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:04,427
that is trying to get
that popular idiot elected.

397
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,512
Good night.

398
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:08,515
Damn!

399
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:10,308
[blaring]

400
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,982
- [chiming]
- I'm Harvey Fierstein,

401
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,025
and I hope
you're almost done having sex

402
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,820
because your ovulation cycle
will soon be ending.

403
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:22,988
Huh.

404
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,532
I'm sorry we couldn't get home in time.

405
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:28,868
- Your lawyer, he's good?
- The best.

406
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,037
Then you know what we have to do?

407
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:32,163
Oh!

408
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:34,666
- For Philbert?
- For Philbert.

409
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,376
[grunting]

410
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,753
- What are you doing back there? Hey!
- [moaning]

411
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:42,090
- Sorry you have to be here for this.
- Keep your eyes on the road.

412
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:43,633
Hey! You two cut that out!

413
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:48,722
I'll write you up for lewd conduct.
Lewd, crude and partially nude!

414
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:52,517
Not to mention the rude 'tude
of you two dudes, while this prude...

415
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,680
- Hey, listen to me!
- Whoa!

416
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,896
[voice of Fierstein] And so the dance
of life continues apace.

417
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,108
I'm Harvey Fierstein,
bidding you a sexy good evening.

418
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:02,902
[Officer Fuzzyface] No!

419
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,237
Can I get my check now?

420
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,156
[sighs]

421
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,284
Alone, at last. Thank God.

422
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,124
[sighs]

423
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,210
[groans] Fine, fine, fine.

424
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,464
Hi, Fabiana. Before you slam the door...

425
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:25,800
Did a young horse girl come by here,
about yay high?

426
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:29,971
You're still mad about your dad's funeral?
That was 18 years ago!

427
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,057
Thank you, Tonya.
I know we've had our differences,

428
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,476
but seeing you always leaves me
weak in the knees.

429
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,226
[groans]

430
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,817
- [grunts]
- Hollyhock.

431
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,945
- Was that her?
- Ugh! No.

432
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,448
[groans]

433
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:52,660
I talked to 23 women today
and none of them were my mother.

434
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:55,413
- How did you find me?
- I went to everyone on that list.

435
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:57,957
You talked to all those women?
Some of them...

436
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,628
- Really haven't aged well, I know.
- I was gonna say, really hate you.

437
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:04,130
Oh, yeah, that too.
But I needed to find you.

438
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:05,965
To tell you I'm sorry,

439
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,635
for being such an asshole
then and also now.

440
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:12,055
This whole thing was stupid.
I never should have come out here.

441
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,808
And I don't even care
about having a mom, really.

442
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:18,103
Because I did fine
for 17 years without one.

443
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,979
I don't need a mom.

444
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,523
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.

445
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:26,945
No, it's not! Because that means my dads
weren't enough for me, and they are!

446
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,363
[sighs]

447
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,782
I know I just met you,
but if you do have

448
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:34,160
any of the old Horseman gunk
bouncing around in that brain of yours,

449
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:37,914
I gotta tell you right now
you should give up on looking for "enough"

450
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,375
because it will never be enough.

451
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,751
[whimpering]

452
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,586
- [sobbing]
- Eww!

453
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,548
- Stop that.
- I know, it's stupid.

454
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:51,970
- There, there.
- You are so bad at this.

455
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:53,930
What do your dads say when you cry?

456
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,349
They say it's okay to cry,

457
00:21:56,432 --> 00:22:00,103
and that I shouldn't feel bad
about feeling bad.

458
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,272
Well, that... that's good advice, right?

459
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:05,817
They're really good dads.
I should probably get back to them.

460
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,944
Oh. You don't have to leave right away.

461
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,988
Why don't you just
stay with me a bit longer?

462
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,447
At least until we find your mom.

463
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:15,451
How are we supposed to do that?
Every name on that list was a dead end.

464
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,287
Oh...

465
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,667
Yeah. But what if I told you
there's a name that isn't on that list?

466
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,294
Someone Marcy never knew about.

467
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,129
What? Where is she now?

468
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,257
I don't know. But you can stay with me
while we try to find her?

469
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,551
Okay. Yeah. What's her name?

470
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:35,388
Her name was Brown Car... la.

471
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,849
Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.

472
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:41,978
"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"?
Weird name.

473
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,606
- You've got a weird name.
- I guess you're right.

474
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:47,150
Maybe that's the first thing
we'll talk about when I meet her.

475
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,776
Mm-hmm?

476
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,072
[keyboard clicking]

477
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:57,160
Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,
but you didn't give me much choice.

478
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,413
I know these last few days
have been crazy.

479
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,207
- But this is the hard part.
- I need you to drop out of the race.

480
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,209
- What?
- Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.

481
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:06,294
This isn't worth it.

482
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:08,087
I hear what you're saying

483
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:11,716
and I will try to be more conscientious
of your needs.

484
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,046
- Drop out of the race.
- Because your needs are important.

485
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,095
I've written another piece
for Girl Croosh.

486
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,556
It's called
"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."

487
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,642
When I hit this button,
the post goes live.

488
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,809
Diane, don't.

489
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:25,438
I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

490
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,690
Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.

491
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:30,568
Because you're the only one allowed
to make decisions for this family?

492
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:33,321
No. Because it's gonna come off
as a weird lovers' spat

493
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:35,323
and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

494
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:38,785
- Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.
- Oh, come on.

495
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:41,120
You told me you weren't going to frack,
and now I can't

496
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:44,916
turn on a faucet in my own home
without getting third-degree burns.

497
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:48,378
Oh, I get it. So like always,
you're mad at someone,

498
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:52,674
so your solution is to air
your dirty laundry for everyone to see.

499
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:57,303
No. This is not about us.
I don't want you to be governor

500
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:01,641
because you would be bad at it,
because you don't stand for anything.
