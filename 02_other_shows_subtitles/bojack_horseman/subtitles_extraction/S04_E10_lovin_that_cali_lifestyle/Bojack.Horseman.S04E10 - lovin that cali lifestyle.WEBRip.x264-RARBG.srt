I don't need credit.

156
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,973
But it does, if I didn't do that,
it wouldn't have happened.

157
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,141
So, it's because of me.

158
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,727
- Well, whoever is responsible...
- Me. I just told you.

159
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,437
We shouldn't get too excited just yet.

160
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,149
The election is a week away,
and a lot can happen in a week.

161
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:46,151
This is far from over.

162
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:51,865
It's over. And the clear winner
is Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

163
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:53,450
- All right!
- Huzzah!

164
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:56,202
- We did it!
- High five! [laughs] Low five!

165
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,454
Shadow puppet!

166
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:58,872
Hand jive! Yes!

167
00:07:58,955 --> 00:07:59,998
[laughs]

168
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,875
- We did it, didn't we?
- We did!

169
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,587
You and me, working together,
both contributing the same amount.

170
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,923
Well, I wrote the article
that got Woodchuck elected governor.

171
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,468
You're the one that made him
not governor in the first place.

172
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:14,262
I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.

173
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,349
Thank you for meeting me here.

174
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,477
My name is Yolanda Buenaventura
of the Better Business Bureau.

175
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,980
It would be funnier
if your name was Betty Buenaventura

176
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,315
of the Better Business Bureau.

177
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,859
Well, I'm sorry you don't find
my name sufficiently comical,

178
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,028
but this is actually
a very serious matter.

179
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,571
- Oh.
- We've received complaints

180
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:32,989
from several concerned parents.

181
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:35,283
It seems that many
of your clown dentists

182
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,660
aren't actually licensed
to practice medicine.

183
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,163
Isn't laughter the best medicine?

184
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:41,956
No. It is the worst medicine.

185
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,667
If you can even call it medicine,
which, legally, you cannot.

186
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,588
Well, what if I said my business
was for entertainment purposes?

187
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,132
That would require your employees
to be entertaining.

188
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:54,386
According to your reviews on Yelp,
your clown dentists are, quote,

189
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,264
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian
invention that shakes one to the core."

190
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:00,100
Ah, everyone's a critic.

191
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,185
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.

192
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:05,230
It appears your business provides
no service but to terrify children

193
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,731
and the adults who accompany them.

194
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,109
If this were October,
you could market your venture

195
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,111
as some sort of spooky
Halloween experience,

196
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,030
but since this is January,
a month which, to my knowledge,

197
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:16,616
contains no Halloweens,
I have no choice but to...

198
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,909
Wait! Wait.

199
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,203
What if my clown dentists
put on a show?

200
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:26,418
A delightful, whimsical,
non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?

201
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,961
You would have to agree

202
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:30,046
we were a legitimate
business then, right?

203
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,091
- Go on.
- Give us a week. We'll put on a show.

204
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,510
If you don't laugh,
I'll dissolve the business

205
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,513
and release all my clown dentists
into the woods,

206
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,890
where they'll never bother anyone again.

207
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:41,933
All right.

208
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,639
You have one week to create a show
that delights and astonishes me.

209
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:46,813
But I should warn you,
I am a very tough crowd.

210
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,941
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party
and I did not find him charming.

211
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,822
- [bell ringing]
- Ooh!

212
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,158
- Excuse me.
- [overlapping chatter]

213
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:01,286
- Get outta my way.
- Like, hooked in a funny way.

214
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,747
You call that funny?
That's not funny. It's sad.

215
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,916
Well, some would argue
that sad and funny

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,044
- are two sides of the same coin.
- [cries out]

217
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:13,047
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln
and some weird flat house

218
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:14,632
are two sides of the same coin.

219
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:16,676
- Take five, Picarello.
- [bell ringing]

220
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,888
[groans] I've got a week
to whip these dentists into clowns.

221
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:21,014
- [crashing]
- [moaning]

222
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:23,016
But they're just not silly or wacky

223
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:25,685
or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind!

224
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:27,729
[sad quack]

225
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,939
- [gulping]
- [groans] Should you be drinking that?

226
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:35,069
Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? [hiccups]

227
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:39,199
- Um, shouldn't you be at work?
- I'm recal-bibrating.

228
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:40,450
- [horn honks]
- Oh!

229
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,535
- [horn honking]
- Ohh...

230
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,120
Hey, maybe you should...

231
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:48,041
- [phone buzzing]
- Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

232
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:51,211
- You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.
- [groans]

233
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,254
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

234
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,924
What gal?

235
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:02,263
- So, you're a writer?
- Oh, actually that's a typo.

236
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,640
It should say "Waiter."

237
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:06,100
- But I'm an aspiring writer.
- Uh-huh.

238
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:07,519
Sorry, that was a joke.

239
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,802
That's the kind of witty repartee
you can expect from...

240
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,564
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.

241
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:12,774
Wait, ya know,

242
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:15,235
- I have this idea for a TV show.
- Oh?

243
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:18,238
It's a grizzled former detective
who gets sucked back in...

244
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,489
This sounds fabulous.

245
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:21,532
Why don't you write a script,
we'll go from there?

246
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,661
- I already wrote it. Boom.
- Oh, you brought it with you.

247
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,664
I don't trust email.
You know, the government.

248
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,874
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,

249
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,919
I should tell you
that this town's a total crapshoot.

250
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,802
Odds of the right person
finding your material

251
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,050
and connecting with it
are a million to... one.

252
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:43,596
I just know I have this great potential
inside me. I know I can do it.

253
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,808
Even if no one else understands
or believes in me.

254
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,643
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...

255
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:51,771
It's not stupid. I believe in you.

256
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:55,733
I don't know how else to describe it

257
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:59,153
other than this feeling
of supreme warmth came over me,

258
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,406
like this is what I've been waiting for
my whole life.

259
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,699
That's amazing!

260
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:06,286
Todd, the world is dark and scary
and full of creepy clown dentists...

261
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,454
They're working very hard
to be less creepy.

262
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:11,249
But when I hold this script in my hands,
I have hope.

263
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:13,918
I gotta get this made.
What do I always say?

264
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,170
"What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?"

265
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,881
Uh, managers are always
talking about the differences

266
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:22,051
between agents and managers
and agents don't as much?

267
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:25,805
No! Managers can produce!
This script is a sign.

268
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,099
I gotta get off my ass
and produce this baby.

269
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,309
Todd? [hiccups]

270
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:32,103
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.

271
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,688
Who is this gal?

272
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:36,941
[snoring]

273
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:39,944
Okay. Clentists, assemble!

274
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:41,404
[clowns clamoring]

275
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:44,115
Wipe those serious looks
off your faces and listen up!

276
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,658
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,

277
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:48,369
but also we gotta prep
for our big show next week.

278
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,247
If only there was a way
to do both at once.

279
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,374
What a ludicrous notion!

280
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,045
Doctor Picarello,
we might make a clown out of you yet!

281
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:59,130
Oh, joy!

282
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,549
[cackling]

283
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,176
Special delivery.

284
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,806
This next part is critical. Remain wacky.
This is a highly frivolous situation!

285
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:14,604
- What's in the package?
- It's a hand delivery item.

286
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:15,730
Hey!

287
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:19,734
- Now, Doctor Boing Boing!
- I am in position.

288
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:24,447
[straining]

289
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,699
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

290
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:29,118
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

291
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:33,247
Before, so it's really the avocado
thing that I have a problem with.

292
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:35,416
[grunts]

293
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,712
Target is acquired.

294
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,382
[mimics static] Deliver the goods,
Doctor Boing Boing!

295
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,009
Ah!

296
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:47,804
It's sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-showtime!

297
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,722
- Whoa!
- Oh!

298
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:52,517
- Princess Carolyn!
- Lenny, thanks for making time.

299
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,060
Didn't realize I had.

300
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:55,645
[sniffing] Are you drunk?

301
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,772
You smell like somebody
tried to put out a fire

302
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,440
at the booze factory with more booze.

303
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:02,068
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.

304
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:04,821
Now let's get to brass stacks.

305
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:08,825
So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV. It's me producing.

306
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,660
- "TV?"
- Just look at this script.

307
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,912
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.

308
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,580
Eh...

309
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,866
Know that website,
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

310
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,836
you go to when you want
to know what time it is?

311
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,837
Yeah.

312
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,506
They look to make a play
in the gritty prestige streaming world,

313
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:25,925
and it could make a big splash
with a huge ad buy.

314
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,720
Plus, you got the built-in audience
who don't know what time it is.

315
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,930
That's huge! That's so many people!

316
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,266
Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect
as their first series,

317
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:34,642
but we'd have to get in fast.

318
00:14:34,726 --> 00:14:36,477
They wanna premiere
before Daylight Savings.

319
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:38,271
Let's set the pitch for next week.

320
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,106
Philbert? Who's Philbert?

321
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,734
He's this grizzled
but very good-looking detective

322
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,986
who gets sucked back in to something.

323
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,154
No, I mean who is he?

324
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,030
- You got a star attached?
- Not yet, but...

325
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,824
Eh, we can't go in without a big name.

326
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:53,661
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,
it's nothing without a big star.

327
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:54,954
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.

328
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,330
No! Fish!

329
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:59,751
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

330
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:03,755
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.

331
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:07,049
[mimics static] Don't let Turtletaub
get back to his office.

332
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,887
This sounds like a job
for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

333
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,431
[Todd] Doctor Picarello,
you gotta revive Princess Carolyn.

334
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,433
Give her ten cc's of honka-honka.

335
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,726
- Stat!
- [honking]

336
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:17,852
Oh!
[groans]

337
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,396
Hey! Hey! Pardon me. Excuse me!

338
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,065
- Oh! Allow me to lead, my lady.
- Wow.

339
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,652
- What the shell is this?
- So beautiful.

340
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,739
It says so much
without saying anything at all.

341
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,574
You gotta be kidding me.

342
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,284
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?

343
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,536
He owes me a favor
and he can disappear into any role.

344
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,498
Yeah, he can disappear so good,
the audience disappears with him.

345
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:40,041
- Tony Shalhoub!
- Tony Sha-who-ub?

346
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:42,502
This is
"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

347
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:44,420
not "What-time-is-it-fifteen-years-ago

Please. I need this so bad.
You don't understand.

350
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:53,888
This project is my ba...
[hiccups] my ba...

351
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,682
- It's my baby.
- Well, if you can't attach a real star,

352
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,142
- your baby's dead.
- No!

353
00:15:58,226 --> 00:15:59,602
Oh, thank you.

354
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:02,146
There's gotta be a name
that does something for you.

355
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,817
Uh, Jack Huston... Hugh... Hugh Jackman.

356
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,420
- BoJack Horseman!
- There's someone...

357
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,653
- Corbin Bernsen.
- No.

358
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,696
- Ben Mendelsohn.
- No, no, no. Hold on.

359
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,659
- BoJack. That's an idea.
- Yeah, yeah, sure. A BoJack-type.

360
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:16,902
[sighs] I swore I'd never work
with that asshole again,

361
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,538
but you gotta admit he's got heat.

362
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,123
Star of Secretariat,
disappears for a year,

363
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:25,002
shows up again to do one episode
of a reality show about butts.

364
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,003
Right, but...

365
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:29,006
And then you get him playing
a rich, complex anti-hero like Philbert,

366
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,844
now there's a show that screams,
"What time is it right now?"

367
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,136
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

368
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,805
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...

369
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:37,765
P.C., can you get me BoJack or not?

370
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:40,977
- Of course I can.
- I'll send over a contract, iron-clad.

371
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,354
I don't want to risk that jerkwad
skipping town again.

372
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,482
- Make sure he signs it before the pitch.
- Uh, will do.

373
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:50,778
And, uh, go easy on the sauce, huh, kid?
Sloppy don't suit you.

Ah, I got that damn thing
stuck in my head.

376
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,952
Guys, that was amazing!

377
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:01,205
But if we're going to convince Yolanda
we're ready for the big top,

378
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,583
we need to really hunker down
over the next week

379
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,003
and put together a show
so undeniably hilarious

380
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:11,382
and life-affirming,
that she has no choice but to say...

381
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:17,346
Wow! What a great show!
Okay, you can keep your business...

382
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,639
- Hooray!
- Perfect!

383
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,309
Is what I would say
if you'd put on a good show.

384
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:24,312
Just so you understand the rubric
when I declare my actual reaction,

385
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:25,897
which is: "I did not enjoy that."

386

- [clamoring]
- Oh, no! My hooray was premature!

387
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:33,529
So I must recommend that
you dissolve this venture immediately.

388
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,824
All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.

389
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:40,828
I'm taking you to the woods,
out by the old abandoned insane asylum,

390
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:43,456
near the elementary school
where you belong.

Hey, so I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

394
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,754
What? Why?

395
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,464
Just don't feel like working right now,

396
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:55,251
so I think if I force it,
I'm just gonna do a bad job.

397
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,341
Thank you, Stuart.

398
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,892
But I did want to remind you
about that bitch meeting you have

399
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:02,266
- this afternoon at that clock website.
- You mean the pitch meeting.

400
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,186
Pretty sure it said "bitch" meeting
on the calendar.

401
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,647
Seemed a little harsh.
I could go double-check,

402
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,775
but the calendar's
all the way downstairs so...

403
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,527
- No, Stuart. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

- Hey, BoJack, great news!

- Bad time. Can't talk.
- Wait, just listen for a...

Okay.

00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,216
Here we go, baby.

411
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,098
Oh, man!
You are not finding what you need!

412
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,476
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.
Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!

413
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,521
Tina is drawing so many cards.
It's amazing.

414
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,940
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?

415
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,067
- [body thuds in distance]
- Hollyhock?

416
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,276
[woman] That's her name?

417
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,445
Yes, for the third time,
her name is "Hollyhock."

418
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:57,571
And her last name?

419
00:18:57,655 --> 00:19:00,950
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...

420
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,201
Is there more?

421
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,495
I think there's a Lopez
in the mix somewhere?

422
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:05,830
A Chung maybe?

423
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,873
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.

424
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:10,418
Okay, just... any information
you can give me

425
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,795
on the 17-year-old horse girl
who came here by ambulance

426
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:14,964
15 minutes ago would be
of interest to my friend,

427
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,633
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.

428
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,136
If you can't prove you're
her parent or legal guardian,

429
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,929
I can't release any information to you.

430
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,055
- Guerrero!
- What?

432
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:29,020
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.

433
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:30,182
And she's about five-eight.

434
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:31,981
And she's 17,
her birthday is in September.

435
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:34,025
And... she looks like me.

436
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,985
And she loves apples
but hates apple sauce.

437
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,111
And she's funny.

438
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:41,240
But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable,

439
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,993
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think
you have to be mean to be funny,

440
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:46,746
but Hollyhock is very sweet,

441
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,122
even if she can be sarcastic.

442
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:51,876
But she has this smile with...

443
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,044
Does that help?

444
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,337
No, man.
Are you her legal guardian?

445
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:57,423
I'm not leaving here
until I get to see her.

Well, I don't like
pedophile murderer hands,

448
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,972
but I also don't like people
talking trash about avocados.

449
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:07,558
- This is a real head-scratcher for me.
- [groans]

450
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:11,187
I mean, what's next?
The grief for every meal...

451
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,189
- [man] She'll be fine.
- Huh?

452
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:14,952
We have to think
what's best for Hollyhock.

453
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,068
- Hollyhock is going to be okay.
- Excuse me.

454
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,694
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you...

00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:22,782
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.
I'm BoJack Horseman.

00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:25,076
Yeah, we know.
I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.

She will be.
The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.

What happened?

Quack, quack!

She told us you were
taking care of her.
