00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,065
ALBERT EIN-DOUCHE.

847
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,095
>> Beth: WHAT?

848
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,164
>> Jerry: I'M AN ANGRY FATHER,

849
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,164
NOT AN IMPROVISOR.

850
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,664
>> Rick: OH, HI, JERRY.

851
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,625
OH, MY GOODNESS, MORTY!

852
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,694
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF CLASS?

853
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,724
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

854
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,125
YOUR YOUR PARENTS AND I ARE

855
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,424
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IN THIS

856
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:20,894
BEHAVIOR.

857
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,065
NO? NO TAKERS?

858
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,894
YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY NOT BE

859
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:24,625
TOUCHING THAT STUFF.

860
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,595
IT'S BEYOND YOUR REASONING.

861
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,224
>> Jerry: YOU'REBEYOND OUR

862
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,125
REASONING!

863
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,194
>> Rick: TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

864
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,494
>> Beth: DAD, HOW COULD YOU MAKE

865
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,994
MY SON MISS AN ENTIRE SEMESTER

866
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,795
OF SCHOOL?

867
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,865
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S A HOT

868
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,565
GIRL.

869
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,694
HE CAN'T JUST BAIL ON HIS LIFE

870
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:35,694
AND SET UP SHOP IN SOMEONE

871
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:36,424
ELSE'S.

872
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,525
>> Rick: WHAT WHAT ARE YOU

873
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,724
GUYS DOING WITH MY STUFF?

874
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,424
>> Beth: WE'RE MOVING YOU... TO A

875
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:41,295
NURSING HOME.

876
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,464
>> Rick: A NURSING HOME?

877
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,394
WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

878
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,295
I'M A GENIUS.

879
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,365
I BUILD ROBOTS FOR FUN.

880
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,394
>> Jerry: WELL, NOW YOU CAN

881
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,494
BUILD BASKETS AND WATCH

882
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,394
PAUL NEWMAN MOVIES ON VHS AND

883
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,464
MENTALLY SCAR THE BOY SCOUTS

884
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,365
EVERY CHRISTMAS.

885
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,164
>> Beth: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

886
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,095
>> Jerry: IT'S PERSONAL.

887
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,424
>> Morty: DAD, MOM, C-COME ON.

888
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,565
RICK JUST NEEDED MY HELP IS ALL.

889
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,325
>> Jerry: MORTY, STAY OUT OF

890
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,265
THIS.

891
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,464
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT CAPABLE OF

892
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:00,265
JUDGING THESE SITUATIONS ON YOUR

893
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,194
OWN.

894
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,095
>> Rick: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO

895
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,095
SAY ABOUT MORTY?

896
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,295
THAT HE'S STUPID OR SOMETHING?

897
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,095
>> Beth: OH, DON'T HIGH-ROAD US,

898
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,065
DAD.

899
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,525
YOU KNOW FULLY WELL THAT MORTY

900
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,994
IS THE LAST CHILD THAT NEEDS TO

901
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,224
BE MISSING CLASSES.

902
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,065
>> Rick: I-I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT

903
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,694
YOU MEAN BY THAT.

904
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:12,694
CAN CAN CAN YOU BE A

905
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:13,724
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC?

906
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,625
>> Jerry: OH, FOR CRYING OUT

907
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,595
HE'S GOT SOME KIND OF

908
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,724
DISABILITY OR SOMETHING.

909
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,194
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT US TO SAY?

910
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,664
>> Morty: I DO?

911
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,224
>> Jerry: WELL, DUH DOY, SON.

912
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,694
LOOK, I LOVE YOU, MORTY, BUT WE

913
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,265
BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT AS FAST AS

914
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,595
THE OTHER KIDS, AND IF YOU WANT

915
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,025
TO COMPETE IN THIS WORLD, YOU

916
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,224
GOT TO WORK TWICE AS HARD.

917
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,865
>> Morty: AW, GEEZ, DAD.

918
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,125
Y-YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT TO DROP

919
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,224
ON A KID ALL AT ONCE.

920
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,424
>> Rick: MORTY, T-TELL YOUR

921
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,565
PARENTS THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI.

922
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,565
>> Morty: OH, COME ON, RICK.

923
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,625
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

924
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,765
>> Rick: THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI,

925
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,424
MORTY GO.

926
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,825
>> Morty: 1.77245385.

927
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,964
WHOA!

928
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,394
>> Beth: WHAT THE HELL?

929
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,994
>> Jerry: HOLY CRAP. HE'S RIGHT.

930
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,194
>> Rick: MORTY, TELL YOUR

931
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,265
PARENTS THE FIRST LAW OF [BURPS]

932
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,295
THERMODYNAMICS.

933
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,595
>> Morty: "THE INCREMENT IN THE

934
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,825
INTERNAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM IS

935
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,164
EQUAL TO THE INCREMENT OF HEAT

936
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:55,394
SUPPLIED TO THE SYSTEM."

937
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,424
WOW! I'M SO SMART!

938
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,625
>> Jerry: BUT

939
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,164
>> Rick: I TOLD THE BOTH OF

940
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,365
YOU SCHOOL IS STUPID.

941
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,724
IT'S NOT HOW YOU LEARN THINGS.

942
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,964
MORTY'S A GIFTED CHILD.

943
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:04,095
HE HAS A SPECIAL MIND.

944
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,964
THAT'S WHY HE'S MY LITTLE

945
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:05,894
HELPER.

946
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,994
HE'S LIKE ME.

947
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,424
HE'S GONNA BE DOING GREAT

948
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,125
SCIENCE STUFF LATER IN HIS LIFE.

949
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,424
HE'S TOO SMART FOR SCHOOL.

950
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,295
H-HE NEEDS TO KEEP HANGING OUT

951
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,795
[BURPS] AND HELPING ME.

952
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,194
>> Beth: JERRY, I DON'T WANT

953
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,025
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING HERE TO

954
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,765
STOP.

955
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,125
>> Jerry: NO, I-I UNDERSTAND.

956
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,724
UH, MAYBE WE OVERREACTED.

957
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,295
BUT HE HAS TO KEEP GOING TO

958
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,125
SCHOOL.

959
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,325
>> Rick: OKAY, JERRY.

960
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,595
YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, BUT

961
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,724
[BURPS] WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO

962
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:28,295
DO?

963
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,565
SAY [BURPS] SAY NO?

964
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,525
YOU YOU REALLY WEAR THE PANTS

965
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,565
AROUND HERE.

966
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,765
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, BETWEEN

967
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,194
US, FROM NOW ON, IT'S GONNA BE

968
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,164
100% HONESTY AND OPEN, CLEAR

969
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,224
COMMUNICATION.

970
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,464
>> Summer: FRANK PALICKY WAS

971
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,664
FROZEN TO DEATH TODAY!

972
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:40,394
>> Rick: NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE

973
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,125
TALKING ABOUT.

974
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,865
>> Summer: [ SOBBING ]

975
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,494
>> Jerry: OKAY.

976
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,525
WELL, UH, MORTY, IT'S YOUR

977
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,765
BEDTIME IN AN HOUR.

978
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,295
DON'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT AGAIN.

979
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,325
THIS IS GOOD, THOUGH.

980
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,724
THIS CAN WORK.

981
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,494
I THINK WE CAN BE A FAMILY.

982
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,194
AND NOW, BETH, IF YOU'LL HAVE

983
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,565
ME, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

984
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,765
>> Beth: YOU KNOW WHAT?

985
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,365
OKAY.

986
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,565
>> Morty: HOLY COW, RICK.

987
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,694
I DIDN'T KNOW HANGING OUT WITH

988
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,025
YOU WAS MAKING ME SMARTER.

989
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,025
>> Rick: FULL DISCLOSURE,

990
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,664
MORTY IT'S NOT.

991
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,194
TEMPORARY SUPERINTELLIGENCE IS

992
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,565
JUST A SIDE EFFECT OF THE MEGA

993

996
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,765
>> Rick: YEAH, AND ONCE THOSE

997
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,164
SEEDS [BURPS] WEAR OFF, YOU'RE

998
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,194
GONNA LOSE MOST OF YOUR MOTOR

999
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,565
SKILLS, AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA

1000
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,025
LOSE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

1001
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,095
BRAIN FUNCTIONALITY FOR 72

1002
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,365
HOURS, MORTY.

1003
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,825
STARTING [BURPS] RIGHT ABOUT

1004
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,394

>> Rick: I'M SORRY, MORTY.

1008
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:27,525
IT'S A BUMMER.

1009
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,394
IN REALITY, YOU'RE AS DUMB AS

1010
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,394
THEY COME.

1011
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,595
AND I NEEDED THOSE SEEDS REAL

1012
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,095
