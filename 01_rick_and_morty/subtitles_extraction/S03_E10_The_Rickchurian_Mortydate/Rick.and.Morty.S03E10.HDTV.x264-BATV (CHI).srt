everything you want,

You couldn't say that in a text?

each other again, my...

My grandson has
worked hard for you,

331
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,140
- Honestly, I could take it or leave
it at this point. - You're taking it.

No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

From subordination

- Not without a selfie.

- Arrest them.
- Son, you have a right to refuse his order,

343

and I guarantee you're going
to die if you touch me,

344
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,360

Everything just goes black.

- Okay.

What was that?

348
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,960
- Death.
- What kind?

349
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,040
- Instant.
- There was no sound.

350
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,330
- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

351
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,910
It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

352
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,230
It's called a deterrent.

353

You couldn't just knock him out?

354
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,370
How is knocking out a deterrent?

355
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,770
Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

356
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,100
Nobody wants to be dead.

357

You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

358

- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

359
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,180
I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

360
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,510
Uh, I don't need a selfie.

361
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,890
And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

362
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,010
and you aren't leaving.

363
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,210
- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

364
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,230
because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

365
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,320
Am I getting a selfie?

366
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,750
- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

367
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,950
- Exactly.
- See?

Does anyone have a shot?

369
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,520
Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

375
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,440
Because if there isn't
someone in here

376
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
that they're not
supposed to kill,

377
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,510
they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

378

if it isn't in
a selfie with him,

380
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,240

426
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,580
to the Milwaukee
Symphony Orchestra

427
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,380
performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

428
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,950
At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

429
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,020
when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

430
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,590
are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

431
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,360
I realized my palms
were so sweaty,

432
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,770
I would never get
to hold your hand.

433
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,230
But I was desperate
to touch you,

434
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,230
so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

435
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,170
But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

436
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
so I started
kind of jiggling it,

437
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,970
whipping it without
moving too much.

438
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,450
But you started looking over,
and I thought,

439
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,480
"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

440
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,720
and I'll never get to touch her.

441
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,180
But I still have time
to touch her."

442
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,740
But my hand had Snickers on it,

443
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,480
and the brass section
was swelling

444
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,060
because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

445
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
And I just thought, "fuck it.
Lips don't sweat."

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,690
Wow. Yeah.

So where did you go?
I can't tell you.

Rick, did you tell my mom
she might be a clone?

484
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,830
No! I told her she wasn't!

485
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,500
Well, isn't that
what you'd tell a clone?

486
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,700
Oh, for Christ's sake.

487
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,570
Rick, my mom and dad
are getting back together.

488
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,640
What? No!
She's not a clone!

489
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,250
Well, she says it doesn't
matter if she is or isn't

490
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,540
because now she loves my dad,

491
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,340
and she wanted me
and Summer to come home,

492
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,440
and we're hiding from you
so you don't kill her

if she's a clone in a place

494
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,680
I picked that
you will never find.

495
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,180
So don't look for us.

496
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Come on, bitch!

497
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,790
Oh, you come on, bitch.

498
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,450
I'm out. I'm done.

499
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,760
I've got to...
I've got to go.

500
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,230
So I win. Then I'm in charge,
and you can't leave.

501
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,840
You're a terrorist.
You're an enemy of the state,

502
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,470
and you kicked me in the balls
10 minutes ago!

503
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,230
The office of the President
can't coexist

504
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,230
with a living god
that won't submit to it...

505
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,730
I mean, besides Poseidon.

506

But he's locked up
in Area 51 already,

507
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,770
so that doesn't really count.

508
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,370
Mr. President,
I'll make you a deal.

I can go take care of something,

Of course, you're not my dad.

You're here with a gun

I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

526
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,210
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

527
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,850
But I don't relate to her.

528
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,420
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

529

So if you kill me, fine.

530
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,060
You're not killing her.

But you're killing
a real family.

532
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,260
And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

533
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,840
Aren't there, like,
infinite time lines?

534

of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

making you proud

Why would I stay in the one

563

became an enemy of America

There's still some rubble

Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

572

You can distinguish me from the Rick
that you had a falling-out with

575
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,050
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

576
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,550
I hope I can be of service

577

the planet to be in danger.
