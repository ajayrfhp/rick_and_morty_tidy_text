with it in the first place.

00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,188
     That's why

            Anyone continuing to
            explore the Citadel 
            is either stupid    

33
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,357
                  or one of     
        the unfortunate millions

        by their terrible ideas.

35

           in sight
